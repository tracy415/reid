    <description><![CDATA[Due to low supply, the median home price reached a new high for the month of January.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales decreased by 8.4% in January, according to the National Association of Realtors Existing-Home Sales report released earlier today. Month-over-month and year-over-year sales fell in all regions.</p><blockquote>“The decrease in sales is disappointing. The below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation this January make it harder than usual to assess the underlying driver of the decrease and determine if this month’s numbers are an aberration,” said NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun. “Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR’s Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it’s been since March 2022. This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Due to low supply, the median home price reached a new high for the month of January,” Yun added. “Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth.”</blockquote><p>Affordability improved for the seventh consecutive month, according to NAR’s Housing Affordability Index—increasing to 116.5 in January from 111.6 in December and 102 a year ago.</p><h2 id="national-snapshot">National Snapshot</h2><h3 id="total-existing-home-sales-for-january"><br>Total Existing-Home Sales for January</h3><ul>

    <description><![CDATA[Overall, the region remains in high demand, with all areas continuing to experience exceptional competition for homes.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors released the area’s January 2026 year-over-year housing statistics on Thursday, Feb. 12, with sales prices rising in the region, fueled in part by continued tight inventory levels.</p><p>Westchester County closed January in a tight housing market. The month showed the median price for a single-family home is up 3.4% year-over-year to $915,000. There are only 1.8 months of inventory, down from 2.1 months in January 2025, while active listings are down 10% and closed sales are down 15%. The days on market remain low at 29, and 100% of the properties selling for the asking price or higher.</p><p>The Bronx is experiencing a more balanced housing market with 6.7 months of inventory. Single-family median home prices increased 4.5% year-over-year to $671,500. Active listings went up 7.3%, while closed sales rose slightly by 1%. Homes spent 54 days on the market in this area, and 98.4% sold for their original price.</p><p>The median sale price for Bronx condos rose 8% to $375K and by 9% to $262K for co-ops. Months of supply for condos and co-ops also increased 16% and 10%, respectively. New condo listings increased to 36, a 63% jump, while there were 100 new co-op listings, an increase of 6.4% in January 2026 compared to last year.</p><blockquote>“Overall, the region remains in high demand, with all areas continuing to experience exceptional competition for homes,” 2026 HGAR President Rey Hollingsworth Falu said. “While markets across the country are experiencing a softening housing market, we continue to have a need for more homes to meet growing demands.”</blockquote><p>Putnam County housing statistics indicate that homeowners are listing their homes more slowly than last year, with active listings down 8.6%. The data underscores the county's popularity, with only 1.7 months of inventory compared to 2.2 months in 2025 and closed sales up 32%. The median single-family home price went up 0.4% to $575,000.</p><p>Rockland County’s tight housing market has remained flat year-over-year with 2.5 months of inventory, and active listings up 8.4%. Homes were on the market 34 days, with 99% of the properties selling for the original price. Closed sales went down 0.6%, and the median price for a single-family home rose 0.9% to $750,000.</p><p>Orange County is a tight, yet more balanced housing market than the surrounding counties, with 3.1 months of inventory. Active listings declined by 5.7%, and closed sales declined by 2.2%. Homes stayed on the market for 47 days, and 98.8% sold for their original price, while the median single-family home increased by 3.2% to $490,000.</p><p>“Due to the tight housing market, buyers should be prepared to act quickly and be prepared to offer at or above current asking prices,” HGAR’s Falu said. “A Realtor can help buyers make strategic decisions during what can be a very emotional transaction process.”</p><h3 id="january-2026-year-over-year-median-priceall-property-types-single-family-condo-and-co-op">January 2026 Year-Over-Year Median Price - All Property Types (Single-Family, Condo and Co-op)</h3><p>• Westchester County: $692,500, down 1.1%<br>• Orange County: $450,000, up 8%<br>• The Bronx: $419,500, down 4.7%<br>• Putnam County: $575,000, up 7%<br>• Rockland County: $670,000, down 2.9%</p><p>NOTE: Link to ALL regional reports:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hgar.com/news-stats/market-stats" rel="noreferrer">Market Data | Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS®</a>&nbsp;Scroll down to 2026 Market Stats</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[It is recommended that all real estate brokerage firms, including commercial brokerages, enter into detailed agreements with their buyer/tenant or seller/landlord clients.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real estate commission disputes are among the most common and costly forms of real estate litigation in New York. They are also among the most preventable. The <em>Capin &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Herskovitz </em>(1st Dept., 2021) [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/4rhSdhD">https://bit.ly/4rhSdhD</a>] case underscores a central reality that when the engagement terms are undocumented or vague, and a transaction later closes through another path, a broker’s commission claim will be difficult to establish.</p><h3 id="capin-case-in-a-nutshell-broken-causal-chain-defeats-a-commission-claim">Capin Case in a Nutshell:<br>Broken Causal Chain Defeats a Commission Claim</h3><p>In Capin, the plaintiff broker sought compensation in connection with a multi‑building sale. There was no explicit written brokerage agreement. After the broker’s involvement ended, and after being informed that the properties were “no longer for sale,” another brokerage firm contacted the buyer, handled negotiations and due diligence and closed the deal. The court found that Capin was not the “procuring cause” of the transaction and affirmed dismissal of its implied contract claim.</p><p>Capin is a reminder that courts will not award a commission simply because a broker invested time or helped “open the door” and introduced a buyer to a seller. Absent clear exclusivity, the broker must prove a direct and causal connection to the consummated transaction.</p><h3 id="the-basic-new-york-rules-an-agreement-%E2%80%9Cready-willing-and-able%E2%80%9D-and-procuring-cause">The Basic New York Rules:<br>An Agreement, “Ready, Willing and Able,” and Procuring Cause</h3><p>Commission entitlement in New York commonly revolves around three principles. First, there must be an enforceable basis for compensation. Ideally, a written contract is the best basis for entitlement to a commission on a real estate transaction. However, in certain circumstances when the facts show a meeting of the minds, an implied arrangement may establish a sufficient basis to support a commission claim in real estate transactions. Second, unless the broker holds an exclusive right, customarily through a written agreement, making causation irrelevant, the broker must establish it was the “procuring cause” of the completed transaction. Third, many decisions reiterate the traditional rule that a broker earns a commission when it produces a buyer who is “ready, willing and able” to purchase on the seller’s terms.</p><p>“Ready, willing and able” generally means the buyer is prepared to proceed on the seller’s terms and has the ability to do so, and many times can be established easily. “Procuring cause” is usually one of the more difficult elements to establish when there is no written agreement. Courts in the First Department have held that brokers must show a “direct and proximate link” between its efforts and the closing. Any breaks in the chain of causation (for example, time, intervening brokers, pauses in negotiations or independent re‑engagement) can defeat the claim.</p><p>These standards are rooted in long-standing New York commission jurisprudence. The 1881 case of <em>Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co</em>. is frequently cited for the proposition that a broker is not entitled to compensation unless the broker is the “efficient procuring cause” of the bargain, and that a principal may, in good faith, terminate the broker’s agency before a deal is made. More recently, <em>SPRE Realty, Ltd. v. Dienst</em> (1st Dept., 2014) [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4bOMxGV">https://bit.ly/4bOMxGV</a>] reaffirmed that the inquiry focuses on whether the broker’s efforts bear a direct and proximate link to the ultimate transaction, not whether the broker was merely involved at an earlier stage.</p><h3 id="statute-of-frauds-gol-%C2%A7-5-701-and-why-a-written-agreement-still-matters">Statute of Frauds GOL § 5-701 and<br>Why a Written Agreement Still Matters</h3><p>General Obligations Law (“GOL”) § 5‑701 [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4ky3qYC">https://bit.ly/4ky3qYC</a>] (commonly referred to as the Statute of Frauds) generally requires that most agreements be in writing (with certain exceptions). One such exception is detailed in GOL, § 5‑701(a)(10) which provides that the writing requirement “…shall not apply to a contract to pay compensation to an auctioneer, an attorney at law, or a duly licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman.” The Capin case shows why this exception is not a guaranty of a successful commission claim. Even if an implied claim is legally available, the absence of a written agreement creates ambiguities about the scope, exclusivity, commission payment triggers, what happens if the client uses another broker, as well as other issues, and these ambiguities will undoubtedly create litigation risks when there is no written agreement.</p><h3 id="licensing-a-threshold-requirement-rpl-%C2%A7-442-d">Licensing: A Threshold Requirement (RPL § 442-d)</h3><p>Real Property Law § 442‑d [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4rNxKRk">https://bit.ly/4rNxKRk</a>] bars recovery of any real estate brokerage compensation if the claimant is not a duly licensed broker, associate broker or salesperson. In practice, a commission case can fail quickly if Section 442‑d is not satisfied, regardless of whether procuring cause is established or if a ready, willing and able purchaser was introduced to the seller.</p><p>According to Section 442-d, “No person, co-partnership, limited liability company or corporation shall bring or maintain an action in any court of this state for the recovery of compensation… without alleging and proving that such person was a duly licensed real estate broker or real estate salesperson on the date when the alleged cause of action arose.”</p><h3 id="recent-decisions-causation-and-contracts-are-strictly-enforced">Recent Decisions: Causation and Contracts are Strictly Enforced</h3><p>Other recent New York decisions continue to reinforce the same themes that drove the outcome in the Capin, such as clear contract mechanics and a provable causal relationship. In <em>Macklowe Inv. Props. LLC v. MIP 57th Dev. Acquisition LLC </em>(1st Dept., 2025) [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4rfMecS">https://bit.ly/4rfMecS</a>], the court addressed a commission claim where a letter agreement required execution of a separate commission agreement as a condition precedent to receiving any commission. However, because the condition was not satisfied, the claim failed, showing that even where a writing exists, it may not establish the underlying right to a commission if the broker does not comply with conditions contained in that previously executed agreement.</p><p>In <em>Angelic Real Estate, LLC v. Aurora Props., LLC</em> (2d Dept., 2025) [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/4arSlUo">https://bit.ly/4arSlUo</a>], the court rejected a commission claim where the agreement did not clearly and unequivocally confer an exclusive right and the broker could not prove it was the “procuring cause” as required under common law. While this case involved a different context, the same principle applied: if exclusivity is not clear, causation will control.</p><h3 id="practical-business-case-for-written-brokerage-agreements">Practical Business Case for Written Brokerage Agreements</h3><p>Written brokerage agreements are risk-management tools. They prevent disputes about whether the broker was engaged at all, whether the engagement was exclusive, when and how the commission is earned, and how payment of compensation, if applicable, will be handled if the transaction is consummated through another channel or not at all.</p><p>While many real estate agents representing residential property sellers or landlords enter into exclusive agency and listing agreements providing clear parameters as to the payment of commissions, many commercial real estate brokers do not. It is recommended that all real estate brokerage firms, including commercial brokerages, enter into detailed agreements with their buyer/tenant or seller/landlord clients.</p><p>In 2026, buyer-side documentation is now especially important in light of the settlement in the <em>Sitzer/Burnett v. National Association of REALTORS®</em> case [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/468YZxA">https://bit.ly/468YZxA</a>]. Compensation expectations and the scope of services should be discussed at the very initial stages, before any showings, before any offer strategy is discussed, and before any of the common transaction’s pressure points. As required by the Sitzer/Burnett settlement, with regard to residential transactions, the compensation structure needs to be agreed to in advance, and in writing, by all parties and must be clear and conspicuous. It must also be clearly disclosed that all commissions are negotiable and there are no set commissions under the law or otherwise.</p><h3 id="proposed-ny-legislation-written-buyer-representation-agreements">Proposed NY Legislation:<br>Written Buyer Representation Agreements</h3><p>In addition to the requirements established by existing case law, the market and policy environment also continues to develop with a move toward mandatory written buyer representation agreements. In the 2025–2026 legislative session in New York, Assembly Bill A8910 [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/3OIb1b6">https://bit.ly/3OIb1b6</a>] was introduced proposing an amendment to the Real Property Law to require buyer-broker agreements for certain services and to mandate clear and conspicuous compensation disclosures. Additionally, Assembly Bill A5499 [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/3Mvzgc2">https://bit.ly/3Mvzgc2</a>] similarly includes representation agreement requirements as part of broader brokerage and agency reforms. NYSAR has also publicly identified written buyer representation agreements as a legislative priority [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/46A3ph6">https://bit.ly/46A3ph6</a>].</p><p>This legislative movement follows the national settlement in Sitzer/Burnett and related litigation, which resulted in significant changes to broker compensation practices, placing emphasis on written buyer representation agreements and transparent compensation disclosures nationwide. Although the Sitzer/Burnett litigation arose outside New York, its practical impact has influenced brokerage practices across the country, including in New York, where policymakers and industry leaders are evaluating statutory requirements to formalize written buyer and seller agreements and to clarify compensation structures.</p><p>If enacted, these proposals would formalize what many firms already view as best practice: have buyers (and sellers) sign a written agreement early, ensure that compensation is disclosed clearly, and establish detailed ground rules between the parties so that disputes and costly litigations can be avoided.</p><h3 id="what-to-include-in-a-commission-agreement">What to Include in a Commission Agreement</h3><p>At a minimum, a strong seller or buyer agreement should address the scope of the representation (i.e., property, search area, and services). It should address whether the engagement is exclusive or non-exclusive and should be stated clearly. Of course, a clear recital of compensation and payment requirements must be included (i.e., the commission amount, who pays, when it is earned, and how shortfalls, if any, are handled).</p><p>A commission or representation agreement must also include provisions that clearly include the term (i.e., the duration) of the agreement, termination and expiration of the agreement, and any protection or holdover period, usually referred to as the “tail” period. Agreements may also contain language that protects a seller, such as “if, as, and when” language, in the event a transaction fails to close. For buyer agreements, clarity around compensation is essential. Now, particularly in light of Sitzer/Burnett, it is important that agreements detail whether a commission payment is expected from the seller/listing broker, directly from the buyer, or both.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The case law highlights the risks and issues that may arise without clear written terms and a provable causal chain. A claim for a commission can evaporate even where the broker invested real time and effort. With courts enforcing procuring cause and contract conditions strictly, and with the Sitzer/Burnett settlement and potential legislative initiatives moving toward mandatory written agreements, the safest approach is a written agreement which documents the engagement early, defines compensation clearly, and details the scope of the engagement concisely, ultimately preserving rights to commission in the event a dispute ever arises.</p><p><em>About the author: Legal Corner Column author John Dolgetta, Esq., is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Month-over-month pending home sales rose in the Midwest and West, and declined in the Northeast and South.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—U.S. pending home sales in January decreased by 0.8% from the prior month and 0.4% year-over-year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report released today.</p><p>Month-over-month pending home sales rose in the Midwest and West, and declined in the Northeast and South. Year-over-year pending home sales rose in the South and West and declined in the Northeast and Midwest.</p><blockquote>“Improving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,” said NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun. “With mortgage rates nearing 6%, an additional 5.5 million households that could not qualify for a mortgage one year ago would qualify at today’s lower rates. Most newly qualifying households do not act immediately, but based on past experience, about 10% could enter the market—potentially adding roughly 550,000 new homebuyers this year compared with last year.”</blockquote><p>“Unless housing supply increases, these additional potential buyers becoming active in the market could simply push up home prices. This will put increasing pressure on affordability, which is why it is critical to increase supply by building more homes. Fortunately, the House of Representatives recently passed the Housing for the 21st Century Act with strong bipartisan support, an important signal that addressing the nation’s housing shortage remains a shared priority. The legislation is a meaningful step toward expanding housing supply and removing barriers that make it harder for Americans to achieve homeownership,” Yun added.</p><p>While national pending home sales fell slightly in January, several local markets are showing notable year-over-year gains.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE– The New York metropolitan housing market entered 2026 with rising home values, more contract activity, and persistent inventory challenges, according to new data released by OneKey MLS on Feb. 18.</p><p>Closed sales in the OneKey MLS service area declined 6.6% year-over-year to 3,503 in January 2026. However, the median sales price for all property types increased 4.3% to $677,777, reflecting ongoing price strength despite fewer transactions.</p><p>Single-family home sales, the region’s largest segment, fell 7.1% to 2,565, while median prices rose 4.7% to $748,500, underscoring steady demand for detached homes. Condominium sales increased 3.6% year-over-year, while co-op sales declined 13.6%. The median co-op sales price rose 2.3% to $301,900.</p><p>Inventory remains a key challenge.

The months' supply of inventory also fell to 2.9, maintaining competitive conditions across the region.</p><p>New listings dropped 7.0% year-over-year, reflecting continued seller caution and limiting buyer choices.

The average days on market decreased 14.3% year-over-year to 60, reflecting steady demand and continued buyer competition.</p><blockquote>“The housing market continues to demonstrate resilience as we begin 2026,” said Richard Haggerty, Chief Executive Officer of OneKey MLS. “While inventory remains constrained, improving contract activity and price stability indicate that demand remains strong. As mortgage rates stabilize, we expect opportunities for increased market balance and transaction growth throughout the year.”</blockquote><p>Housing affordability improved slightly, with the regional affordability index rising 4.3% year-over-year.
