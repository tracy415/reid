    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On June 10th, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, which marks the highest increase since December 1981. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3Hg0hZP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Hg0hZP</a>]. The increase in inflation was much higher than expected and will continue to put downward pressure on the economy into the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, with inflation coming in above expectations, the Federal Reserve must continue on its path of increasing interest rates. Increased interest rates are already having a noticeable impact on the real estate market, which will continue in the coming months.</p>
<p>According to the National Association of Realtors in its monthly report issued on May 19th, existing-home sales fell for a third straight month through April. NAR reported that “Total existing-home sales,<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/existing-home-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://www.nar.realtor/existing-home-sales</a>, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, slid 2.4% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.61 million in April. Year-over-year, sales dropped 5.9% (5.96 million in April 2021).” Nevertheless, the inventory of available real estate remains at historically low levels, which continues to make this a “seller’s market.”</p>
<p>In the coming months, with demand easing, purchasers may begin to experience increased bargaining power, but for now, it seems that leverage will continue to remain with sellers. It is more critical now than ever before, for real estate agents and attorneys to question whether it is in the best interest of purchasers to waive inspection, mortgage, appraisal contingencies and sale contingencies in order to win a successful bid on a property.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Seller’s Market’ and the Pressures of the Marketplace on Purchasers<br />
</strong><br />
Throughout history, it has been common for purchasers to say they have found the “perfect house” or the “perfect neighborhood.” The common theme among purchasers is that they do not want to lose the house to other potential purchasers. In the current market, the fear of losing a house or being outbid is magnified and the stress level is significantly increased. Multiple offers are commonplace and offers by purchasers well above the listing price occur on a frequent basis. Not only do purchasers offer tens of thousands of dollars above the asking price, they are also willing to waive inspection, financing, appraisal and sale contingencies.</p>
<p>Sellers continue to put pressure on their listing agents to accept only those offers with no (or very few) contingencies or all cash offers. They instruct their agents to tell buyers and buyers’ agents they will not reduce their price no matter what comes up in any inspections (if they even allow inspections to be conducted). They inform the buyers’ agents that the transaction is strictly “as is” and indicate that the sellers will not address or remedy any issue that comes up, nor will they include any contingencies in the contract.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because there is so little inventory, many purchasers are willing to waive these very important contingencies, and purchase a home without professional inspections being conducted. When this occurs, the buyer’s agent, to get the deal done, may be tempted to simply agree with them without explaining the full ramifications of such a decision.</p>
<p>Following the closing, if it is discovered that there exists, for example, an underground oil tank, oil spill, or dangerous levels of radon, purchasers will try to seek recourse from a seller (although case law and potential contract provisions will make this difficult), and will look to the purchasers’ attorney and real estate agents for recourse, especially if the cost of remediating these issues is high. It is critical for real estate agents and real estate attorneys to inform the client of all of the risks associated with making such a decision. It is also important for an agent to recommend that their clients consult with an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of the Purchaser’s Real Estate Agent and Attorney</strong></p>
<p>It is never appropriate for a real estate agent or attorney to recommend to a purchaser that the purchaser waive important contingencies, such as inspection, mortgage or appraisal contingencies just so the purchaser does not “lose the house.” A real estate agent, whether representing the buyer as a “client” or a “customer,” should never recommend or pressure any purchaser to waive critical contingencies. Real estate agents may find themselves being sued for breach of fiduciary duty (if the buyer is a client) or New York State&#8217;s covenant of good faith and fair dealing (if the buyer is a customer). Both real estate licensees and attorneys should disclose, in writing, that they advised buyers of the potential consequences of agreeing to any waivers.</p>
<p>New York law and customary “as is” provisions in the standard form of contract (and any riders annexed to the contract), will preclude a purchaser from pursuing an action against a seller with respect to, for example, the presence of an unknown underground oil storage tank, a leaking underground oil storage tank, lead based paint, a contaminated well, a failed septic system, asbestos in the premises, severe termite damage or other pest infestation, mold, high levels of radon or other issues.</p>
<p><strong>The Concept of Caveat Emptor: ‘Buyer Beware’</strong></p>
<p>The New York State Appellate Courts point out in various Appellate Division decisions (see <em>Hecker v. Pashke</em> (2015) (<a href="https://bit.ly/2VQ8uyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2VQ8uyQ</a>); <em>Daly v. Kochanowicz</em> (2009) (<a href="https://bit.ly/2YiFxt0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2YiFxt0</a>) and J<em>ablonski v. Rapalje</em> (2005) (<a href="https://bit.ly/2DViXyI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2DViXyI</a>)), that “In the context of real estate transactions, ‘New York adheres to the doctrine of caveat emptor and imposes no duty on the seller or the seller’s agent to disclose any information concerning the premises when the parties deal at arm’s length, unless there is some conduct on the part of the seller or the seller’s agent which constitutes active concealment.’” One critical takeaway from these “Caveat Emptor” decisions is that real estate agents should never infer or recommend that a buyer waive inspections or not undertake active and comprehensive due diligence.</p>
<p>Another notable decision issued by the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department in <em>Comora v. Franklin</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2H90yk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2H90yk4</a>) held that the seller and seller’s agent had no duty to disclose to the buyer, based on the doctrine of “Caveat Emptor” (i.e., “Buyer Beware”), the existence of humidity and mold in an indoor pool area of the home they purchased. The Comora case reaffirmed the doctrine of Caveat Emptor and emphasized that purchasers must be diligent and conduct thorough inspections of any property they wish to purchase. On the other hand, sellers, seller’s agents and the sellers’ attorneys must ensure that appropriate disclaimers are included in the contracts, that a purchaser is never “thwarted” from conducting inspections and that sellers never actively conceal a defect that would make its discovery impossible.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard “home inspection,” a buyer must be advised to have the following inspections conducted as well: radon, oil tank (for both underground and/or above ground tanks, including the recommendation of a metal detector test to locate the whereabouts of unknown tanks or other underground structures), lead paint, well and water, septic, asbestos, mold and termite/pest. Buyers in Westchester County, New York City and other local areas should be made aware that it is customary for inspections to be conducted before entering into a formal contract. And, although these contingencies are not normally included in the purchase contract, they are still considered contingencies of the transaction moving forward. If any issues do come up and a seller and/or purchaser decide not to proceed, the costs incurred for the inspections will be at the buyer’s expense.</p>
<p><strong>The Consequences of Waiving Critical Financial Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Purchasers have also been waiving critical finance, mortgage, appraisal contingencies, and/or sale contingencies. Real estate agents must ensure that purchasers understand, clearly and unequivocally, and preferably in writing, that unless they have the funds necessary to complete the purchase, should the financing fall through for any reason, they will likely forfeit their contract deposit, which can be significant (customarily 10% of the purchase price). Many times, buyers waive important financing contingencies based on loose and vague statements from mortgage representatives telling them not to worry about it—stating “we will get you the mortgage” without running the full application through the formal underwriting process.</p>
<p>Additionally, many purchasers are deciding to sell their current homes and wish to use the proceeds from the sale to complete their purchase. It is important for a purchaser’s real estate agent, as part of the initial negotiations, to inform the seller’s agent that a specific sale contingency provision must be included in the contract. Unless the purchaser has the full purchase price available in liquid funds, a sale contingency should never be waived.</p>
<p>There will certainly be push back from the seller’s agent and attorney, but if it is not included there are many unforeseen issues that could occur, which could cause the purchaser’s sale transaction to fall through. If a buyer’s sale transaction is conditioned on the buyer in that transaction obtaining a mortgage commitment and that buyer fails to obtain one and cancels that transaction, the purchaser would be in default and forfeit the down payment in the purchase transaction.</p>
<p><strong>The Concept of ‘As Is’—Many Times Misunderstood</strong></p>
<p>The concept of the “as is” transaction is commonly misunderstood by many of the parties in a real estate transaction. Even when buyers are permitted to conduct inspections, the seller and seller’s agent take the position that “no matter what comes up in an inspection, the deal is an “as is” deal and we will not negotiate the purchase price or remedy any issues.” Further, many sellers believe that even if an issue comes up after the contract has been signed, they are not required to remedy any such issues.</p>
<p>While most contracts include “as is” provisions, if an appliance included in the sale or other system (e.g., electrical, plumbing, sewer, septic, well, etc.) located on or at the premises was working at the time of an inspection, or at the time a contract was signed, then the standard contract provisions will still require that those appliances and systems be in working order at the time of closing. Sellers should be made aware that the “as is” concept does not mean they have no responsibility to ensure everything is in working order at closing. If, for example, there is a new leak in the plumbing, or there is new damage to the roof, that was not there at the time the contract was signed or at the time the property was inspected, then the seller would be required to remedy same prior to closing.</p>
<p>Similarly, a buyer should be informed of the “as is” concept as well because if they choose not to have inspections conducted, it will be difficult to establish whether an issue existed prior to the time the purchaser executed the contract. Below is an example of a disclosure an attorney or a real estate agent may make to the buyer-client:</p>
<p><em>It has been explained to you and you hereby acknowledge that New York State is a “buyer beware” state. Therefore, if you do not specifically request the seller (by asking us to include any such request in the contract of sale or a rider to the contract) to repair, remediate and/or replace: (1) <strong>any</strong> of the items or issues contained in any inspection report, or (2) <strong>any</strong> items or issues that you could have or should have discovered (whether or not contained in an inspection report, even where you have elected to waive your right to inspect the Premises), you will be required to take title to the Premises in its “as is” condition<strong> without recourse</strong> to the Seller for any such physical conditions, issues or items existing at the Premises.</em></p>
<p>However, in the event new issues, which did not exist at the time the Premises was inspected or at the time the contract was entered into, arise between the contract date and the closing date (the “Contract Period”) then a seller would be required to remedy same, provided it can be established by sufficient and objective proof that such condition did in fact arise within the Contract Period and not prior to the effective date of the contract or prior to the inspection. However, if there was no inspection conducted and no inspection report is available then it will be almost impossible to establish that the issue is new and the Purchaser will likely be required to accept the premises in its “as is” condition at closing.</p>
<p><strong>The Unforeseen Consequences and Liabilities</strong></p>
<p>Market conditions will sometimes force individuals to do things that they ordinarily would not do. Buyers, sellers, real estate agents and attorneys must be informed of all of the potential risks involved when waivers of important and critical contingencies are contemplated. While it is not recommended that buyers waive important contingencies, it is critical that they are aware of the pitfalls and risks associated with such waivers, and they make a knowledgeable and informed decision. Attorneys and real estate agents should never be in a position where they are recommending that an individual waives any contingencies, however, once they have made their recommendations against these waivers and have provided the client with the necessary information, the ultimate decision will be the purchaser’s.</p>

The Northeast’s annual sales rate now stands at 680,000, which is 9.3% lower as compared to May 2021. The median single-family sale price in the Northeast in May was $409,700, a 6.7% rise from one year ago.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—U.S. Existing-home sales retreated for the fourth consecutive month in May, the National Association of Realtors announced today (June 21). Month-over-month sales declined in three out of four major U.S. regions, while year-over-year sales slipped in all four regions.</p>
<p>The Northeast was the outlier with a 1.5% increase in single-family home sales in May. The Northeast’s annual sales rate now stands at 680,000, which is 9.3% lower as compared to May 2021. The median single-family sale price in the Northeast in May was $409,700, a 6.7% rise from one year ago.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, fell 3.4% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million in May. Year-over-year, sales receded 8.6% (5.92 million in May 2021).</p>
<p>“Home sales have essentially returned to the levels seen in 2019—prior to the pandemic—after two years of gangbuster performance,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Also, the market movements of single-family and condominium sales are nearly equal, possibly implying that the preference towards suburban living over city life that had been present over the past two years is fading with a return to pre-pandemic conditions.”</p>
<p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of May was 1,160,000 units, an increase of 12.6% from April and a 4.1% decline from the previous year (1.21 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.2 months in April and 2.5 months in May 2021.</p>
<p>“Further sales declines should be expected in the upcoming months given housing affordability challenges from the sharp rise in mortgage rates this year,” Yun added. “Nonetheless, homes priced appropriately are selling quickly and inventory levels still need to rise substantially—almost doubling—to cool home price appreciation and provide more options for home buyers.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in May was $407,600, up 14.8% from May 2021 ($355,000), as prices increased in all regions. This marks 123 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 16 days in May, down from 17 days in April and 17 days in May 2021. Eighty-eight percent of homes sold in May 2022 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 27% of sales in May, down from 28% in April and down from 31% in May 2021. NAR’s 2021 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in late 2021—reported that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions in May, down from 26% in April and up from 23% recorded in May 2021.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in May, down from 17% in April and 17% in May 2021.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in May, essentially unchanged from April 2022 and May 2021.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23% in May, up from 4.98% in April. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.</p>
<p>Realtor.com&#8217;s Market Trends Report in May showed that the largest year-over-year median list price growth occurred in Miami (+45.9%), Nashville (+32.5%), and Orlando (+32.4%). Austin reported the highest growth in the share of homes that had their prices reduced compared to last year (+14.7 percentage points), followed by Las Vegas (+12.3 percentage points) and Phoenix (+11.6 percentage points).</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.80 million in May, down 3.6% from 4.98 million in April and down 7.7% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $414,200 in May, up 14.6% from May 2021.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 units in May, down 1.6% from April and down 15.3% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $355,700 in May, an annual increase of 14.8%.</p>
<p>“Declining home purchases means more people are renting, and the resulting rent price escalation may spur more institutional investors to buy single-family homes and turn them into rental properties—placing additional financial strain on prospective first-time homebuyers,” said NAR President Leslie Rouda Smith, a Realtor from Plano, TX, and a broker associate at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate in Dallas. “To counter this trend, policymakers should consider incentivizing an inventory release to the market by temporarily lowering capital gains taxes for mom-and-pop investors to sell to first-time buyers.”</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Midwest dropped 5.3% from the previous month to an annual rate of 1,240,000 in May, slumping 7.5% from May 2021. The median price in the Midwest was $294,500, up 9.5% from one year before.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South declined 2.8% in May to an annual rate of 2,410,000, down 8.4% from the previous year. The median price in the South was $375,000, a 20.6% jump from one year ago. For the ninth consecutive month, the South recorded the highest pace of price appreciation in comparison to the other three regions.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West slid 5.3% compared to the month before to an annual rate of 1,080,000 in May, down 10.0% from this time last year. The median price in the West was $633,800, an increase of 13.3% from May 2021.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—With a backdrop of rising interest rates, slowing buying demand, high inflation and a turbulent stock market, some industry observers are questioning the strength of the residential sales market and forecasting hard times ahead.</p>
<p>With the recent 0.75% increase in the short-term benchmark lending rate by the Federal Reserve to try and tame high inflation and with more rate hikes expected in the months ahead, a dark cloud hovers over the residential sales market. The rate increases are an attempt to control inflation, which in May stood at 8.6%, the highest level since December 1981.</p>
<p>NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun released a statement in reaction to the Federal Reserve’s rate increase that clearly predicted a slowdown in the home sales market.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement by the Federal Reserve set a big increase in interest rates and means several more rounds of rate hikes are on the way in upcoming months. So far, the short-term fed funds rate that the Fed directly controls has risen by 175 basis points. But the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has risen even more—by nearly 300 basis points. On the same $300,000 mortgage, the monthly payment has risen from $1,265 in December to $1,800 today. That’s painful and, consequently, will shrink the buyer pool,” Yun said.</p>
<p>He continued, “Home sales have recently been trending down towards 2019 figures. Sales could fall even further with some inventory sitting on the market for more than a month like in the pre-pandemic days. Pricing a listed home properly will, therefore, be the key to attracting buyers. In the meantime, rental demand will strengthen along with rents. Only when consumer price inflation tops out and starts to fall will mortgage rates stabilize or even decline a bit. That is why providing additional oil supplies will be critical in containing consumer prices and interest rates.”</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> decided to reach out to some prominent Realtors in the region to learn their views on current conditions and where they see the market going forward. The consensus is that in all areas and all price points, activity is down, but conditions still remain strong.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, Chief Creative Officer of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, said that people make a mistake comparing 2022 activity to 2021 or even 2020 because the latter were two of the best years in the history of the market. He contended that a better comparison is with 2019, which was still a pretty good year but not supercharged by impacts of the coronavirus,</p>
<p>“Compared to 2019, year-to-date 2022 we’re up between 10% to 20% in sales in every regional county, and up more than 30% in the regional average sales price,” Rand said. “If you’re a real estate professional, that’s probably a 50% increase in volume, which is how we earn our living.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Rand stressed that while sales will be down, the market will still be strong on a historical basis. “I expect that both the increase in rates and the instability in the economy is going to drive sales down, well below the last two years and probably close to the last ‘normal’ year of 2019. But, I still think we’ll have moderate price appreciation for the year, nothing like the double-digit appreciation of the last two years but more like 6% to 7% for the region. That’s not bad!” he said.</p>
<p>HGAR President-Elect Tony D’Anzica said that recently he has definitely seen a slowdown in activity. The Broker/Owner of Dynamax Realty NYC, Inc., which operates in New York City and Central New York, said, “I do see the markets slowing down (in both New York City and upstate) and I am starting to see price decreases and I am starting to see people listing their homes for market value, whereas six months ago, eight months ago, a year ago, I saw sellers wanting to list their homes for astronomical prices that the market could not bear.”</p>
<p>D&#8217;Anzica said that he is seeing a slowdown, but characterized conditions as still a “seller’s market.” However, he expects that will last for another six to 12 months. He added that he is starting to see some buyer nervousness with the rising lending rates, but that at present with still low inventory, there are still enough buyers in the market to absorb the available listings.</p>
<p>Carmen Bauman, HGAR Treasurer and Principal Broker of Green Grass Realty Corp. of Bronxville, said that there is a natural slowdown in activity in the summer months and inventory remains low in her market area in the New Rochelle-Bronxville region. “I have noticed that buyers have a little more leverage due to the rising interest rates, but that is dependent on pricing,” Bauman said.</p>
<p>She added that homes priced over $1 million are still seeing significant buyer interest, while homes priced under $1 million are being impacted somewhat since buyers for those homes are more affected by rising interest rates. Bauman said that owners of homes that do not sell after their first or second open house are now reducing prices to spur activity. While she sees a slowdown, Bauman does not see any indication of any type of collapse in 2022 or 2023.</p>
<p>Charlie Oppler, Co-Broker/Owner and CEO of Prominent Properties Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty of Franklin Lakes, NJ, said that in his market areas of Northern New Jersey and Rockland County there has been a slowdown in unit sales due to a number of factors, including inflation, high interest rates and low inventory. Sales prices have leveled off in some markets, but have increased in some cases by double-digits in popular locations.</p>
<p>The 2021 NAR President said that demand is still high, but not at the frenzied pace of 2020 and 2021. “You may not see 20 offers on a property, now you will see six,” he said. “But, I think that is a function of interest rates and inflation.”</p>
<p>Oppler is bullish on the market going forward despite the current headwinds. “I am not worried about a collapse,” he told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. “The reason is because if you look at 2008 to 2013 you had no-income verification loans, stated income, a lot of mortgages that were not counting on appreciation to cover the buyer. This marketplace the last three, four or five years, we have not seen a huge increase in the mortgage amount, we are seeing a lot more cash down on the big purchases and or just straight-out cash purchases, which means that the buyer can hold onto their property.”</p>
<p>The rise in interest rates are going to impact first-time buyers and price some out of the market. “That is where the big challenge will be,” Oppler said.</p>
<p>HGAR President Anthony Domathoti said that while activity has slowed down, there is no indication of any market collapse. “In my region as a whole, I would not say there has been a decline, but a slowdown because of the lack of inventory and rising interest rates.&#8221; The Broker-Owner of EXIT Realty Premium added that some buyers are a little careful before they make the decision to enter the market.</p>
<p>Dorothy Botsoe, President and CEO of Dorothy Jensen Realty, Inc. of White Plains, said that the foreclosure/distressed property market is picking up due to the expiration of COVID eviction moratoriums. However, the conventional home sales market, particularly the first-time-buyer segment, is slowing down.</p>
<p>“The buyers are taking a breath,” she said. “They are thinking before they jump and give that over-priced offer.” Botsoe said that rising interest rates have priced some first-time home buyers out of the market. She said that higher lending rates have definitely given some prospective homebuyers pause before they make an offer.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—More than a year ago, Genting Americas, the parent company of Resorts World Catskills casino in Monticello, presented plans to the Newburgh Town Board to locate a Video Gaming Machine facility at the Newburgh Mall in eastern Orange County.</p>
<p>The new plan was proposed after Genting scrapped an earlier proposal to build a VGM facility at the former Nepera Chemical plant property in Harriman.</p>
<p>After securing all approvals, construction began on the Resorts World Hudson Valley project in Newburgh. Earlier this month, Genting officials briefed <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> on a tour of the project, which is now under construction. The $32-million project cost has now increased to approximately $50 million and involves the conversion of 90,000 square feet of space, including the now vacant Bon Ton Department store into the VGM facility that would feature approximately 1,300 VGMs and Resort World’s signature lounge—Bar 360.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-41357" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JVP_0038.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />The proposed VGM facility at the 388,000 square foot Newburgh Mall that is located at the crossroads of Interstates 84 and 87 at the intersection of Route 300, would be leased from the mall property owner.</p>
<p>During the recent tour and briefing, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> spoke with Darlene Monzo, Chief Marketing Officer, Genting America’s East to learn the status of the development, its projected opening and how its operations will complement its existing fully-licensed casino in Monticello (Resorts World Catskills) and its huge VGM facility in Queens at Aqueduct Racetrack—Resorts World New York City. Other Genting representatives on the tour were: Meghan Taylor, VP Government Affairs &amp; Public Relations, Genting New York and Anthony Bruno, VP Operations, Resorts World Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>New York State is in the midst of a process to award up to three full downstate casino gaming licenses and Genting’s Resorts World New York City is in the running for one of those licenses, along with Empire City in Yonkers and others.</p>
<p>This month, Genting’s Monzo, a more than 30-year veteran of the gaming industry, answers<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em>’s “Five Questions.”</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Can you tell us when the Newburgh gaming facility (Resorts World Hudson Valley) will open? How many construction workers is it employing now and how many gaming workers will it employ when operational? Also, what market areas are you hoping to tap with this new gaming property?</p>
<p><strong>Monzo:</strong> Okay, let’s start with the opening. We are super excited. We will be opening in the late fall of this year. As far as employees go, we will have about 300 team members (upon opening). Currently, we are employing about 200 construction workers in different trades.</p>
<p>In terms of market areas, Genting is really about diversity. In the United States we have a big property in Las Vegas, which is definitely a destination. The same right here in New York, it is really a triangle effect. So, if you are really dreaming about slots, we have about 6,500 slots in New York City (Resorts World New York City at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens). Up at Resorts World Catskills it’s a destination property but really high-end. We can deal to the real premium players. And at Resorts World Hudson Valley (in Newburgh) we are really looking for that local (customer). The person that may want to drive an hour; wants to stay for two hours and play and to have a nice cocktail and bet on a sports bet. That’s what we are looking for in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> I believe Resorts World Catskills had its best month in its history in April 2022 with nearly $20.2 million in Gross Gaming Revenue. Is Resorts World Catskills now operating on a profit or is it still losing money?</p>
<p><strong>Monzo:</strong> We are operating at a profit. The property is doing very well. I would contribute hotel occupancy and gaming to a big portion of that. Last year, if you look at the stats, we had lower occupancy rates in both the Alder and in the main tower. Folks when they come and they play for two or three days, the gaming value increases. Also, we have enlarged our food and beverage portfolio. So, just for Memorial Day weekend we just opened Dos Gatos and Las Luces, so outside, you can play games, get cocktails and get a great taco.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-41359" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JVP_0084.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />So, we really enlarged the attraction. The age demographic is much larger. We have younger folks coming up in their 30’s that are playing, as well as maintaining our senior base as well.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Can you break down the demographics of the typical Resorts World Catskills patron. Where are most of your clientele coming from?</p>
<p><strong>Monzo:</strong> The majority come from New York (State). We do have a large cross-over with Northern New Jersey, Pennsylvania and from Connecticut as well. We have definitely increased the Northern New Jersey market (share)—Bergen County and Passaic County. In New York, Sullivan County and Orange County are really big markets for us.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The New York State Gaming Commission has begun the process of awarding three downstate casino licenses in the New York metro region. If Resorts World Casino New York City wins one of those licenses, would there be a significant investment in that property at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens and can you quantify that investment at all?</p>
<p><strong>Monzo:</strong> It is a bit early to quantify the investment, but I can tell you that Genting came to New York City and has a huge commitment to New York City and yes, there would be an expansion in the total footprint in every aspect. So, they are super excited about it. We have a large footprint on our third floor (at Resorts World New York City) that would get us fast to market, which would be important to New York State and the taxpayers because we can be very, very quick as opposed to someone new that would come in and be under construction for five to seven years to build a facility like that. So, yes, immediately on our third floor and then long-term we have a full footprint master plan that we would be ready to present with our RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The RFP for a downstate gaming facility is due in October 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Finally, whether Resorts World Casino New York City wins the license or not, there will eventually be three new downstate casinos awarded. How will that impact Resorts World Catskills which I imagine is seeing some business from downstate patrons.?</p>
<p><strong>Monzo:</strong> When you talked about (Resorts World) Catskills growing the business, a lot of that came from our New York City property in growing the market share as opposed to feeding off of the casino down in New York City. With the synergies that we will have with the three properties (Monticello, Newburgh and Queens) it helps us to create loyalty. If you play at one property you may get bigger rewards at another property.</p>
<p>I am super excited about this property (Resorts World Hudson Valley in Newburgh). I think it is going to do extremely well. I think we will wind up growing the Orange County-Sullivan County business because I think we can give more to the patron, more variety. If you want to go away for the weekend, you are going to the Catskills. If you want to stay local, you are thinking Resorts World (Hudson Valley)…<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-41358" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JVP_0054.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="237" /></p>
<p>This facility will complement Resorts World Catskills, because, when you go to a destination market you may only be going once a weekend per month and you may not want to take an hour and 20-minute drive there. You may want to take a 15-minute drive and to go and play for a few hours versus needing an extra day off for a long weekend.</p>
<p>So, I do think they will complement each other where we will win—all of us. If you want to go and play slots and you got a Hyatt Rewards, you go to New York City. If you want to go fishing and then hit the casino… and play golf, the Monster golf course will be opening up in 2023 (at Resorts Catskills in Monticello) and that is going to be very impressive.</p>
<p>At Resorts World Catskills we have the Sports Book and anywhere in New York you can bet with Resorts World Bet and that is going extremely well. We are going to make sure that the sports bettors are really comfortable at the bar here (at the Newburgh property) and we are branding it Resorts World Bet so that will be fun as well.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Anthony Cutugno, Sr. Vice President, Director of Private Brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence, said that there have been material changes in market conditions in the past few weeks that will impact the Westchester County luxury market for the rest of this year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The luxury market in Westchester County continues to be strong based on current sales data, however, officials with Houlihan Lawrence tell <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the volatile stock market, rising interest rates and inflation are bound to bring about some changes in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>Anthony Cutugno, Sr. Vice President, Director of Private Brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence, said that there have been material changes in market conditions in the past few weeks that will impact the Westchester County luxury market for the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Gay Prizio, director of Project Marketing at Houlihan Lawrence, said that as of June 16, luxury home sales (priced at $2 million or more) were up 9.5% from the second quarter of 2021, which she said: “was very respectable.” Both Prizio and Cutugno noted that the sales percentage could increase or decrease prior to the end of the month as the company prepares its official second quarter 2022 report.</p>
<p>The current data reflects sales activity from earlier this year when the stock market was booming and lending rates were much lower. In the first quarter of this year, Westchester registered 99 luxury home sales, an increase of 17.9% from the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The median sale price of a Westchester luxury home ($2 million or higher) at the end of the first quarter of 2002 was $2.75 million, up 3.4% from the same period in 2021. The price per-square-foot in the first quarter of this year rose 9.5% to $578. The average days on market stood at 86, down 19.6% from the first quarter of 2021, according to Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>The current Days on Market (as of June 16) has dropped dramatically, down 50% as compared to the second quarter of last year, Prizio said. The percent sale to list price is currently 103%. At the end of the first quarter of this year, that rate stood at 98.4%.</p>
<p>“These statistics point to a very strong market on paper, but what we are seeing now is the market does feel like there is a shift going on,” Prizio said.</p>
<p>Cutugno added, “Our second quarter numbers are going to look very good, but that is reflective of first quarter sales and first quarter pendings. And, as we are moving into the second quarter and into the third quarter, we think and we are anticipating that is where we are going to see the statistical shift because there is just such a delay in the data.”</p>
<p>He said the events of the last several weeks with inflation at 8.6%, lending rates approaching 6% and dramatic declines in stock value have had a psychological effect on luxury home buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>“We are getting more calls for listings than we have had in a long time,” Cutugno said. “We are very busy meeting with sellers and reducing prices on properties that obviously didn’t trade during what has been the best two years that we have ever really seen.”</p>
<p>He noted that in the previous three days, there had been 26 reductions in prices on homes priced at $1 million or more in Westchester County. Prizio said that price reductions in the luxury market in Westchester have been rare and the recent volume of price reductions have been the most seen by the brokerage firm in a long time.</p>
<p>Cutugno related that the recent spike in new listings in the luxury market may be a case of some property owners questioning whether they missed the boom market.</p>
<p>The rather new market conditions are also causing luxury deals that were pending fall apart due to a number of reasons, including the higher cost of financing, he added.</p>
<p>The current economic climate is causing at least some sellers to be nervous.</p>
<p>Cutugno said that it is too early to tell how the luxury market in Westchester will perform in the third and fourth quarters, but noted that there is no cause for panic at this time.</p>
<p>“I think quite frankly that we are very happy to have listing calls because we have been so desperate for new listings,” he said. “Our basket is empty and quite frankly we were so fortunate. The one thing that COVID did for our luxury market was absorb the inventory that was out there. Now, we are happy to be getting these calls to have new properties to promote and we hope that we will continue to sell them.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Preparing and executing a listing agreement is common for many agents; almost too common. Because agents are used to the process, because they are excited to get a listing, and because they are anxious to get the property on the market, sometimes things are overlooked. It’s important that you take your time to ensure that a listing agreement is property filled out and executed. Here are some tips for your review.</p>
<p><strong>All Owners to Sign Listing Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Based on DOS opinion, in executing a listing agreement, an agent should verify ownership of a property and ensure that all parties needed to transfer title sign the listing agreement. Without approval of all parties to list the property, you cannot sell/transfer title. This becomes critical in the situation of a divorce and/or after the death of an owner. If both married parties own the property and only one party signs the listing agreement, the other can refuse to sell. Similarly, in the situation where a homeowner passes away, you need to ensure that the person listing the property is authorized to sell/transfer title. This person will be designated in a will and/or by the court (an executor/executrix or administrator), so ensure that the party listing the property has all the correct and authorizing paperwork before listing the property.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed by cooperating brokers and the public that the agent has full authority, permission, and cooperation of all owners in the sale of the entire property. If you fail to get all the owners to agree to list the property, technically an agent can only market and sell the share of the property the signer of the listing agreement owns; meaning that if the agent is marketing that they are selling the entire property and they cannot, this could expose the agent to civil and criminal liability, violation of DOS regulations (incompetence and misleading advertising), and the Code of Ethics. Additionally, there may also be a claim by the buyer/tenant’s agent for the cooperating commission against the listing broker. In short, all the parties who are required to transfer the property must sign the listing agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Compensation</strong></p>
<p>The DOS provided an opinion regarding Standard of Practice 16-16, stating: “&#8230;it is the seller, not the real estate broker, who has the right to establish the amount and terms of compensation offered to cobrokers, subagents or buyer’s agents.” Further, NYSAR has indicated that brokers should not have their own policies as to compensation and they should not implement an “office policy” as to compensation being offered to cooperating brokers.</p>
<p>All compensation must be consented upon by the seller. Such compensation, whether to the listing broker or to the cooperating agent, must be clearly stated, in writing and should set forth who from the cooperating side will be compensated (buyer’s agent, broker’s agent, seller’s agent, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Showings</strong></p>
<p>Similar to compensation, it is only the homeowner that establishes the terms of showings. Showing requirements can be wide open or very restrictive; however, those requirements can only be established by the homeowner and they must be in writing, so it is wise to obtain them when the listing agreement is executed (they can even be included in the listing agreement). These requirements can only be modified by the homeowner. Such requirements can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring the listing broker to be present at all showings.</li>
<li>Requiring the showing of identification of all individuals entering the home.</li>
<li>Requiring prequalification (Note: while a homeowner can request preapproval by a specific lender of their choosing, they cannot require that this specific lender be used in the transaction).</li>
<li>The refusal to permit specific buyers from viewing the property (so long as its non-discriminatory).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that, per a DOS opinion, a homeowner cannot refuse access to a specific buyer’s agent unless there is a documented history of problems with that agent (i.e., police report, DOS complaint, ethics complaint, etc.). Further, while collecting the names of prospective buyers may assist the listing agent, the request to collect the names must come from the homeowner, not the agent, as collection of such names are based upon the homeowner’s interests only. Lastly, be reminded that state-required Standard Operating Procedures are not applicable to listing agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Office Exclusives and ‘Coming Soon’</strong></p>
<p>Listing Agreement should include written approvals/waivers relating to MLS exposure. Such approval and/or waivers pertain to Office Exclusives and “Coming Soon” situations. For Office Exclusives, all listing agreements must be accompanied with a waiver from the homeowner that the property will not be placed on the MLS. For “Coming Soon” listings, the homeowner must affirm that the listing will go active on a date certain, but prior to that date it will receive limited marketing and no showing will be permitted. Once the listing goes live, the property will be widely marketed and will be fully available for showings.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions/Limitations of Offers</strong></p>
<p>Homeowners can establish how offers are presented. This could mean how the offers are physically presented (i.e., in person, once a week, all at once, etc.) and whether they will permit the buyer’s agent to be present at that time. Again, such conditions must be in writing. Best practice is to establish these conditions at the time of the listing agreement being executed. Limits, such as minimum price for offers to be presented, certain unacceptable terms, and certain qualifying terms must all be in writing.</p>
<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Remember to completely fill in all areas on a “fill-in-the-blank” listing agreement. If something is left blank, draw a line or an “X” through that section and have your homeowner initial it. Keep in mind that unless you are an attorney, you should not be modifying prepared contracts beyond filling in necessary information.</p>
<p>Additionally, be reminded that certain conditions/language must be included or cannot be included in NY listing agreements. For instance, 19 NYCRR§175.15 requires that no listing agreement can be automatically renewed. Also, the Commission Escrow Act requires that specific language be included in all listing agreements relating to how commission deposits and disputes are to be handled. OneKey MLS listing agreements contain language, among other things, that refer to the Home Equity Theft Protection Act, Equal Opportunity in Housing (19 NYCRR§175.24—relating to the prohibition on discrimination in real estate), as well as information relating to the Property Condition Disclosure Form and the inclusion of definitions for “exclusive right to sell” and “exclusive agency.”</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are listing a property on OneKey MLS, be reminded that as a Participant/Subscriber, you affirm that the materials you upload onto the MLS are not protected by any copyright and you are giving certain rights to the MLS. Make certain that this information is in the listing agreement. If the homeowner is not aware or does not agree to such rights being provided, the broker/agent may be held liable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Listing agreements are binding contracts and should be meticulously prepared. Make sure that you understand all parts and what they mean. Do not rush through them and make sure that you explain all the provisions to your client. If done properly, they are the foundation of a strong relationship.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—While the perfect storm of low inventory, rising interest rates and persistent inflation have certainly had their impact, the lower Hudson River Valley and greater New York City suburban real estate markets have continued to show remarkable resiliency in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Although the market has, in some instances, slowed compared to the over-heated market conditions of 2021, comparisons to the pre-pandemic market of 2019 show very stable conditions. Median sales numbers in the entire area continued to rise in the second quarter, still fueled by low inventory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-41466" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-Q2-6-County-Residential-Sales-1024x715.png" alt="" width="1024" height="715" /></p>
<p>In Westchester County second quarter single-family home sales of 1,583 declined 14.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021. However, when compared to the second quarter of 2019, single-family home sales in Westchester were up 5.5%. Condo sales in Westchester for the second quarter of 2022 were ahead of 2021 by 4.7% and co-op sales were even more robust, coming in 14.8% higher than the 2021 second quarter numbers. The single-family median sale price of $885,000 posted a 6% increase over last year, the condo median sale price of $450,000 was 11.1% higher than 2021, and the co-op median sale price of $203,000 was 6.8% higher than the previous year.</p>
<p>In Putnam County single-family home sales of 243 were down 19.8% compared to the second quarter of 2021, but when compared to 2019, the number of sales were identical. The median sales price of $480,000 was 8.6% higher than the second quarter of 2021. Rockland County experienced a steeper dip, with single family home sales down 22.8% and condo sales down 31.3%, however, when continuing the comparison to the second quarter of 2019, the 2022 second quarter numbers were slightly ahead. The single-family median sales price of $645,000 for the second quarter of 2022 in Rockland County was 17.3% higher than 2021.</p>
<p>In Orange County the second quarter single-family home sales number of 846 was down 12.3% over the 2021 second quarter, and the condo sales number of 119 was off 4.9%. The single-family home median sales price was up 15.3% at $415,000 and the median condo sales price of $275,000 for the second quarter was a 25% increase over the 2021 second quarter. In Sullivan County the single-family sales number of 273 was off 19% over the previous year, but was up more than 25% when compared to the second quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>Focusing closer to the city, the Bronx market continued to impress in the second quarter of 2022, with single-family home sales ahead 19.7% over the second quarter of 2021. The median sales price of $617,500 was 9.3% ahead of last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-41467" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-Q2-Median-Sales-Chart-1024x671.png" alt="" width="1024" height="671" /></p>
<p>There will continue to be challenges in comparing sales numbers to the pandemic year of 2020, when the market came to a grinding halt in the second quarter, and the post pandemic market of 2021, when pent up demand drastically sped up typical buying cycles.</p>
<p>In conclusion, one has to believe that the significant head winds of a declining stock market, rising inflation, rising interest rates, and the threat of a recession will continue to take their toll on the housing market. However, continued strong buyer demand, low inventory, and a strong labor market appear to be mitigating factors. Also, there have not been any significant price corrections given the current economic headwinds. Depending upon the length and depth of a recession (if there is one), the lower Hudson River Valley and greater New York City suburban real estate markets should continue to demonstrate stability going forward into 2022. So far, the housing market appears to be rising above the perfect storm. <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2022-2nd-Quarter-Report-Final.pdf">Click Here</a> to read the full report.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court in Albany County found the “Good Cause” Eviction Statute to be null and void. The Supreme Court in<em> Pusatere v. City of Albany</em> found that Albany’s Good Cause Eviction law (Local Law F of 2021 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Rt4yOa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Rt4yOa</a>]) was in direct conflict with and preempted by New York State law. The court’s decision is a major victory for landlords and property owners. The plaintiffs argued that Albany’s Good Cause Eviction law “attempts to regulate rental rates and tenant evictions at the local level, which is preempted by State law.” Even the name of the legislation, “Prohibition of Eviction Without Good Cause Law,” clearly evidences the existence of a conflict as there is no requirement under New York State law to establish “good cause” in order to evict a tenant.</p>
<p><strong>The Preemption Doctrine</strong></p>
<p>The Preemption Doctrine restricts local governments from enacting legislation that is inconsistent with the state’s Constitution or with any laws of the state. The court in <em>Pusatere</em> explains that there are two types of preemptions that apply to local laws “[1] conflict preemption, which prohibits a local government from adopting a law that is ‘inconsistent with’ state law, and [2] field preemption, which prohibits a local government from legislating in a field or area of the law where the ‘Legislature has assumed full regulatory responsibility.’” The court further explained that “…conflict preemption occurs when a local law prohibits what a state law explicitly allows.” If there exists no inconsistency or conflict, then the legislation would be valid, and the preemption doctrine would not apply. However, the court in Pusatere found that Local Law F of 2021 was in direct conflict with New York State’s Real Property Law (“RPL”) and Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (“RPAPL”).</p>
<p><strong>The Conflict with Albany’s Local Law F of 2021</strong></p>
<p>Section 30-327 Local Law F of 2021 provided that “No landlord shall, by action to evict or to recover possession, by exclusion from possession, by failure to renew any lease or otherwise, remove any tenant from housing accommodation except for good cause as defined in Section 328 of this article.” Section 30-328 further provides:</p>
<p><em>“A. No landlord shall remove a tenant from any housing accommodation, or attempt such removal or exclusion from possession, notwithstanding that the tenant has no written lease or that the lease or other rental agreement has expired or otherwise terminated, except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered in an appropriate judicial action or proceeding in which the petitioner or plaintiff has established one of the following grounds as good cause for removal or eviction:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) The tenant has failed to pay rent due and owing, provided, however, that the rent due and owing, or any part thereof, did not result from a rent increase or pattern of rent increases which, regardless of the tenant&#8217;s prior consent, if any, is unconscionable or imposed for the purpose of circumventing the intent of this article. In determining whether all or part of the rent due and owing is the result of an unconscionable rent increase or pattern of rent increases, the Court may consider, among other factors, i) the rate of the increase relative to the tenant’s ability to afford said increase, ii) improvements made to the subject unit or common areas serving said unit, iii) whether the increase was precipitated by the tenant engaging in the activity described at section 223-b (1(a)-(c) of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, iv) significant market changes relevant to the subject unit, and v) the condition of the unit or common areas serving the unit, and it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the rent for a dwelling not protected by rent regulation is unconscionable or imposed for the purpose of circumventing the intent of this article if said rent has been increased in any calendar year by a percentage exceeding five percent….”</em></p>
<p>The “Prohibition of Eviction Without Good Cause Law,” as the name of the legislation clearly intends, requires that a landlord must establish “good cause” as detailed in Section 30-328(A)(1) above in order to be able to evict a tenant, which is not a requirement of current New York law.</p>
<p><strong>The Rationale of the Court</strong></p>
<p>The judge in Pusatere pointed out that “[n]otably, there is nothing in the RPAPL that requires a landlord to show ‘good cause’ after a lease expires in order to be successful in a special proceeding to evict a tenant.” The judge further states that “To the contrary, RPAPL expressly permits eviction upon the mere showing that the terms of a tenant’s lease have expired.” The court points out that Local Law F not only added “good cause” requirements that did not exist under New York State law, it also restricted a landlord’s right to evict a tenant even where a lease had expired or there was no written lease. The judge pointed out that this was in direct conflict with the RPAPL.</p>
<p>The judge further explained that Local Law F was in direct conflict with Section 228 of the RPL. Under Section 228, a landlord is permitted to end a month-to-month tenancy on 30 days’ notice to the tenant. Again, the court points out that there is no requirement under Section 228 to “demonstrate good cause” in order for a landlord to terminate a tenancy. Additionally, under Section 226-c, a landlord may raise rents by 5% or more provided the tenant is given “adequate written notice” at the time of renewal for those tenants that have written leases, and upon “sufficient notice” for those tenants under month-to-month tenancies. Once again, the judge points out that under the current law “The landlord’s right to increase rent is not conditioned upon a showing of good cause.” Local Law F clearly conflicts with the RPL in that it “…allows a court to interfere with a landlord’s right to increase rent by determining ‘whether all or part of the rent due and owing is the result of unconscionable rent, increase or pattern of rent increases relative to the tenant’s ability to afford said increase.’” Local Law F adds additional requirements that clearly violate the doctrine of preemption.</p>
<p>The court ultimately held that since Sections 30-327 and 30-328 of Local Law F “altered substantive provisions and procedures of existing state law by imposing limitations and prerequisites to the commencement of an eviction proceeding that are not required under state law,” they were deemed null and void. The court further held that since the remaining provisions of Local Law F were enacted solely to support Sections 30-327 and 30-328, the entire law was held to be invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Other Municipalities and the Fate of Good Cause Legislation</strong></p>
<p>Other municipalities such as Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Beacon and Hudson have passed similar “good cause” eviction laws and their fate remains unknown at this time. Although, it is likely that each of these statutes may suffer a similar demise as the primary element of each of these laws is that “good cause” be established by landlords in order to be able to evict a tenant. According to <em>The Real Deal</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3NZbnEk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3NZbnEk</a>), before the Pusatere decision, tenant advocate groups were attempting to use a local, “incremental” approach to passing “good cause” legislation. However, with the decision in Pusatere, it is now likely that the “local” tactic will be abandoned and the push for the enactment of a statewide “good cause” eviction law will again be the focus of tenant advocate groups and progressive lawmakers. In 2021, the passage of a statewide “good cause eviction” in the legislature was not successful. Landlord and property owner advocates should now be prepared to counter those efforts on the state level.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The goal of the initiative announced late last month is to identify properties that have suitable infrastructure and regulatory approvals so the Partnership can market to industries best suited for those parcels.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—Terming it as one of the most important efforts it has launched in more than 20 years, The Orange County Partnership officially unveiled its “Site Inventory Program” (SIP) that will, over the coming months, seek municipal government input from across Orange County to determine all available properties that could be developed in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The goal of the initiative announced late last month is to identify properties that have suitable infrastructure and regulatory approvals so the Partnership can market to industries best suited for those parcels.</p>
<p>The Site Inventory Program was first announced at the Orange County Partnership’s MVP Annual Breakfast program held last month at The Barn at Villa Venezia in the Town of Wallkill. Orange County Partnership President and CEO, Maureen Halahan said the initiative will be headed by Conor Eckert, Senior Development Officer &amp; Vice President of Business Attraction and Kaitlynn Lancellotti, Director of Business Retention and Expansion for the Orange County Partnership.</p>
<p>The Site Inventory Program will seek to take advantage of some of Orange County’s key growth industries—food &amp; beverage processing, advanced manufacturing, clean energy and life sciences—that the Partnership believes will be investing and creating jobs in the county over the next two decades.</p>
<p>The Orange County Partnership held its first SIP session with the Town of Wallkill on June 22. Participants included Town Supervisor George Serrano along with town department heads that were able to provide information on suitable properties that are on and off-market, as well as their zoning, infrastructure, tax and regulatory approval requirements. The SIP’s focus is to secure information on properties that could accommodate new development of 20,000 square feet or more in communities across Orange County.</p>
<p>“I believe the Site Inventory Program is one of the most important endeavors the Partnership has launched in my more than 20 years with the organization,” Halahan said. “Information such as available infrastructure is key to attracting diverse industry. Knowledge is power and the Site Inventory Program will provide the intelligence we need to market sites to specific industry clusters. This program will clearly set Orange County apart from its competition.”</p>
<p>Eckert said that the Orange County Partnership believes that a diverse economy is key to the county’s future growth and sustainability. With that in mind, the Site Inventory Program “will reverse engineer the site selection process through visiting communities across the county and meeting with key leaders to gain expert understanding of sites, infrastructure, the timeline for approvals and we will be able to use this information to understand which sites and which communities can accommodate strategic sectors.”</p>
<p>Eckert stressed, “This is a way that we can have the answers to a prospect’s questions before they even ask. This program is pro-active not reactive and this will arm us with information so we can go out to site selectors and prospects and pitch sites because we know which communities have a site, the infrastructure and the political support for our growth sectors.”</p>
<p>Kaitlynn Lancellotti said the SIP will take a global look at the county and then undertake a “deep dive” into each municipality to see what each community wants in terms of new business development and where in their town, village or city they would welcome new business investment. “We are going to these meetings asking municipal leaders what their vision is for their commercially zoned priority growth corridors so that we can market accordingly to the desired industry sectors” Lancellotti said.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks and throughout the summer, the Orange County Partnership hopes to hold SIP sessions with various municipalities throughout Orange County.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The biotechnology company has committed to create at least 1,000 new full-time, high-skill jobs in the Mid-Hudson Region over the next five years. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TARRYTOWN—The largest business expansion project in the history of Westchester County became official on June 22.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul joined other state, county and local officials to celebrate the ceremonial groundbreaking of Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc.’s $1.8-billion expansion project at its corporate headquarters campus in Tarrytown/Greenburgh.</p>
<p>The biotechnology company has committed to create at least 1,000 new full-time, high-skill jobs in the Mid-Hudson region over the next five years.</p>
<p>Tarrytown serves as Regeneron&#8217;s corporate and research and development headquarters, and the expansion plan now underway includes the addition of new laboratories, preclinical manufacturing and process development suites and office space. The project will encompass the design, construction and fit out of up to eight buildings, three parking garages and a central utility plant totaling approximately 900,000 square feet.</p>
<p>New York State’s Empire State Development is supporting the project with up to $100 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits, consistent with the company&#8217;s hiring goals. Regeneron considered several potential sites in the tri-state area before deciding to expand in the Mid-Hudson region. The company has stated that it is also receiving incentives from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency and other sources totaling approximately $172.9 million.</p>
<p>“New York is a leader in the life sciences industry in part due to the decades of investment and many groundbreaking scientific advancements at Regeneron,” Gov. Hochul said. “The COVID-19 crisis was one demonstration of how quickly and effectively Regeneron is able to deploy its drug discovery and development engine against devastating diseases. Regeneron&#8217;s work has undoubtedly saved countless lives in New York and throughout the United States, and we are proud that Regeneron will continue to create good jobs and invest in the Mid-Hudson region as they work to make additional breakthroughs against blindness-causing diseases, cancer, genetic diseases and more.”</p>
<p>Regeneron President and Chief Executive Officer Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., said, “We have been a proud New York company since our beginning over three decades ago, during which time we have invented industry-leading drug discovery technology and developed 10 FDA-approved or authorized medicines entirely in our own laboratories. New York State has played an important role in our success by consistently recognizing the value of innovation, fostering an inclusive and dynamic biomedical industry, and helping to attract top talent to the region.”</p>
<p>Details of Regeneron Pharmaceutical’s expansion plans in Westchester were detailed in paperwork filed with the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency earlier this year in connection with incentives it was seeking for its investment at the Tarrytown complex.</p>
<p>The company has already begun construction on its Parcel D expansion project at its headquarters campus property in Greenburgh that is valued at $480 million. The Parcel D project involves the construction of a new two-story, 207,000-square-foot building, along with a parking structure and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>The firm now will also move forward with its $1.394-billion “Loop Road” project in the Town of Greenburgh involving the construction of eight new buildings, three parking garages and a central utility plant totaling approximately 724,000 square feet at 777 OId Saw Mill River Road. The development would be located on a portion of the 100 acres the company acquired for $72 million in 2015.</p>
<p>The Parcel D and Loop Road projects total approximately 921,000 square feet of space and a total investment of $1.87 billion.</p>
<p>The proposed Loop Road capital investment would serve to locate and staff multiple new R&amp;D laboratories, administrative buildings, and amenities. Regeneron, which currently employs more than 3,300 full time employees at its corporate headquarters facilities in Tarrytown, stated that the project would retain 250 jobs at its campus property in Greenburgh, Mount Pleasant and Tarrytown and add another 700 new jobs at the property.</p>
<p>The construction of the project will result in approximately 2,500 construction jobs. In connection with the project, a study commissioned by the Westchester County IDA estimates that the construction project would generate $208.8 million in direct spending in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer said, “Westchester County is proud to be home to New York&#8217;s largest biotech company—Regeneron. Regeneron is growing and shaping the future of the biopharmaceutical industry and in doing so is adding full-time and high-skill jobs. I thank Governor Kathy Hochul for her leadership and foresight in supporting the expansion with up to $100 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits. We all look forward to seeing what Regeneron will do next.”</p>
<p>Town of Greenburgh Supervisor Paul Feiner said, “The expansion of Regeneron&#8217;s campus is the most significant economic development project in the Town of Greenburgh&#8217;s history. Additionally, Regeneron is making significant breakthroughs and advancements in the field of life science and improving the lives of New Yorkers in the process.”</p>
<p>Town of Mount Pleasant Supervisor Carl Fulgenzi said, “The Town of Mount Pleasant is proud to have Regeneron as a major manufacturer and biotech facility in our town that has constantly and successfully expanded over the years offering many job opportunities and broadened our tax base. We look forward to their future growth and look forward to partnering with them for an even brighter future ahead.”</p>
<p>The project is expected to take place in two phases over six years, with construction expected to be completed in 2027. The direct and indirect fiscal benefit to state and local government is estimated to be more than $283.3 million, with a nearly $2 billion estimated economic benefit to New York State.</p>
<p>Regeneron was founded in 1988 in New York City; the following year, New York State invested $250,000 in the company. Today, Regeneron is the largest biotech company in New York State and one of the largest and most productive in the world.</p>

Westchester County netted a net gain of New York City residents of more than 15,000 l]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH, NY—A recently released study by regional research group Pattern for Progress found that media reports and sentiments of area Realtors of a significant exodus of New York City residents to the Hudson Valley were indeed accurate.</p>
<p>The Pattern for Progress study released on July 8 found that during 2020—the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic—the Hudson Valley enjoyed a net gain of 33,394 residents from the five boroughs of New York City. Westchester County netted a  gain of more than 15,000 New York City residents in 2020.</p>
<p>“Our analysis of migration during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic puts real data behind the fact that more people moved into the Hudson Valley in 2020,” Pattern CEO Adam Bosch said. “The county-by-county data outlined in our report are only part of the story, but they mark an important reversal in a trend that saw our region losing several thousand residents to migration every year for more than a decade.”</p>
<p>He continued, “Government, business, academic and nonprofit leaders across the region should try to understand the factors that will convince our new neighbors to stay in the Hudson Valley, and develop strategies that will help the region attract and retain more families in the years ahead.”</p>
<p>The report, “Moving In, Moving Out,” examined a new set of migration data released late this spring by the Internal Revenue Service. The data utilize information from tax returns to track domestic and international migration into the United States. Pattern officials stated that the IRS migration data are considered among the most accurate information for tracking the movement of people throughout the United States. The latest set of data tracks migration by analyzing address changes between tax returns in 2019 and 2020. It includes some returns that were processed through mid-July 2021 because of delays caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Pattern examined data from the nine-county region that includes Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester counties.</p>
<p>The following are key takeaways from the analysis:</p>
<p>• The nine-county region gained 105,716 people and lost 105,087 because of migration in 2019-2020, for a net gain of 629 people. That is not many, but the small increase is a noteworthy reversal of huge population losses across the Hudson Valley in preceding years. From 2016-2019, the region lost about 5,000 residents during each reporting period. It lost a whopping 7,255 people during the 2015-2016 period alone.</p>
<p>• The data confirms that thousands of people moved out of New York City and into the Hudson Valley during the first months of the pandemic. A total of 48,642 people from the five boroughs of New York City moved into the Hudson Valley, and 15,248 moved out of the region and into the city, for a net gain of 33,394 people in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>• The data show a north-south divide across the region. Counties in the lower Hudson Valley (Westchester, Rockland, Orange) lost population due to migration, while counties to the north showed net gains in population.</p>
<p>Conclusions are hard to draw because these data include migration before and during the pandemic, but the divide could indicate a movement away from densely populated areas into smaller cities, villages, and rural towns, the report stated. This trend was well documented in real estate data that showed people leaving high-population areas because they feared that density put them at a greater risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, the report stated.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-41613" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PATTERN-STUDY-CHART-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="633" />“The movement of people to and from the Hudson Valley is important to the future of our workforce, schools, housing and community vitality,” said Anthony Campagiorni, Chairperson of the Pattern Board of Directors. “Pattern has long provided analyses of demographic data so that our region can act on the basis of sound information. This report should help leaders across the region learn about those who moved into the region and inform our collective efforts to attract more residents here in the future.”</p>
<p>The report said that the coronavirus may prompt more New York City residents to consider the Hudson Valley. “The Hudson Valley has not seen a net-increase in migration since the few years that followed the terrorist attacks of 9/11. That inflow was driven by people who moved into the region from New York City, but generally continued their commute to jobs in the<br />
city. That trend lasted for two to four years, after which migration shifted back to New York City.”</p>
<p>The Pattern report noted that this time migration trends could be different. “Work-from-home software is better and more common than it was in 2001. And discussions with regional leaders suggest that this new wave of residents are more attracted to the Hudson Valley&#8217;s small cities and villages than the wave that came 20 years ago. The region should be engaged in a discussion with our new neighbors to understand what they enjoy about the Hudson Valley, the services that are lacking, and what we might do to keep them here,” the report stated.</p>
<p>The top three counties for net migration population growth from New York City were Westchester County at 15,405, Dutchess County at 4,955, followed by Orange County at 4,064. The remainder of the Hudson Valley all posted positive net migration from New York City: Rockland County at 3,439, Ulster County at 1,953, Sullivan County at 1,204, Putnam at 978, Columbia at 957 and Greene at 439.</p>
<p>A full analysis of the regional, county-by-county, and New York City trends can be found by accessing the report on Pattern’s website at https://www.pattern-for-progress.org. The report was made possible by local governments, businesses, utilities, nonprofits and academic institutions that support Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress.</p>
<p>Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress is a policy, planning, advocacy and research organization founded in 1965. It serves a nine-county region that includes Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester counties.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—If Realtors are feeling a sense of deja vu when it comes to current home sales activity, perhaps they are recalling how conditions were back in 2018 and 2019, which were both considered strong markets at the time.</p>
<p>However, the boom market of 2021, with surging sales and soaring prices throughout the region, has markedly changed in 2022. Realtors blame rising interest rates, a turbulent Wall Street and a 9.1% inflation rate—the highest rate of inflation in more than four decades—as chief reasons behind the drop-off in activity.</p>
<p>The residential market in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area, with the exception of the Bronx, saw sharp declines in sales transactions in the second quarter, most posting overall double-digit declines in volume, according to the<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2022-2nd-Quarter-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> second quarter home sales report</strong> </a>released earlier this month by OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>While sales volume is down in the Hudson Valley counties, median sale prices continued to climb, fueled in large part by the low inventory of homes on the market. In Westchester County, the second quarter single-family home sales of 1,583 declined 14.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021. However, when compared to the second quarter of 2019, single-family home sales in Westchester were up 5.5%. Condo sales in Westchester for the second quarter of 2022 were ahead of 2021 by 4.7% and co-op sales came in 14.8% higher than the 2021 second quarter numbers. The single-family median sale price of $885,000 was 6% higher than last year, the condo median sale price of $450,000 was 11.1% higher than 2021, and the co-op median sale price of $203,000 was 6.8% higher than the previous year.</p>
<p>In Putnam County, single-family home sales of 243 were down 19.8% compared to the second quarter of 2021, but when compared to 2019, the number of sales were identical. The median sales price of $480,000 was 8.6% higher than the second quarter of 2021. Rockland County experienced a steeper fall-off, with single family home sales down 22.8% and condo sales lower by 31.3%, however, when compared to the second quarter of 2019, the 2022 second quarter numbers were slightly ahead. The single-family median sales price of $645,000 for the second quarter of 2022 in Rockland County was 17.3% higher than 2021.</p>
<p>In Orange County, the second quarter single-family home sales number of 846 was down 12.3% over the 2021 second quarter, and the condo sales number of 119 was off 4.9%. The single-family home median sales price was up 15.3% at $415,000 and the median condo sales price of $275,000 for the second quarter was a 25% increase over the 2021 second quarter. In Sullivan County the single-family sales number of 273 was off 19% over the previous year but was up more than 25% when compared to the second quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>The Bronx market was the outlier in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors market area in the second quarter of 2022 with overall sales up 6% from 12 months earlier. Single-family home sales increased 19.7% over the second quarter of 2021. The median sales price of $617,500 was 9.3% ahead of last year.</p>
<p>HGAR President Anthony Domathoti said that the Federal Reserve’s push to raise rates to control inflation has impacted the overall market. Domathoti, who is Broker/Owner of EXIT Realty Premium in the Bronx, said that some first-time homebuyers are being priced out of the market.</p>
<p>He also noted that contract retractions are on the rise because buyers monthly payments have increased to unaffordable levels. Domathoti advised buyers to persevere and that conditions will eventually return to a more normal market.</p>
<p>When asked about why the Bronx is outperforming neighboring suburban markets, Domathoti said, “The Bronx is literally on fire,” noting that foreign investment has fueled the strong sales activity in the Bronx and he doesn’t see any major let-up going forward.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer and managing partner at Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, said the second quarter homes sales numbers in the Hudson Valley “tell a clear story of a seller’s market cooling, chilled by a surge in interest rates and increasingly skeptical buyers scared off by what two years of double-digit appreciation have done to pricing in the region.”</p>
<p>Rand echoed sentiments by OneKey MLS that the current market is still strong, and is comparable to the sales volume posted in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>“The seller’s market might be fading, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to see an immediate shift to a buyer’s market,” Rand noted. “Indeed, we see several signs that the market might just be returning to a more normal, balanced state following an abnormally large two-year tidal wave of activity following the end of lockdown restrictions, a surge in pandemic-driven urban to suburban migration and the desire to lock in what were at the time historically-low interest rates.”</p>
<p>In terms of where he sees the home sales market going forward, he expects activity will track near 2019 levels. “As for prices, we believe that we won’t see double-digit price appreciation again this year, but expect that low inventory will continue to drive meaningful price increases through the rest of the year and into 2023,” Rand predicts.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence in its second quarter reports pointed to low inventory as a key issue in the current market.</p>
<p>“The supply and demand ratio at every price point has remained unsustainably high for several years. Inventory levels are expected to rise slowly, but right now remain historically low. Paired with current demand, prices should endure. Uncertainty in the economy, however, has caused buyers to be more cautious and discerning. As a result, sellers will have to pay close attention to pricing,” said Liz Nunan, president and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>The region’s luxury market has slowed as well and a closer look indicates that rising rates are having an impact, according to Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>“Rising mortgage rates impact the decision to stay or move. The luxury buyer has the resources to absorb higher payments, however many would-be buyers who recently refinanced or purchased at a 3% mortgage are reluctant to trade their existing home and assume a significantly higher mortgage on a new purchase. Should their desire for a new home be stronger than practical implications, many don’t want to compete in such a supply-constrained market,” said Anthony P. Cutugno, senior vice president and director of private brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>He added that there are other factors that are causing some luxury buyers to stay on the sidelines at the moment. “Most new buyers want to put their personal mark on a new home, but material delays, supply chain issues and labor shortages keep homeowners out of the market,” Cutugno noted. “Low supply translates into competition, and sellers still have the upper hand. However, a sense of discipline has returned to the market as buyers contend with rising interest rates, stock market volatility and record high inflation.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[To provide some perspective, Real Estate In-Depth turned to the National Association of Realtors, specifically Nadia Evangelou, senior economist & director of forecasting, to answer “Five Questions” on the health and prospects of the residential and commercial markets this year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With the Federal Reserve poised to ratchet up short-term rates by 75 to as much as 100 basis points later this month and inflation currently at a four-decade high of 9.1%, fears in the investment and real estate communities are that a recession could be on the horizon.</p>
<p>While the current economy differs widely from the last recession in 2007-2008 as this economy has strong consumer demand and low unemployment, rising costs that are causing the Fed’s quick intervention is of great concern.</p>
<p>As housing activity has slowed, affordability has declined sharply in 2022. The National Association of Realtors reported recently its housing-affordability index fell to 102.5 in May, which was the lowest level since the index dropped to 100.5 in July 2006. All indications are that conditions will go from bad to worse for many first time homebuyers this year and into 2023.</p>
<p>Recent economic data prompted economists with the National Association of Home Builders earlier this month to forecast that rising inflation and higher interest rates will be key factors leading the U.S. into a “modest economic recession” next year.</p>
<p>In its bi-weekly e-newsletter Eye on the Economy, the NAHB Economics Group stated, “We foresee a modest economic recession in mid-2023 given tightening financial conditions and increased economic uncertainty. Higher interest rates will undoubtedly slow housing and business investment, acting as a drag on economic growth.” The NAHB Economics Group headed by Chief Economist Robert Dietz added that the U.S. unemployment rate is expected to rise from near cycle lows to above 5% in 2023, “while broader-based inflation will ease further as the economy slows.”</p>
<p>To provide some perspective, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> turned to the National Association of Realtors, specifically Nadia Evangelou, senior economist &amp; director of forecasting, to answer “Five Questions” on the health and prospects of the residential and commercial markets this year.</p>
<p>Evangelou focuses on regional and local market trends including the effects of changing demographic and migration patterns to forecast housing activity. She has been involved in research and analysis about local housing affordability conditions and local solutions to increase housing inventory. She also studies the effects of federal policies on the real estate market for NAR. Evangelou holds a master’s degree in Applied Economics from Johns Hopkins University, as well as advanced degrees in International European Economics and Public Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With the June inflation rate at the highest level in four decades, what impacts will this have on the residential and commercial markets going forward?</p>
<p><strong>Evangelou:</strong> We see that inflation continues to run at a 40-year high. In the meantime, we see that inflation is affecting prices at the pump and at grocery stores, but has spread to housing as well. Owning and renting have become more expensive. Mortgage rates have increased more than two percentage points since the beginning of the year. The monthly mortgage payment has increased by about $500 since the first week of January when rates were about 3.2%. Rents are rising fast as well. As a result, potential first-time buyers need to spend more out of pocket on rent, they also need to spend more on mortgage payments if they want to buy a home. Meanwhile, nearly 20% of the first-time buyers already spent 60% and more of their income on rent. Therefore, rising rents and inflation make it more challenging to save the money needed to make the transition into homeownership for these renters.</p>
<p>But, that is one side of the coin. On the flip side, what you need to keep in mind is that real estate is a good shelter from inflation and it is more attractive in a more inflationary period. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment remains the same (stabilizing housing costs). Homes also appreciate (in value) faster than inflation. Data has shown that, for example, commercial real estate, like other tangible assets, appreciates in value proportionally to inflation. Specifically, dividend increases from REITs have outpaced inflation in the past almost 20 years. If inflation is the result of strong economic growth, which is what is happening now, it is a good thing for commercial real estate.</p>
<p>Further, as many (home) buyers are priced out, we see that more people continue to rent. This trend benefits commercial real estate. However, as homebuying becomes less affordable, we expect the housing market to slow in 2022. In fact, home sales have dropped the last four months as many buyers can no longer afford to buy a home… We expect home sales to drop 9% in 2022, so we will have 5.5 million to 5.6 million homes sold in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> As the Federal Reserve continues to ratchet up short-term rates, where do you see the rates for residential and commercial mortgages by year’s end and into 2023?</p>
<p><strong>Evangelou:</strong> Inflation and mortgage rates are the two main drivers of the housing market. … According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year benchmark fixed mortgage rate rose to 5.51% from 5.3% the previous week. And with the potential of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve at the end of the month, mortgage rates will likely rise again further. However, I don’t expect to see the same sharp increases (in rates) that happened in the spring. Why? When the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest rates in March, mortgage rates surged about 80 basis points in the following three weeks. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose from 3.9% to 4.7% by the end of March. However, when the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates again in May by 50 basis points, mortgage rates increased by a level of 20 basis points and rates (eventually) fell to 5.1% by the end of May. The data shows that the effect of the Fed’s rate hike on mortgage rates was smaller in May than in March and this is the trend from the last rate hike in June.</p>
<p>It seems that mortgage rates have already priced in the effect of some of the upcoming rate hike, so even with this increase of rates, mortgage rates will continue to be historically low. We believe that interest rates will surpass 6% sometime in July and reach 6.5% by the year-end.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Do you believe a recession is in our future and if so, can you give a timeline and how severe will the downturn be?</p>
<p><strong>Evangelou:</strong> Everybody is wondering if there will be a recession later this year. I am by nature optimistic, but data also shows that there is no evidence of a recession right now. Savings rates have come down a bit, but household and business balance sheets look good. From the job market, we see low unemployment. It is back to the pre-pandemic level of 3.6%. A lot of people are working, so they have income every month. … In the housing market we have different conditions than we had back in 2007 and 2008 when there was an oversupply of homes (on the market for sale). Now, we have a severe housing shortage. To give you an idea, back in 2007, there were about four million homes (on the market). Today, there are a little over 1 million homes. Now, we have more strict financing so borrowers can pay their mortgages. The conditions right now are totally different in the housing market compared to 2008 (the last recession). So, we don’t expect to have a recession in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> While volume has decreased in the residential market, prices continue to rise. Do you see any relief in terms of decreasing rates of home affordability anytime soon?</p>
<p><strong>Evangelou:</strong> Unfortunately, affordability will continue to decline. The outlook is for mortgage rates and home prices to continue to rise. Borrowing costs will continue to increase in the coming months, eroding affordability even further. However, as I mentioned before, I don’t expect rates to rise as much as they did in the previous month. They will rise, but at a slower pace. Home prices will increase by about 8% for 2022 compared to 2021 when prices rose by 17%. We don’t expect to experience another year of double-digit home price appreciation. We don’t see (the lack of) affordability to ease anytime soon because the outlook is for both mortgage rates and home prices to continue to rise.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> On the commercial side, have increased costs impacted the volume of commercial financing deals and do you expect some multifamily and commercial projects delayed due to higher development costs?</p>
<p><strong>Evangelou:</strong> We have higher interest rates and inflation and higher prices are having a mixed impact on demand for commercial real estate. The pace of construction has slowed in the industrial and retail markets as consumers have cut back on spending due to inflation. However, higher mortgage rates and the continued return of workers to the office have increased the pace of absorption of multifamily units and office space.</p>
<p>Moreover, we also see that due to high interest rates, investor acquisitions over the past 12 months based on the data we have for May 2022 have decreased somewhat compared to same period during the first quarter of 2022; although the investment level is still above the pre-pandemic level. To give you an idea, the total acquisitions of multifamily, office, industrial and retail properties totaled about $580 billion in the last 12 months ended May 31 (2022) and that was about 7% below from the 12 months ended March 2022.</p>
<p>On the whole, commercial real estate is still expected to do well, despite high interest rates and inflation. Keep in mind that rising mortgage rates are boosting rental demand. Rents are high and growing fast. Commerce continues to boost the demand for logistics space. As for the demand for office space, even though workers don’t need to be back every day, we see that there is a continued return of workers to the office, even in hybrid modes like two or three days a week. … Demand for office space is returning and we see the big cities, the urban areas are coming back to life.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>PEARL RIVER—Global pharmaceutical firm Pfizer Inc. reports that it will spend $470 million to expand its vaccine research and development operations here.</p>
<p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> first reported, Pfizer confirmed to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that it plans over the next three years to secure necessary approvals and expand and modernize its campus with a new 260,000-square-foot lab building. The project will feature a total of 55,000 square feet of lab space. The new space is expected to be operational in 2026.</p>
<p>The plan by the Manhattan-headquartered firm, also calls for the addition of amenities such as a modern café, fitness center, parking garage and functional outdoor plaza, according to Jerica Pitts, Senior Director, Global Media Relations for Pfizer. “The rejuvenated campus will feature connected buildings and a prominent main entrance,” she said.</p>
<p>“Discussions about expanding Pearl River began before the pandemic, and Pfizer’s COVID research put more strain on its facilities,” Pitts said. “The additional space will allow more room and capabilities to expand ongoing work. The new design will have space for up to 370 workers and we plan to hire up to 150 more employees.”</p>
<p>The campus was formerly owned by Pfizer, which sold most of the property to Industrial Realty Group in 2015. The IRG campus, now known as Hudson Valley iCampus totals approximately 2 million square feet. Pfizer, which leases space at the Hudson Valley iCampus, occupies approximately 850,000 square feet of space on 33 contiguous acres it owns.</p>
<p>At press time it is unclear if the expansion space will be built on Pfizer owned or leased property.</p>
<p>Rockland County Executive Ed Day in a prepared statement, said of the Pfizer investment at the Pearl River property: &#8220;It’s heartening to see the renaissance this company has undergone during my administration. I’m happy to see these champions against a global health crisis planning to invest and create even deeper roots within our beautiful county with a $470-million expansion and 100 new hires. I commend Pfizer on its contribution to science and saving lives along with its commitment to calling Rockland home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hudson Valley iCampus tenants include Pfizer, Inc.; RK Pharma, Inc.; Sanofi US Services, Inc.; Iris Biogen Corp.; and Urban Electric Power, Inc. The property also features a 23-megawatt Central Utility Plant that provides electricity, steam and chilled water to the tenants and also to the buildings Pfizer’s owns.</p>
<p>Jamie Schwartz, president of Hudson Valley iCampus, said of Pfizer’s expansion, “Pfizer’s announcement is exciting and is in line with our collaboration with Pfizer and our common goal in making the Hudson Valley iCampus a place where innovation thrives as it is quickly becoming one of the Bio-Tech/Life Sciences hubs in the region.”</p>
<p>The campus has previously served as Lederle Laboratories’ R&amp;D, laboratory, manufacturing and headquarters, dating to the early 1900s. The property was later transferred to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Pfizer acquired Wyeth and the original 240-acre property in 2009 and sold 207 acres and 25 buildings to IRG in 2015.</p>
<p>Schwartz told Real Estate In-Depth that recently retailer Party City had signed a lease for 57,000 square feet of warehouse space. Back in April, Momentive Performance Materials Inc. announced it will be relocating its operations in Tarrytown to nearly 67,000 square feet of space at the 207-acre Hudson Valley iCampus property here in 2023.</p>
<p>Momentive Performance, which is headquartered in Waterford, (Saratoga County) NY will relocate next year from its current space at 769 Old Saw Mill River Road in Tarrytown.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Studies conducted in 2014 by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority projected precipitation in the New York region to increase by 1%-8% in the 2020s, 3%-12% in the 2050s, and 4%-15% in the 2080s. New York coastlines and the lower Hudson tidal areas are predicted to rise by 3-8 inches in the 2020s, 9-21 inches in the 2050s and up 39 inches in the 2080s. All these factors point to the potential of severe flooding in our area in the future.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, New York State counties, including Westchester County, have experienced an increase in the frequency and intensity of rainstorms. Flooding in 2007, 2011, and 2012 wreaked havoc in the surrounding areas. In 2021, a flash flood hit New York City, causing the water to quickly rise to more than five feet and resulted in the death of 11 individuals living in basement apartments. Not only has the flooding cost lives, but the flooding has also caused untold amounts of property damage, business closures, expensive capital repairs and loss of inventory. In some situations, unscrupulous landlords have made repairs to their properties, but they have failed to identify the potential flooding hazards/risks to new tenants. Those tenants, who are unaware of the propensity of significant and life-threatening flooding, run the risk of losing everything simply because the landlord does not want to disclose the prior condition for fear of losing a potential tenant and income.</p>
<p>As a result, Westchester County proposed and passed legislation mandating that landlords disclose flood conditions that exist or have existed on their properties. This disclosure is designed to protect and assist tenants, who will now have a remedy at law to recover the damages they may suffer at the hands of a landlord who fails to disclose all the details of the property they are leasing. It will also provide grounds for a civil action for equitable relief and costs. This law will further serve as a safety net to protect compliant landlords from liability and damage claims where they have properly disclosed their property’s propensity for flooding and the previous water heights.</p>
<p>This law, known as the “Flood History Disclosure Law,” was approved by the Westchester County Board of Legislators and signed by the Westchester County Executive George Latimer on June 29, 2022. This law shall take effect on Aug. 15, 2022 and will apply only to new leases or sublets, or renewals thereof, which take place after Aug. 15, 2022.</p>
<p>As a result, it is important that all real estate licensees be aware of its presence and understand its requirements.</p>
<p><strong>The Westchester Flood History Disclosure Law: Definitions</strong></p>
<p>First, the law defines “flood” as a general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation by water caused by:</p>
<p>• Overflow of inland tidal waters;</p>
<p>• Unusual or rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters for any established water source;</p>
<p>• Ponding of water at or near the place where heavy or excessive rain fell.</p>
<p>It defines “flood damage” very broadly as all varieties of harm resulting from a flood including conditions that have had a detrimental effect on property and people, including a person’s health.</p>
<p>Last, it defines “premises” as any portion of real property contained within a structure to which a tenant has the exclusive right to use or the authority to store non-real property within. Therefore, this means that the law applies to commercial as well as residential property, and includes any structure where tenants reside or where they use the premises merely for storage.</p>

<p>Any landlord who seeks to lease or rent any commercial or residential property, either through an agent or otherwise, must, prior to entering into a written lease agreement either directly or through their agent notify the prospective tenant of:</p>
<p>1. Whether the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps prepared by FEMA); and</p>
<p>2. The propensity for flooding of the premises, if flooding has occurred to the owner’s knowledge at least one time during the 10-year period immediately preceding the date of the lease, as well as the cause of the flood damage to any portion of the leased premises.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if a tenant seeks to sublet a property, this duty then falls upon the subletting tenant.</p>
<p><strong>The Westchester Flood History Disclosure Law: Form</strong></p>
<p>Under the new law, the landlord must provide a “Flood Disclosure Form” to the prospective tenant, which must be signed by both the landlord and the tenant, which sets forth notification of the premises’ propensity for flooding. Additionally, the landlord must also provide notification of where the water line was estimated in the premises. This form will be created by the Westchester County Planning Department and it will be available on its website or by hard copy upon request. (Note: At the time of this writing, the Flood Disclosure Form has yet to be made available).</p>
<p><strong>The Westchester Flood History Disclosure Law: Civil Cause of Action</strong></p>
<p>Any tenant who sustains flood damage during the course of his/her/their lease as a result of a landlord’s (or subletting tenant’s) failure to comply with this law may commence an action in court to recover such damages. In such an action, if the landlord is found to have been working in concert with another party as part of a common plan or design to violate the law, those defendants shall both be held jointly and severally liable for the damages, as well as any costs and fees awarded. Arguably, if a real estate agent is knowingly involved in such a scheme, they might be held liable.<br />
<strong><br />
Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is important to understand that the law and its duties apply to landlords, not real estate agents. While the law imposes no duty upon a real estate licensee to disclose such conditions, as a real estate licensee you should advise your client of the law and its requirements of providing an accurate and complete disclosure form. Further, as a Realtor pursuant to the Code of Ethics, you have an elevated duty to disclose any known condition that you are aware of relating to the property or the transaction and you should not exaggerate, misrepresent or conceal such facts, regardless of whether the landlord discloses it or not. If you exaggerate, misrepresent or conceal such facts, you may be subject to an Article 2 violation and expose yourself to potential disciplinary action, not to mention a potential investigation by the Department of State Licensing division.</p>

To be eligible, landlords/owners must charge rents that are affordable]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Westchester County Executive George Latimer announced on Aug. 9 the county had established a $10-million fund for small landlords to make repairs on their apartments with the proviso that they maintain affordable rent levels at their properties.</p>
<p>The Landlord Tenant Assistance Program will allow small landlords who own eight units or less, who maintain rent levels that are affordable to residents, to apply for up to $25,000 per unit for repairs to their rental properties. To be eligible, landlords/owners must charge rents that are affordable to households earning between no more than 60% and 100% of the Area Median Income.</p>
<p>Bedroom Size, 60% AMI Rent, 80% AMI Rent, 100% AMI Rent</p>
<p>Studio,                $1,457,  $1,942,  $2,427</p>
<p>One Bedroom,  $1,665,  $2,219,  $2,773</p>
<p>Two Bedroom,  $1,873,  $2,497,  $3,119</p>
<p>Three Bedroom, $2,080, $2,773, $3,465</p>
<p><em>Rent levels, with utilities included, must adhere to the 2022 HUD Guidelines above.</em></p>
<p><em>SOURCE: WESTCHESTER COUNTY</em></p>
<p>Home improvements may include, but are not limited to, roof replacement, or upgrades to electrical, windows, accessibility ramps, plumbing and heating systems. With $10 million in available funding, the county estimates the initiative could result in up to 400 units being rehabilitated.</p>
<p>The $10 million in funding for the program comes from the federal American Rescue Plan Act funding the county received.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic, and its aftermath, have greatly impacted our small landlords who have not been able to receive rent increases to make improvements to their properties in years,” Westchester County Executive Latimer said. “My administration stands committed to preserving affordable housing in all of our communities, and this funding will help our landlords make upgrades that will ultimately preserve the life of these units. We hope the prospect of receiving up to $25,000 per unit will incentivize our landlords to maintain their rental properties at a price point that everyone can afford.”</p>
<p>Latimer noted that the initiative was fueled by input from the Westchester County Board of Legislators and was bi-partisan.</p>
<p>Commissioner of the Department of Planning Norma Drummond said, “The Planning Department is excited to launch this program that particularly assists small landlords who need to make much needed repairs to their rental units. By offering this program, we know that we will help small landlords and renters alike, who were hit hard by the pandemic. LTAP funds will preserve and enhance smaller multi-family housing stock in the county that will improve the living conditions of many county residents and maintain its affordability.”</p>
<p>She said the county will try to make applying and securing funding from the program as simple as possible. Drummond said the county is not looking to collect data on tenants at these properties.</p>
<p>“We are looking to help the landlords as best we can,” she said.</p>
<p>Jackie Shaw, executive director of the non-profit Interfaith Council for Action (IFCA) Housing Network of Ossining, praised the new program that she said will provide needed assistance to small landlords who were “devastated” by the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>Chairwoman of the Westchester County Board of Legislators Catherine Borgia said of the new program, “I am grateful for our partnership with County Executive Latimer in negotiating this funding into the 2022 budget. This will have a positive effect for both landlords and tenants.”</p>
<p>Board of Legislators Majority Leader Chris Johnson added, “In Westchester, we are not only committed to keeping people in their homes, we are committed to making sure those homes are safe and healthy places to reside. As renters and landlords are working to get back on their feet from the pandemic, I am happy to partner with the County Executive to provide the funding for programs that not only keep a roof over people’s heads, but to make sure those roofs aren’t leaking as well.”</p>
<p>A Westchester County Rehabilitation Specialist will inspect the property after an application has been submitted to the Department of Planning. If the property qualifies, a three-party contract will be signed between the county, the landlord/owner and the contractor, for work to be completed by contractors that are licensed and insured to work in Westchester County. Funds will be disbursed directly to the contractor from the county after a progress inspection has been completed.</p>
<p>Interested landlords/owners should call or e-mail Gaitre Rambharose in the Westchester County Department of Planning at 914-995-2429 or <a href="mailto:gqrh@westchestergov.com">gqrh@westchestergov.com</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Westchester County utilized federal funding programs targeted at the multifamily sector.</p>
<p>Back in September 2020, during the height of the COVID pandemic, Westchester launched the “Community Build Back Program” that included two programs that utilized HUD money—the RED STOP Eviction Project and the RED Rent HELP Project—along with two other separate initiatives that utilized $10 million in CARES ACT funding targeted for homeowners and small business.</p>
<p>The RED STOP Eviction Project utilized federal HUD funds and provided up to four months of rental or utility arrears for tenants that faced eviction or shut off as long as they could demonstrate that their financial hardship was due to COVID.</p>
<p>The RED Rent HELP Project utilized federal HUD funds and provided up to 12 months of rental assistance for families impacted by COVID. The program was focused on households where the tenants worked in industries closed during the COVID lockdown or who worked for a business that no longer existed.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The plan, if approved, would help the MTA raise revenue of approximately $15 billion to help fund its $54.8-billion 2020-2024 Capital Program and future capital programs.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The details of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s long-delayed and controversial congestion pricing plan were unveiled on Aug. 10. The plan, which will now be the subject of public hearings later this month, calls for the implementation of peak tolls to enter Manhattan’s Central Business District ranging from $9 to as high as $23.</p>
<p>The plan, if approved, would help the MTA raise revenue of approximately $15 billion to help fund its $54.8-billion 2020-2024 Capital Program and future capital programs.</p>
<p>The Federal Highway Administration, New York State Department of Transportation, MTA Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and New York City Department of Transportation released the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Central Business District Tolling Program in Manhattan. The report studied a total of seven different tolling scenarios. Tolls would be charged to most vehicles once a day. Overnight tolls range from $5 to as high as $12, while off-peak tolls could run from $7 to $17.</p>
<p>There would be some discounts and extensions granted. For example, the report notes that there would be exemptions for qualifying vehicles transporting a person with disabilities and qualifying authorized emergency vehicles. In addition, residents whose primary residence is inside the Manhattan CBD and whose New York State adjusted gross income is less than $60,000 would be eligible for a New York State tax credit equal to the amount of Manhattan CBD tolls paid during the taxable year.</p>
<p>The CBD subject to the congestion pricing plan consists of the geographic area of Manhattan south of and inclusive of 60th Street, not including the Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) Drive and the West Side Highway/Route 9A, the Battery Park Underpass and any surface roadway portion of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel that connects to West Street (the West Side Highway/Route 9A).</p>
<p>The Environmental Assessment found the program would result in either beneficial effects or no adverse effects for the majority of topics studied, including regional air quality, regional transportation, and parking. Where potential adverse effects were identified, mitigation was provided.</p>
<p>The assessment found that 85% of existing work trips to the CBD are made by transit, 5% by car from New York City, 3% by car from New York suburban counties, 3% by car from New Jersey, 0.2% by car from Connecticut, and 4% by other modes, including taxis, for-hire vehicles, bicycling and walking.</p>
<p>“The tremendous detail included in this assessment makes clear the widespread benefits that would result from central business district tolling,” said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber. “Bottom line: congestion pricing is good for the environment, good for public transit and good for New York and the region. We look forward to receiving public feedback in the weeks ahead.”<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-41879" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mta-congestion-pricing-chart-1024x791.jpg?_t=1660142238" alt="" width="800" height="618" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mta-congestion-pricing-chart.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View image</a></strong></p>
<p>State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “The release of this Environmental Assessment is an important step forward in this transformative initiative to help us reduce congestion in Manhattan’s central business district. I encourage everyone to attend the public hearings and provide feedback and comments, so that we can make improvements and deliver a comprehensive plan.”</p>
<p>New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, “We must get congestion pricing done so we can invest in public transit, curb emissions, and reduce traffic, which has roared back to pre-COVID levels. This draft Environmental Assessment is the product of three years of detailed study and is a major milestone towards delivering congestion pricing for New Yorkers. We’re looking forward to hearing from the public during this important review process and we thank the MTA, state, and federal partners for their collaboration.”</p>
<p>Among the key findings of the assessment were:</p>
<p>• Implementation of tolls would achieve the purpose and need of the project—to reduce traffic congestion in the Manhattan CBD in a manner that will generate revenue for future transportation improvements.</p>
<p>• With initiation of the program, the number of vehicles entering the CBD would decline by 15.4% to 19.9%, depending on the tolling scenario. Traffic elsewhere in the region would change between—1.5% to 0.2%, depending on the location and the tolling scenario.</p>
<p>• Air quality would improve overall, with greater beneficial effects within and closer to the CBD.</p>
<p>• Reduction in traffic would result in increased reliability of bus service and</p>
<p>• Increase transit ridership by 1% to 2%.</p>
<p>The project partners received more than 7,300 comments in early enhanced outreach as the Environmental Assessment was being prepared, according to the MTA.</p>
<p>A series of virtual public hearings have been scheduled that will take place from Aug. 25 through Aug. 31, as well as a meeting of the Environmental Justice Stakeholder Working Group, on Aug. 19, and a meeting of the Environmental Justice Technical Advisory Group, for Aug. 22. The project partners are accepting comments online, via e-mail, mail, voicemail and fax.</p>
<p>Following the public review period, the Federal Highway Administration will determine whether establishment of the program would result in significant effects in addition to the widespread benefits detailed in the assessment. The FHWA will issue one of two documents responding to the environmental assessment: either a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), establishing that any adverse effects are not significant or can be mitigated below significant level, or, if determined that there are significant effects that cannot be mitigated, a request for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) requiring further study of the proposed program.</p>
<p>If the FHWA approves the project, contractors would have 310 days to design, develop and implement the tolling infrastructure and tolling system technology that would process the tolls, the MTA stated.</p>
<p>Comments are being accepted online, by e-mail, mail, phone and fax, and at a series of six public hearings beginning on Thursday, Aug. 25, and concluding on Wednesday, Aug. 31. Members of the public who wish to speak at the hearings can sign up online at <a href="http://mta.info/CBDTP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mta.info/CBDTP</a>. The hearings will be accessible online at <a href="http://mta.info/CBDTP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mta.info/CBDTP</a> at these dates and times:</p>

Tuesday, Aug. 30, 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.<br />

While more and more people are working remotely and attending meetings and events remotely, it only makes sense that a real estate closing move to a “remote” setti]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In New York, as in many other states, the closing process is a long and arduous one and the new Remote Online Notarization (“RON”) law [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3SIBHX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3SIBHX8</a>] provides one of the tools to speed up the process in the future. Remote notarization laws in New York and across the nation move the closing process one step closer to a full “remote” closing. While more and more people are working remotely and attending meetings and events remotely, it only makes sense that a real estate closing move to a “remote” setting as well.</p>
<p><strong>The Closing Process in New York</strong></p>
<p>A closing in New York, which involves financing, customarily takes 60, 90 and sometimes up to 120 days to complete from contract signing to closing. In many areas in New York, before a contract is even prepared, purchasers must first complete their inspections and then receive and review the results of those inspections, which could take several days, especially where a radon or well test is involved. If issues come up, the process could take even longer. Once the results are received, and all of the issues, if any, are addressed, only then is the contract prepared by the seller’s counsel and sent to the purchaser’s counsel. The negotiation process between the attorneys takes several days as well. A seller’s attorney will customarily attach a rider to the form contract. The purchaser’s attorney also prepares a purchaser’s rider. After the contract and all of the riders are negotiated, finalized, and executed by the parties, the process officially begins.</p>
<p><strong>The Loan Application Process</strong></p>
<p>It is at this point that the purchaser usually begins the mortgage application process. While many purchasers begin the loan process before the contract of sale is signed, many lenders will not officially submit the loan application until they have a fully executed contract. This is why it is very important for purchasers to submit all of the required financial documentation (e.g., tax returns, W-2s, paystubs, bank statements, etc.) to their lender. Submitting all of the required documentation in advance saves valuable time and can shorten the period of time to obtain a mortgage commitment from the lender by several days, and even weeks. Most contracts require that a purchaser obtain and deliver a mortgage commitment to the seller within 30 days of the contract date. Although, in some instances, the lender can take up to 45 days or more.</p>
<p><strong>Ordering the Title Search on the Property</strong></p>
<p>At the same time a fully executed contract is exchanged by the parties, the purchaser’s attorney places the order for a title search on the property and a new survey, if one is not available. The title search usually takes several weeks to be completed. Many times, the title and lien search component of a title search comes back fairly quickly. However, the municipal search component (i.e., the search of the town records relating to violations, certificates of occupancy and/or compliance, and other municipal records) can take up to two to four weeks (or more) due to lingering delays from the COVID-19 pandemic arising from a lack of personnel and remote work schedules, as well as other reasons. Additionally, if a purchaser is required to order a new survey, this can add an additional three to four weeks to the process.</p>
<p>Once the new survey and the title search are received, it is the hope of the parties that no issues come up. Unfortunately, however, many times this is not the case. In the event violations, boundary line issues, liens, pending lawsuits, tax liens, old mortgages (that were never satisfied), illegal construction items (i.e., decks, extensions, fences, etc.) or other issues come up, then this could certainly add several weeks, if not months, to the entire closing time frame.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, the Closing!</strong></p>
<p>After all of the loan, title and municipal issues are dealt with, the parties are finally ready to schedule the closing. Once the lender issues the “clearance to close” or “CTC,” the parties are then ready to schedule the actual closing. Prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, most closings required that all of the parties attend the actual closing. While some sellers would provide their attorney with a power of attorney to close on their behalf, most purchasers, as well as all other parties (i.e., attorneys, bank attorneys, title closers, etc.) were required to attend the actual closing in person. The COVID-19 pandemic changed all of this overnight.</p>
<p><strong>The “Remote Closing” is Born</strong></p>
<p>In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the real estate closing process to take an unexpected turn. The term “remote closing” was born. While not the only catalyst, the “remote closing” was one of the key factors that assisted the real estate market with its unprecedented rebound. Born out of necessity and safety, the remote closing allowed parties to continue to close without actually having to attend the closing. Attorneys scheduled Zoom conferences, mailed closing documents and packages out to clients to have them pre-signed, title closers and attorneys picked up and hand-delivered documents to the parties to facilitate a “remote closing,” bank attorneys met with borrowers and their attorneys to have the loan documents signed, all done to keep everyone safe and sound during one of the most dangerous and deadly pandemics in history. During this time, one critical and early executive order assisted tremendously with the “remote closing” process, Executive Order 202.7.</p>
<p><strong>Executive Order 202.7: The Predecessor to NY’s Remote Online Notarization Law</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, then Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.7, which allowed notaries to conduct remote ink notarizations during the pandemic. Unlike the requirements of RON, Executive Order 202.7 allowed notaries to conduct notarial services by simply using real-time video. An individual would simply be required to present valid identification via a video conferencing platform (e.g., Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) and then send the signed document to the notary so that the notary could notarize the original. The remote notarization allowed by Executive Order 202.7 allowed for parties to remain in the comfort and safety of their own home, and made the closing process a bit easier and a bit quicker. The original Executive Order 202.7 also required that the individual be located in the State of New York when the notarization took place.</p>
<p><strong>The New RON Law and the Interim Use of the RIN Process</strong></p>
<p>The original RON legislation [Senate Bill 1780-C] [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3PgPvVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3PgPvVA</a>] that was signed into law in December 2021, and which was supposed to take effect in June, 2022, did not permit the use of RINs. However, in February 2022, Senate Bill 7780 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3JGivFj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3JGivFj</a>] was passed making key amendments to Senate Bill 1780-C. It moved the effective date of the RON legislation to Jan. 30, 2023, and also allowed for the interim use of the RIN procedure until Jan. 30, 2023. The amendment also allows for Notaries during the RIN interim period to perform notarial acts without being required to pay additional fees or to register with New York State. However, when the RON law goes into effect in January 2023, Notaries will be required to register on a new New York State Registration Database and pay additional fees in order to be permitted to perform RONs.</p>
<p>The amendment to the RON and RIN procedures permits a Notary to notarize an individual’s signature even if that person is located out of New York State. Subsection (2)(H) of the newly added Section 135-C of the Remote Ink Notarization law provides that while the Notary must be physically located in New York at the time the notarization takes place, it further provides that:</p>
<p><em>“The principal may be situated in New York, outside of New York but inside the United States, or outside the United States, provided:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) the record is to be filed with or relates to a matter before a public official or court, governmental entity, or other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; or </em></p>
<p><em>(2) the record involves property located in the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or involves a transaction substantially connected with the United States.”</em></p>
<p>Senate Bill 7780 provided additional procedural requirements and best practices that were not part of the original Executive Order 202.7. Senate Bill 7780 requires that for both RONs and RINs, the Notary must utilize real-time audio-video when notarizing a document and must make an audio-video record of the remote notarization and maintain a record of each notarization for 10 years. Further, the notary must confirm the identity of the individual signing the document by having: (a) personal knowledge of the individual, (b) by requesting that the individual provide valid identification or credentials, analyzing the credentials, and conducting identity proofing of the individual, or (3) by having a credible witness confirm identity. The Notary must maintain a contemporaneous journal of each remote notarization and will be required to produce the journal to the Secretary of State for inspection. The Notary must also prepare the following “Certificate of Authenticity” so that documents may be recorded with the County Clerk:</p>
<p>“Certificate of Authenticity</p>
<p>State of New York                )</p>
<p>County of                     ) ss.:</p>
<p>On this        day of                  in the year                   , I certify that the signature page of the attached record (entitled                           ) (dated                              ) is a true and accurate copy of the signatures affixed to an electronic record printed by me or under my supervision. I further certify that, at the time of printing, no security features present on the electronic record indicated any changes or errors in an electronic signature in the electronic record after its creation or execution.</p>
<p>(Signature and Title of Notary Public)</p>
<p>(Official Stamp or Registration Number, with expiration date of the Notary Public’s Commission)”</p>
<p>The Secretary of State is authorized to promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards for various aspects of remote notarization, as well as for any other matters necessary to administer the provisions set forth in Senate Bill 7780.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Notarization at the Federal Level</strong></p>
<p>On July 27, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed various bills which included the Securing and Enabling Commerce Using Remote and Electronic (SECURE) Notarization Act [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3SGDaNm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3SGDaNm</a>]. The SECURE Notarization Act seeks to allow for immediate nationwide use of RON. It also seeks to create federal minimum standards for its use nationwide and also to provide certainty for the interstate recognition of RON. The SECURE Notarization Act will go a long way in providing lenders the comfort to allow for remote notarization in connection with loans, as well as protecting individuals and allowing those individuals who are not able to attend a closing for various reasons to be able to utilize RON in connection with the real estate closing.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Notarization: Simplifying the Closing Process</strong></p>
<p>While there is still a way to go before the real estate industry fully embraces and implements remote notarization into the closing process, once it does the possibilities are limitless. Remote notarization can certainly speed up the closing process by eliminating the inefficiencies of having numerous individuals attend a closing just to sign documents before a Notary. The long and onerous closing process could be made much easier and remote notarization brings the real estate industry one step closer to eliminating the physical closing altogether.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[So what housing options are out there for the average family, single person, or senior living on social security?]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The phrase “affordable housing” may seem like an oxymoron in the Hudson Valley, where second quarter median sales prices for single-family homes soared to $885,000 in Westchester, $645,000 in Rockland, $617,500 in the Bronx, $480,000 in Putnam, and $415,000 in Orange County. Only Sullivan County held out as somewhat affordable with a median single-family home price of $259,900, according to OneKey MLS data.</p>
<p>Rental costs are no different, with the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in White Plains at $3,093, according to Rent Café. New Rochelle’s average rent came in at $2,499 and Yonkers, $2,253. Middletown in Orange County had a significant difference at $1,839 and in the Bronx, $1,682.</p>
<p>So what housing options are out there for the average family, single person, or senior living on social security?</p>
<p>Westchester Residential Opportunities has been working hard for the past 55 years to alleviate the dilemma of finding safe and affordable housing. Founded in 1968, WRO’s mission is promoting equal, affordable and accessible housing for all residents in the region.</p>
<p>Basically, affordability is defined as a household paying no more than 30% of its gross income toward housing costs. For example, if two people in a household have a combined income of $100,000, they should be spending no more than $30,000 annually on housing—either rent or mortgage payments.</p>
<p>Anything over 30% is considered to be a cost burden, while more than 50% is deemed as a severe cost burden. A 2019 Westchester County assessment survey found that 41% of the population paid more than 30% of household income toward rents or mortgage payments.</p>
<p>“There’s just not enough affordable housing in our region, and it’s even more difficult now with the cost-of-living increases in food and gas prices,” said Marlene Zarfes, WRO Executive Director. “One of the reasons for this is that different areas have different zoning laws and the larger parcels are typically zoned for single-family homes.”</p>
<p>As a result, noted Zarfes, most of Westchester’s affordable housing can be found in the cities like Yonkers, New Rochelle, Peekskill and Mount Vernon, which allow for more multiple dwellings. Since many of these residents may not have cars, they also need to be close to public transportation.</p>
<p>Many of the calls WRO receives are from seniors, people with disabilities, single parents, or young people who want to move out of their parents’ homes but can’t afford the market rents. “Most of these people are working full-time jobs but still can’t manage the escalating rental costs or home prices,” added Zarfes. “We also see a lot of people coming up from Manhattan looking for something more affordable here.”</p>
<p>Zarfes indicates the problem of finding affordable housing in the area is something affecting people from all walks of life. “It’s all races, genders and ages,” she said. “Housing is one of the most important things in someone’s life.”</p>
<p>Through its AffordableWestchester.org website, WRO offers listings of affordable homes for rent or purchase. Most are available to qualified applicants on a lottery basis, although some may be first come, first served.</p>
<p>Listed as “coming soon” are 141 studio, one and two-bedroom apartments at High Garden Tower in New Rochelle with rents ranging from $1,264 to $2,166 per month. In addition, five one and two-bedroom units at Path Knolls Apartments will be available in Ossining, with monthly rents from $1,453 to $1,751.</p>
<p>A one-bedroom unit in Bowridge Commons in Rye Brook will be available for re-sale soon for those considering purchasing a home. “Often, when people talk about affordable housing, they think it will be substandard housing and occupied by homeless people,” said Zarfes. “But the fact is, many of these are working people and affordable housing is now being constructed to blend in with the local community.”</p>
<p>Wilder Balter Partners Development LLC, a residential real estate development firm based in Chappaqua, has been building both market rate and affordable housing throughout the Hudson Valley and tri-state area for the last 30 years. “There’s still a great need for well-priced housing of all types throughout the Hudson Valley, and we make sure that all of our affordable developments look just like our other beautiful residential communities,” said Bill Balter.</p>
<p>The firm, along with Griffin Construction LLC, has worked with many housing authorities throughout the region to build new housing, remodel existing structures, and incorporate affordable units within some market rate rental buildings. Their 35 communities include 3,670 apartments in the tri-state area, and another nine now in development that will add almost 2,000 apartments.</p>
<p>A 109-unit affordable, multifamily rental community for seniors is currently under construction on Main Street in Tarrytown. Located at the site of the former Tarrytown YMCA, it will include 14 studios and 95 one-bedroom apartments. Featured amenities are a lounge, library, exercise room, computer and laundry rooms and a rooftop park.<br />
The development is being financed by the New York State Housing Finance Agency, Westchester County, and the Tarrytown Housing Fund, and is expected to be complete by 2023.</p>

<p>On Peekskill’s Main Street, WBP Development is building 82 affordable rental units, again financed by the NYS Housing Agency and Westchester County. With similar amenities to the Tarrytown project, the building is slated for competition by next year as well.</p>
<p>Station Plaza, a 109-unit affordable multifamily rental community in Ossining, will include one, two and three-bedroom apartments, plus retail and community space. The building will also be within walking distance of the Hudson River waterfront and the Metro-North train station.</p>
<p>“Generally, we have to do a lot of education to the local communities about what we’re proposing,” explained Balter. “We even bring people to our other communities, so they can get a better understanding of what we build.”</p>
<p>Additional completed rental developments include Roundtop Commons in Montrose, Hillcrest Commons in Carmel, Jacobs Hill in Cortlandt Manor, and Livingston Arms in Poughkeepsie. Chappaqua Crossing, a market-rate rental property at the former Reader’s Digest building, offers a limited number of affordable rental units. “Our goal in building these communities is to ensure that they’ll remain affordable in the long-term,” added Balter.</p>
<p>For those who may not qualify for affordable housing, but still want a stakehold on home ownership, co-ops are still the most affordable housing option. The OneKey MLS second quarter report showed Westchester’s median co-op sales price at $203,000.</p>
<p>“Co-ops are a good opportunity for first-time homebuyers as well as people who are downsizing,” said Barry Kramer, WRO Board member and Broker-Owner of BHG Real Estate Choice Realty in Scarsdale and Hartsdale. While the costs are definitely lower than condos or single-family homes, Kramer cautions potential co-op buyers about retaining sufficient funds for a down payment and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>Down payment requirements vary from building to building, with some insisting on 20% to 50% of the total cost. On a $200,000 co-op, a 20% down payment of $40,000, plus cash reserves to cover maintenance costs, could be overwhelming for many younger people just starting their careers. “Not only would they have to provide the cash down, but they’d also need to show liquid assets for the next six or 12 months to demonstrate they can cover the monthly maintenance charges,” Kramer explained. “This would likely be less of an issue for seniors, who may be downsizing after the sale of a larger home.”</p>
<p>Kramer also notes that co-op costs can vary drastically based on their locations. “Prices are usually going to be higher than the median in areas like Bronxville or Scarsdale,” he added.</p>
<p>To educate first time homebuyers, WRO continues to offer its online First-Time Home Buyers Program, which is a two-hour webinar presenting an overview of the homebuying process, and housing options.</p>
<p>On October 13, WRO will hold its Fair &amp; Affordable Housing Symposium at the White Plains Library from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. The event is free to attend and will include a reception afterwards.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>RYE BROOK—In 2001, Dr. Marsha Gordon took the reins of The Business Council of Westchester. In those more than 20 years, she has increased the organization’s membership and elevated its reputation as a respected business advocacy organization not only in Westchester, but in the Hudson Valley and throughout the state.</p>
<p>With the specter of a possible recession on some economic forecasters’ radar, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> thought Dr. Gordon could provide some perspective on some of the key issues facing the Business Council’s membership in 2022 and beyond and whether they believe a deep downturn or recession is in the cards in 2022 or 2023.</p>
<p>Dr. Gordon’s credentials also include serving as President of the Greater Southern Dutchess Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, she served as President of Build the Bridge Now, which helped fast track the building of the new Tappan Zee Bridge. Dr. Gordon has served on several boards including on the executive committee of the Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Council, the Business Council of New York State and the Westchester-Putnam Workforce Investment Board. She holds a BA from Brooklyn College, an MBA from Marist College, and a Doctorate in Business Administration from Pace University.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-41988" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Marsha-Gordon-1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: You have been President and CEO of The Business Council of Westchester since 2001. In that more than two-decade span, what would you say is the most important change that has taken place in Westchester County?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gordon</strong>: I can really point to several things. First, the incredible growth of the urban centers in the cities and the residential building in all of the cities in Westchester and the opportunity that provides. The residential and commercial (development) and now in Yonkers with the film and video sector and the vibrancy of the cities is so different from when I came when the downtowns were dead. … Even the downtowns in the villages and towns (have improved). You look at Tarrytown and Ossining and Port Chester and some of these other locations that have become vibrant and exciting places for people to live, work and play and that is a huge change that I have seen in Westchester County.</p>
<p>I would also say that we have changed from a county of major corporations. While some are still here and we are thankful for that and they are a very important part of our economy, we have also become a very diversified economy with many small businesses, as well as mid-sized businesses, a thriving not-for-profit sector that is part of the economic structure and life sciences. And we cannot underestimate how these (past) 20 years have also mirrored the growth of Regeneron (Pharmaceuticals).</p>
<p>Also, another change is that as co-chair of the Mid-Hudson Regional Council, I have seen how that process has changed the way money has been allocated (for economic development projects) in a most positive way.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Dr. Gordon serves as Mid Hudson Regional Council co-chair along with Dr. Kristine Young, President, SUNY Orange.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-41989" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Marsha-Gordon-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" />Dr. Gordon also identified the growth of life sciences, and the healthcare sectors and the shift, particularly along the I-287 corridor, from large suburban office campuses to other uses. She added:</p>
<p>Two shifts happened. Big buildings were occupied by one corporation. This building—800 Westchester Ave. (in Rye Brook)—used to be occupied by Philip Morris. Now it is multi-tenanted thanks to Robert Weisz (the building owner) who came in and created that change at the property. Also, the shift of many of the properties along I-287, the Platinum Mile—which have become largely healthcare and mixed-use where people are living, working and playing.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: Do you believe affordable housing is a key issue for Westchester going forward? If so, is there anything that the Business Council is doing or advocating for with other not-for profits or business advocacy organizations that will begin to address the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gordon</strong>: So, absolutely affordable housing is a major issue. We do work with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. We have from a legislative point of view supported legislation to make housing more accessible, strengthen Fair Housing Laws, provide relief to tenants and building owners and expand access to homeownership. From an economic development point of view, we have our Coalition for Smart Development, which is a coalition of 17 leading (real estate) developers, who are all committed to creating more affordable housing throughout the county. This year we honored (affordable housing developer) Bill Balter at our Hall of Fame to really shine the light on affordable housing. Some years ago, we honored (MacQuesten Companies CEO) Rella Fogliano. MacQuesten’s Joe Apicella is also on our Board. So, we have people on our Board representing the housing industry. And, legislatively and from an economic development point of view we work to support affordable housing and work with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, as well as the Building and Realty Institute.</p>
<p>Affordable housing will continue to be an issue. It is an issue in Westchester, it is an issue in New York City and elsewhere. It is something that the Business Council of Westchester will continue to stay highly focused on.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Dr. Gordon pointed to the Business Council’s legislative agenda for 2022 that includes its opposition to Good Cause Eviction legislation, support for the protection of independent contractor status for real estate licensees, support for the strengthening of Fair Housing Laws, support for legislation that expands access to homeownership and the opposition to any legislation that would increase state, local mortgage recording or real estate transfer taxes .</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-41992" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Marsha-Gordon-5.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: What are the key issues facing Westchester businesses in 2022?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gordon</strong>: Number one is talent recruitment. That is the number one issue—getting labor, getting people to work, figuring out this hybrid workforce and how that is going to work and shake out? Hiring employees is the number one issue and we see it in every industry from hospitality and retail on one end to professional accountants and attorneys to medical.</p>
<p>(In the real estate development arena) some of the hospitality workers have shifted to construction as an alternative. We are working with our Coalition for Smart Development to develop a program that will look at educational opportunities for those employed in that sector.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: How big is the nearly $2-billion expansion by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for the push by many to make Westchester a biotechnology hub?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gordon</strong>: This is a game changer like we haven’t experienced. It is certainly research, but it is also advanced manufacturing and so that is going to open the door for so many other opportunities for people in Westchester County. So, we have to look at the training programs and the education programs to make sure that we are feeding Regeneron. I think the growth of Regeneron is like none other the county has ever seen. It has also changed the dynamic of people coming from other areas to work at Regeneron. The reverse commute so to speak.</p>
<p>So, this has made Westchester a destination for work as well as to live. We see this as the number one game changer in Westchester County in the last 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Commenting on Pfizer’s nearly $500 million expansion in Rockland County, Dr. Gordon said, “I think on either end of the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, there should be a sign that says, ‘Welcome to the Biotechnology Capital of the World.’ This is where COVID was addressed and cures were found by Regeneron and Pfizer. That should link our valley together…</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-41990" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Marsha-Gordon-3.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: Do you believe the Westchester economy is in recession at the moment? If not, do you believe that an economic downturn is in the cards?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gordon</strong>: I think there is no area that is immune from what happens on a national and global level and whether we call it a recession or not we are definitely going through some tough times on every level. However, we have seen that Westchester, even during the pandemic, because we are such a diverse business community and frankly such a resilient business community, weathered the storm very well and there is no doubt in my mind that the businesses in Westchester are very well poised to face and continue to thrive with whatever comes our way. The pandemic was devasting to so many industries. For the real estate sector, it (eventually) became an opportunity and for other sectors also. I think we are an extremely resilient community and diverse enough that we can withstand tough times.</p>

Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James announced on Aug. 30 the state had reached settlements with three Long Island real estate brokerage firms found to have engaged in discriminatory practices and Fair Housing Law violations first uncovered in an investigation by Newsday in late 2019.</p>
<p>Following the Newsday report, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of State opened parallel investigations into Keller Williams Greater Nassau, Keller Williams Realty Elite and Laffey Real Estate. The probe by the OAG concluded that LRE, KWRE, and KWGN engaged in discriminatory practices that violated state and federal fair housing laws. The parallel investigations found that agents associated at these firms steered prospective homebuyers of color away from white neighborhoods and subjected them to different requirements than white homebuyers, and otherwise engaged in biased behavior.</p>
<p>In some documented cases, agents were recorded showing preferential treatment to white homebuyers, disparaging neighborhoods of color, and directing homebuyers of color to homes in neighborhoods where residents predominantly belonged to communities of color.</p>
<p>State officials announced that as part of agreements with the three brokerage firms, the brokerage firms are required to spend more than $115,000 to remedy their discriminatory practices and undergo regular fair housing trainings. Specifically, LRE is required to pay $30,000 to the state and $35,000 to Suffolk County to conduct unannounced fair housing testing of any LRE agent at any LRE branch. In addition, LRE must create an online complaint form for potential buyers and sellers to report any potential instances of discrimination, and LRE is required to provide quarterly fair housing trainings to all its agents.</p>
<p>KWGN and KWRE, under a global settlement with OAG and DOS, are required to pay $25,000 to Suffolk County to promote enforcement of and compliance with fair housing laws. KWGN and KWRE must also spend up to $25,000 on fair housing courses and trainings for its agents.</p>
<p>“Efforts to discriminate against any New Yorker&#8217;s fair access to housing cannot, and will not, be tolerated,” said Attorney General James. “These investigations have uncovered a pervasive culture of allowing unlawful discrimination and violations of every New Yorker’s right to fair housing. These settlements should send a clear message: if you discriminate and deny New Yorkers their basic right to housing, we will take action.”</p>
<p>“With these actions, we’re delivering a forceful message: New York State has zero tolerance for discrimination,” said Gov. Hochul. “Here in New York, we firmly believe that housing is a human right and I thank Attorney General James and Secretary of State Rodriguez for their work to enforce our laws and protect that right for all New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>“Real estate professionals in New York State have an obligation to provide fair and equitable services to all,” said Secretary of State Robert J. Rodriguez. “Housing discrimination is illegal, and the Department will not tolerate New Yorker’s rights being violated. This comprehensive fair housing settlement demonstrates that New York’s leadership is making sure every New Yorker has equal access to housing. The penalties and agreements with these real estate companies educate their agents about housing laws to ensure New Yorkers are protected.”</p>
<p>The Attorney General’s investigation involved review of two paired tests conducted on LRE agents—one in the firm’s Huntington office and another in Great Neck. In Huntington, LRE was found to have required a potential Black homebuyer to obtain a pre-approval letter from a mortgage lender before he was shown a home, while the same standard was not applied to a white homebuyer. In Great Neck, an LRE agent lectured a Hispanic potential homebuyer about his finances, suggesting that he limit his search to an area he could afford without any insight into his financial situation. The same agent did not give the affordability lecture to a white homebuyer looking for homes in the same neighborhood and instead steered him towards neighborhoods that were less diverse, stating, “Do you want your kids to be in school with kids that they relate to?” Based on a thorough review of evidence collected throughout the investigation, OAG determined that LRE’s agents unlawfully discriminated against homebuyers based on race, color, and national origin, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p>KWRE and KWGN also engaged in illegal and discriminatory housing practices, according to the Attorney General’s office. For example, one agent warned a white potential homebuyer against a particular neighborhood, citing recent gang violence, but then proceeded to tell a Black potential homebuyer that the same area has “the nicest people.” The Black potential homebuyer was also directed toward predominantly non-white areas more than the white potential homebuyer, in a practice known as racial steering. A KWGN agent required a Black potential homebuyer sign an exclusivity agreement before touring homes, but showed properties to a white potential homebuyer immediately, without any mention of such an agreement. In another instance, the agent told a white potential homebuyer to avoid school districts where a majority of the students were of color, saying they were not good schools, and even admitting to the potential homebuyer, “legally, I get in big trouble if I [tell you this].”</p>
<p>The paired tests conducted controlled for race as the only variable: the prospective homebuyers otherwise submitted similar financial profiles and identical terms for their future homes.</p>
<p>The OAG concluded that LRE, KWRE, and KWGN violated the Fair Housing Act and the New York State Human Rights Law.</p>
<p>The Attorney General’s office noted that an investigation into another unnamed real estate brokerage is ongoing. The DOS has taken action against individual licensed agents, which included the revocation of a license belonging to a former KWGN agent and imposed a fine against an individual former KWRE agent. Several DOS investigations into LRE and its agents also remain pending.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW ROCHELLE—An affiliate of Boston-based The DSF Group, which has been a very active player in the Westchester County multifamily sector, has sold Halstead Station, a 24-story, 408-unit, luxury tower adjacent to the New Rochelle Metro North train station, for $200 million.</p>
<p>The deal was announced by brokerage firm JLL, which represented The DSF Group in the transaction. Kholsa Capital LLC acquired the asset in a preferred equity venture with Pacific Urban Investors.</p>
<p>Built in 2001, Halstead Station features studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units with open floor plans, large windows with panoramic views, light-filled kitchens and plush carpeting.

<p>“We are excited to acquire an institutional quality asset in one of Westchester County’s premier locations. Given its strategic location, its value-add potential and all the development in New Rochelle, Halstead Station is a great fit for our portfolio. We look forward to improving the property; enhancing the living experience for our residents and creating value for our investors,” Khosla Capital said in a statement.</p>
<p>The JLL Capital Markets Investment Advisory team representing the seller was led by Jose Cruz, Steve Simonelli, Michael Oliver, Andrew Scandalios, Kevin O&#8217;Hearn, Marion Jones and Josh Stein.</p>
<p>“Demand for New Rochelle multi-housing remains very strong with investors underwriting significant rental upside in the market,” stated JLL’s Cruz.</p>

<p>The DSF Group has been very active in Westchester County. In December 2018, the DSF Group sold the 40-story Halstead New Rochelle Metro North apartment tower here for $259.4 million to a partnership of Azure Partners and Harbor Group International, LLC. The DSF Group had acquired the 588-unit apartment building in 2013 for more than $210 million.</p>
<p>In November 2016, The DSF Group purchased the La Rochelle, a 412-unit, 25-story luxury apartment tower in New Rochelle, for $148.5 million in a deal brokered by HFF. The DSF Group purchased the asset free and clear of existing debt.</p>
<p>Outside of New Rochelle, in early 2017, the DSF Group sold its Halstead White Plains property near the White Plains train station to Ginsburg Development Companies. The 12-story, 124-unit rental building traded for $35.25 million.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Have you ever run into a situation where your homeowner tells you that they’re not going to pay your commission? When I first became involved in the real estate world, I would hear these stories and how brokers would march down to the local courthouse to file a lien on a client’s property. This raised a red flag to me. Later, when I became counsel to HGAR and its Professional Standards Administrator, this issue became far more disconcerting.</p>
<p>Under the Code of Ethics, Article 1 states, “When representing a… client as an agent, Realtors pledge themselves to protect and promote the interests of their client. This obligation to the client is primary….” Simply stated, a Realtor cannot put his/her interests above those of the client. Filing a lien on a client’s property is clearly putting the agent’s interest in getting paid above those interests of the client selling their property and is a blatant violation of the Code of Ethics. What’s worse, with a lien on the property, the agent may cause serious impediments for the homeowner and their transaction, and, in some cases, the homeowner may not be able to close.</p>
<p>Not only is filing a lien a violation of the Code of Ethics, but it’s not even permissible by law. In 2012, the Supreme Court of New York County held that, In the Matter of the Application of 1564 SECOND REALTY LLC, that a broker could not place a mechanics lien on a property. The court, in dismissing the broker’s lien cited Lien Law § 2 (4) and noted that a “real estate broker may only lien a property when it has performed an improvement… on Petitioner&#8217;s property.&#8221; Lien Law § 2 (4) defines “improvement” as, inter alia: “the performance of real estate brokerage services in obtaining a lessee for a term of more than three years of all or any part of real property to be used for other than residential purposes pursuant to a written contract of brokerage employment or compensation.” That means a broker in a residential transaction can never file a lien on the homeowner’s property. It’s simply not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Provision One: Attempted Resolution of Commission Disputes</strong></p>
<p>So, if filing a lien on a homeowner’s property is impermissible and a violation of the Code of Ethics, what can a broker do to ensure they get paid their commission? Well, the first line of defense is the OneKey MLS Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement (“OneKey Agreement”). In its current form, under paragraph 14, the contract requires that the homeowner shall deposit the commission monies into an escrow account and then try to resolve the matter through agreement, through arbitration, through a court order, or some other process which the parties agree to in writing. If the parties fail to resolve this matter, then the broker can look to the Commission Escrow Act for support.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Provision Two: Commission Escrow Act</strong></p>
<p>The Commission Escrow Act was signed into law in 2009. Its purpose is to protect brokers when a client refuses or indicates that they are not going to pay their commission and it makes things a little easier for the broker to collect. The act’s necessary language required under the law is in the OneKey Agreement (currently under paragraph 14). It reads as follows in bold typeface:</p>
<p><strong>At the time of Closing, you may be required to deposit the broker’s commission with the county clerk in the event that you do not pay the broker his or her commission as set forth herein. Your obligation to deposit the broker’s commission with the county clerk may be waived by the broker.</strong></p>
<p>Under the Commission Escrow Act, after the party’s failure to amicably resolve the matter, the broker must file an affidavit (which requires specific information such as commission owed, broker license number, property address, etc.) with the clerk of the county where the property is located before the deed is delivered to the buyer. The broker then provides notice of the filing to the homeowner and the homeowner’s attorney (if known) within five (5) days of the filing. The homeowner is then required to deposit the commission money with the county clerk. If the homeowner fails to deposit the money and the broker brings an action and it is determined that the broker is entitled to the commission, the broker will also be awarded costs and attorney’s fees; this is an incentive to compel the homeowner to deposit the money with the clerk.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the broker must bring suit within sixty (60) days of the money being deposited. However, keep in mind that if neither the broker nor the homeowner commences an action within the required time period, then the homeowner will be entitled to an order directing a return of the deposit.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to note that this process neither places a lien on the property nor impedes the transaction from taking place; therefore, the broker avoids violating the Code of Ethics and is not filing an invalid lien on the property.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The OneKey Agreement provides various provisions that assist a broker in obtaining their well-earned commission, including arbitration, possible court involvement, and finally the Commission Escrow Act. A broker must ensure that when the listing agreement is being reviewed by the homeowner (and possibly the homeowner’s attorney), these provisions are not crossed out; they are there to protect the broker. Short of an amicable resolution, the Commission Escrow Act serves as a backstop to provide some leverage to a broker whose commission was wrongfully withheld by temporarily diverting a portion of sales proceeds due to the homeowner to the county clerk’s escrow account.</p>
<p>To ensure that the provisions of the Commission Escrow Act are followed correctly and timely executed, you should consult with an attorney at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—A consensus of real estate and finance experts predicted that a recession is likely in 2023 as the Federal Reserve will continue to hike rates this year to battle rising inflation.</p>
<p>The experts were part of a virtual panel discussion held on Sept. 7 hosted by Fordham University’s Real Estate Institute and The Business Council of Westchester (BCW). The panel entitled: “Economic Outlook and Forecasting the New York Region’s Real Estate Market” featured Kathleen Corton, CEO, CIO and managing partner, Hillcrest Finance LLC; Eamonn D’Arcy, professor of International Real Estate, Henley Business School, England; Christopher Deutsch, vice president, China CITIC Bank International Ltd.; Charles Dougherty, vice president and economist, Wells Fargo; Timothy M. Jones, CEO, Robert Martin Co.; and Nicole LaRusso, senior director for research and analysis, U.S. North Region, CBRE Group Inc. The panel was moderated by BCW President and CEO Dr. Marsha Gordon.</p>
<p>Dougherty said that Wells Fargo believes the Federal Reserve will likely raise rates by 150 basis points in the next year and that there is a 60% probability the U.S. will go into recession sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>“Interest rates are going to continue to rise and that’s going to slow down activity across the economy, which is likely to have a big impact on commercial real estate,” said Dougherty. “Higher interest rates are one thing, but when you have demand for commercial properties slow considerably, that is going to slow down rent growth and cut into property valuations.”</p>
<p>Dougherty added a recession is likely in 2023 and will further impact the commercial sector, particularly hospitality in New York City which is waiting for international tourism to come back. “A very strong U.S. dollar coupled with a recession and probably an even more pronounced downturn in Europe is going to have a big impact on New York’s hotel market,” he said.</p>
<p>D’Arcy offered dire predictions on inflation across the Atlantic in Europe, noting, “The Bank of England, in August, was talking about inflation peaking next year at 13%. We’re currently at 10.1% and a prediction from Goldman Sachs suggests we could hit 22%, which is horrendous, by sometime next year.”</p>
<p>Corton, of Hillcrest Finance discussed how different property types are being impacted in the current economic climate. “I look at it two ways—what happens on the revenue side and what has happened with the cost of capital,” Corton said. “For multifamily, rents are up across the board. Very positive news on the top line, but the cost of capital has gone up as well. So, values on multifamily are down, not by a lot, but they’re down. Office values have gone down a lot, and it’s very difficult to refinance. Industrial, fundamentally, is very strong and probably the darling of the capital markets.”</p>
<p>Deutsch, of China CITIC Bank, also is seeing decreasing capital on the debt side, and explained how banks are addressing interest rates and reserves for construction loans. “Banks decrease debt levels by using an interest reserve or calculated interest reserve for a construction project, so they know they’re getting paid over the course of the loan,” he said. “They calculate that reserve and step it up every six months or year, based on their models. Now, we’ve gone from a quarter point to the Fed saying step it up three-quarters of a point. A lot of reserves are being recalculated and borrowers are being asked to fund it … that sucks capital out very quickly.”</p>
<p>The panel also shared insights into remote-work trends and how that is reshaping real estate. CBRE’s LaRusso said that, pre-pandemic, the average office worker spent about 4.2 days a week in the office. Now she expects it will be 3.2 days. “The reduction in time spent in the office, combined with current economic uncertainty and higher costs for occupiers, is going to push back on office demand in the near term,” she said.</p>
<p>In terms of the workers return to the office, the panel seemed to agree that the five-day work week at the office is far off.</p>
<p>Henley Business School professor D’Arcy said that in London, “We’ve discovered people are in the office on Wednesdays, and also Fridays because they like socializing.”</p>
<p>“Understanding the way people are living, working and spending their leisure time is important not just for commercial real estate, but for the way we develop our programs at the Fordham Real Estate Institute,” said Dr. Anthony R. Davidson, dean, Fordham University School of Professional and Continuing Studies. “How we live is changing, and education must continually evolve to meet those changes.”</p>
<p>Those changes also bode well for Westchester, said Gordon, noting that there is “a real opportunity to capitalize on the shifting needs of people and businesses.”</p>
<p>“The hybrid work format presents great growth potential for developers, banks and other businesses in Westchester County to lead the way in ensuring our infrastructure, transportation, working and living spaces are adaptable to the new type of work/lifestyle,” Gordon said.</p>
<p>Jones, of Robert Martin, noted the industrial sector benefitted from the e-commerce boom and multifamily profited from the work-from-home shift. Office and retail/entertainment spaces were heavily impacted, he said, but both are rebounding. “Office space has changed enormously, especially space that people have to commute to,” he said. “Office space in New York City is physically about 40% occupied now. In Westchester, our industrial spaces are fully occupied, but office remains at pre-pandemic levels, which is a relatively stable 20% vacancy level. Retail is doing better, and multifamily continues to be very strong.”</p>
<p>“The good news for Westchester was that many of those who left (NYC) didn’t go far,” said LaRusso. “Many found themselves in Westchester and other parts of the suburban tri-state market. As a region, we did a decent job of holding onto our workforce and we saw that play out a little bit in leasing activity in suburban markets.”</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors was a contributing sponsor of the program.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Just over a year ago, on Sept. 1, 2021, New York City and surrounding areas were severely affected by Hurricane Ida. In just a few hours that day, unprecedented flash flooding caused horrible death and devastation. The flooding caused by Ida took the lives of 29 people in New Jersey and 16 people in New York City. In New York City, 11 of the individuals died in illegal basement apartments. Sadly, it has been over a year, and very little has been done to address the problems so clearly made evident in the wake of Ida. While there has been no specific legislation introduced, there has been some movement.</p>
<p>On Aug. 30, 2022, the Office of the New York City Comptroller issued an extensive report entitled “Bringing Basement Apartments into the Light” [see https://on.nyc.gov/3L7HCRO] in an attempt to bring the focus back on this critical issue and move forward with the introduction of potential legislation at the city and statewide levels. New York City and the surrounding areas have long had problems with illegal basement apartments, which number in the tens of thousands. With the hurricane season upon us again, it is imperative that state and local leaders act quickly before another tragedy strikes. Findings in the New York City Basement Report estimate that there are between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals living in illegal apartments throughout New York. It is critical for homeowners, tenants, real estate agents, real estate attorneys, and other real estate professionals to be aware of the dangers and the potential liability that exists in connection with these illegal apartments. It is also important that they support legislation in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Restrictions Relating to Accessory Dwelling Units, Basements and Cellars</strong></p>
<p>As explained in the press release issued by the New York State Comptroller’s Office [see https://on.nyc.gov/3TWfK7z], “an Accessory Dwelling Unit is a smaller, independent residential dwelling located on the same lot as another building, in which one of the units is the primary residence of the owner of the building.” An owner may apply for a legal ADU provided the appropriate zoning codes are followed and appropriate applications and permits are obtained.</p>
<p>The press release further explained that “a cellar is a story in which 50% or more of the height from finished floor to ceiling is below the street grade and a basement is a story in which 50% or more of the height from finished floor to ceiling is above the street grade.” Under New York State’s Multiple Dwelling Law  apartments are strictly prohibited in “cellars,” however, provided all other regulations and zoning requirements are met, apartments in “basements” are permitted. Therefore, it is important that a regulatory framework be enacted to ensure a path for these illegal basements to become legal and safe for tenants.</p>
<p><strong>The Potential Risk and Liability Faced by Real Estate Licensees</strong></p>
<p>Real estate agents must be careful when listing apartments or properties for rental or sale. Liability could extend to real estate licensees who knowingly rent illegal apartments to tenants. Under Section 175.25(b)(9) all “advertisements shall include an honest and accurate description of the property to be sold or leased.” According to guidance (“DOS Guidance”) [see https://bit.ly/3tOBC83] issued by the New York State Department of State, Division of Licensing, licensees must make a reasonable effort to verify the legal status of the properties marketed and are required to disclose a property’s illegal status to potential purchasers or tenants.</p>
<p>According to the DOS Guidance, “where a broker has actual knowledge that a property lacks a permit or is otherwise illegal (i.e., illegal conversion), such information must be affirmatively disclosed. This requirement is found squarely within the department’s powers to discipline a licensee for: ‘dishonest or misleading advertising, or [where such licensee] has demonstrated untrustworthiness or incompetency.’ NY RPL § 441-c.” The DOS further stated that “it is a well-established rule that the department is ‘vested with broad discretion in imposing punishment on real estate licensees who have demonstrated untrustworthiness, and the exercise of that discretion will not be lightly disturbed.’” Ultimately, the DOS has broad powers to issue substantial fines and revoke real estate licenses if it found that licensees knowingly sold or rented properties containing illegal apartments.</p>
<p><strong>The New York City Basement Report</strong></p>
<p>The New York City Report is an important first step toward much needed action and legislation. One important issue highlighted by the New York City Basement Report is that the dangers affecting tenants are not solely limited to flooding, but also include fire, carbon monoxide and other similar dangerous events. The New York City Basement Report Executive Summary explains:</p>
<p>“While Ida’s heavy rainfall was unprecedented, and far beyond what the city’s sewer system was built to handle, climate change is accelerating the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events—so Ida will not be the last flash flood that puts the lives and homes of basement-dwellers at risk. Meanwhile, fires remain an even more frequent deadly risk for New Yorkers living in basement apartments. And the risk of eviction for basement-dwelling households, who have no tenant protections at all, presents its own potential disaster.”</p>
<p>It is imperative that the introduction of legislation be prioritized in order to limit the loss of life, as well as introduce additional critical protections. Inaction is unacceptable, especially where the lives of individuals are at risk.</p>
<p>The New York City Report points out that most of the tenants who inhabit these illegal apartments are minorities, immigrants, and those in the lower-income levels of society. The New York City Report further explains that illegal apartments “exist within an informal rental market due to regulatory and financial barriers, [and] currently house tens of thousands of New Yorkers, especially working-class immigrants and people of color.” Many of the homes containing illegal apartments are owned by lower income and minority owners who have limited access to the capital necessary to make improvements to these illegal apartments. The New York City Report’s Executive Summary emphasizes that as “the housing crisis has grown, New York City and State have struggled—and mostly failed—to ensure tenant safety, to navigate conflicts between owners and basement-dwellers, or to provide a predictable system that could attract capital for improvements.”</p>
<p><strong>Summary of the Newly Proposed ‘Basement Resident Protection Law’</strong></p>
<p>The New York City Report proposes that New York State adopt statewide legislation creating the new “Basement Resident Protection Law.” The proposed law would provide “immediate physical and tenant protections to New Yorkers living in basement units, with clear rights and responsibilities for basement owners and dwellers, as part of a more comprehensive approach to legalizing and expanding accessory dwelling units.” As outlined in the New York City Report, the proposed law will address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Basement Board reflective of the diverse constituencies affected to administer the program and financial support, develop inspection regimes and enforce the provision of services and tenant protections;</li>
<li>Require owners to register all currently occupied basement and cellar units with the Basement Board (resident protections would not be contingent on registration);</li>
<li>Ensure robust, language accessible outreach to occupants in basement and cellar units to promote awareness of the new program;</li>
<li>Mandate and provide funding to owners for the installation of basic safety measures, including carbon monoxide and smoke detectors and backflow preventers, to mitigate flooding risks during severe rain events like Hurricane Ida;</li>
<li>Establish basic rights and responsibilities for basement-dwellers and owners, including the requirement to provide basic services and the legal right to collect rent;</li>
<li>Immediately protect basement-dwellers from harassment, eviction, and the denial of essential services, and create new pathways for proactive enforcement and better occupancy data for the implementation of early flood warning systems;</li>
<li>Provide a registration framework that supports and is coordinated with ongoing safety inspections and legalization efforts; and</li>
<li>Require the city and state to provide affordable housing to New Yorkers living in units deemed to be so unfit for living due to egregious fire safety, habitability and flood risks that they must be vacated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed law focuses on the protection and safety of both tenants and owners. It is important that any legislation must not only prioritize the safety of the tenants inhabiting these illegal basement apartments, but it must also provide homeowners with support and funding to bring these illegal apartments into compliance. Such legislation will allow homeowners, who do not currently rent their basement apartments, to bring those apartments into compliance and to offer them for rent, which will ultimately alleviate some of the existing housing shortages.</p>
<p><strong>Creation of a ;Basement Board’</strong></p>
<p>As part of the proposed law, the New York City Report recommends that a new “Basement Board” (similar to New York City’s Loft Law) be created where “Owners of buildings with occupied basement and cellar apartments would be legally obligated to register their units by a certain date and all occupants living in a basement or cellar apartment, regardless of whether the owner had properly registered the unit, would receive certain rights.” The New York City Report recommends that the new legislation and Basement Board be patterned after New York City’s Loft law and Loft Board.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would provide owners with a temporary legal status for basement and cellar apartments for five years. The legislation would also include “Community outreach, technical assistance support and financial benefits…” and the Basement Board “would notify and create incentives for owners to register their units while deadlines for compliance and ability to levy fines would provide enforcement power to the city, if necessary.” Some of the areas that would be the focus of the proposed law and administered by the Basement Board are: (1) Outreach; (2) Safety Inspections; (3) Rights and Responsibilities of Owners and Occupants; and (4) Technical and Financial Assistance for Owners.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach</strong></p>
<p>As detailed in the New York City Report, the Proposed Law would require New York City and New York State “to fund local community-based organizations to conduct language accessible outreach to both owners and occupants living in buildings with basement and cellar apartments to inform them of their obligations and rights.” New York City and New York State would also be responsible for and fund “widespread outreach and notification, such as advertising in subway lines that serve the neighborhoods in which the majority of the ADUs are located, television, radio and print ads, participation in Community and Borough Board meetings, among other forms of outreach.”</p>
<p><strong>Required Safety Inspections</strong></p>
<p>New York State and New York City would also be required to commence widespread inspection efforts and determine whether there are dangerous conditions and whether any existing illegal basement apartments need to be vacated immediately. The Basement Board would begin to immediately develop “flood and fire risk profiles, both for the prioritization of inspections and for the determination of habitability following the physical inspection of the unit.” The New York City Report recommends that those areas that are subject to flooding concerns be inspected first. If it is found that a basement or cellar apartment is not habitable and an immediate vacate order is issued, the tenant would then be provided with housing vouchers and assistance to locate replacement affordable housing. A homeowner, under the proposed legislation, would also receive assistance such as “referrals to trained homeownership counselors who would provide financial counseling and work to secure financial assistance for the homeowner, if needed after the loss of rental income.” Assistance to both the tenant and owner is critical.</p>
<p><strong>Rights and Responsibilities of Owners and Occupants</strong></p>
<p>An important element of the proposed legislation would require owners to register with the Basement Board. If an owner fails to register, the owner would be subject to fines and enforcement actions. According to the New York City Report, owners would be required to install and/or provide the following services:</p>
<p>A smoke and carbon monoxide detector: Fire safety was the primary concern for basement and cellar ADUs prior to Hurricane Ida, so it is essential that these units have these minimum protections put into place.</p>
<p>A backwater protection valve (also known as a back flow preventer valve): A backwater valve can help prevent sewer water from rising from the city sewer into basement and cellar ADUs. The back water protection valve closes and blocks sewer water from entering the unit.</p>
<p>Essential services: Provision of heat, hot water, and electricity to tenants on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>There will also be financial assistance made available to owners from New York City and New York State in connection with the above services. The report provides that the “Basement Board could also require additional safety measures, such as flood sensors or fire suppression technology, especially as new or improved technology is developed.”</p>
<p>Another important component of the legislation is that registration of an illegal apartment by the owner “would confer the owner the right to collect rent, and the right to legally pursue an eviction for non-payment of rent or other nuisance behavior in violation of the terms of the lease.” Further, tenants would be entitled to a lease and would receive all of the protections afforded a tenant under the law and in connection with applicable eviction proceedings. Tenants would also have the right to report owners for lack of heat, water, electricity and other essential services.</p>
<p><strong>Technical and Financial Assistance for Owners</strong></p>
<p>Owners would receive important technical and financial assistance under the Proposed Law. When owners register an illegal apartment, they “would be eligible for fine forgiveness related to penalties for past illegal use of a basement or cellar should they exist, and first access to funding and technical assistance for the installation of the emergency safety measures.” Owners who register and apply for financial assistance first, will receive priority standing for financial support. Further, the proposed law would provide that “any low-income homeowners, regardless of the timing of their registration, would be entitled to technical assistance and financial support from the city, state, and/or community-based partners.” A critical focus of the legislation will be to assist homeowners in legalizing their apartments within the five-year period.</p>
<p><strong>The Industry Must Push for Legislation That Protects and Supports Tenants and Owners</strong></p>
<p>It is important that all real estate professionals and the real estate community come together and support legislation that protects tenants and supports homeowners in making these illegal apartments safe, habitable, and legal. It is important for real estate agents to inform both landlord and tenant clients of the dangers of renting illegal apartments. Owners who rent these illegal apartments must be made aware of the extensive problems they could face when it is time to sell their properties. Illegal apartments could potentially cause extensive delays in the closing process, as well as termination of the contract due to these issues. Exposure to liability is great and this should be stressed to owners who rent and market real property for sale or lease.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Moderated by Leah Caro, Co-Chair of HGAR’s Legislative Committee, the panel included the mayors of White Plains, New Rochelle and Yonkers, as well as the Supervisor of the Town of Cortlandt.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Affordable housing, commercial development, energy resources and community safety were among the issues discussed recently at a live “Meet the Mayors” panel held by the Women’s Council of Realtors on Sept. 12 at HGAR’s headquarters in White Plains.</p>
<p>Moderated by Leah Caro, Co-Chair of HGAR’s Legislative Committee, the panel included the mayors of White Plains, New Rochelle and Yonkers, as well as the Supervisor of the Town of Cortlandt.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Becker, the newly-elected Town Supervisor for Cortlandt, noted that the Village of Buchanan and hamlets of Montrose and Verplanck have always offered more affordable housing options in Westchester County. In addition, the town is reviewing the possibility of a 250-unit rental development on land in the northwest corner of Cortlandt.</p>
<p>New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said the city is continuously adding new housing and earmarking a percentage of all new developments for affordable housing. “There’s still a great undersupply of housing in Westchester,” he said, “and purchasing a home can be a big challenge for first-time home buyers.”</p>
<p>White Plains Mayor Thomas Roach echoed Bramson’s concerns. “Like New Rochelle, we’re seeing a lot of new rental units going up in our city and making certain that there are portions allotted for affordable rents,” he added. “The bigger communities are certainly doing their share, but there are some other Westchester communities who are not as involved with these efforts.”</p>
<p>Mike Spano is the Mayor of Yonkers, the third largest city in New York. “Keeping housing affordable is a difficult issue to deal with and we are working hard to maintain a good share of affordable housing so that people who grew up here can still stay here,” he said.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of preserving green space in Westchester’s cities, Mayor Spano revealed that plans are on tap for a new three-acre park along Warburton Avenue in Yonkers. Mayors Bramson and Roach also agreed that keeping open space is essential for attracting people to their cities.</p>
<p>To concerns about crime rates, Spano reported that Yonkers’ crime rate is down so far this year. “Of course, this doesn’t mean we don’t have crime—especially in a city as large as Yonkers,” he said. “But compared to other cities about the same size—such as Rochester—our crime rate is way lower.”</p>
<p>Reminding everyone that White Plains is the county seat, Mayor Roach indicated their crime rate is also on the decline. “As county seat, we’re always the venue for protests of some sort. We’ve had 45 to 50 of them last year and had no arrests or injuries,” he added.</p>
<p>While the crime rate is always typically lower in suburban areas like Cortlandt, Dr. Becker reported that the town has hired Community Resource Officers to work with the town to enhance safety and security.</p>
<p>Concerning future commercial development, Dr. Becker disclosed that the Cortlandt Town Center on Cortlandt Boulevard (Route 6) is more than 90% occupied. “There are plans currently in place for a new business to take over the old Shop Rite on Route 6, as well as development of the former Quarry area by the Hudson River for outdoor entertainment and a restaurant,” he noted.</p>
<p>Mayor Bramson indicated that in New Rochelle, commercial development is still lagging behind the city’s booming residential development. “We’re all very confident that it will catch up because with 15,000 new people who have money to spend, businesses will see the opportunities,” he said. There are already a number of new restaurants and coffee shops opening in the downtown area.</p>
<p>Mayor Roach touted the continuing emergence of new storefronts along Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains and Mayor Spano agreed on the same for Downtown Yonkers. “In fact, this year is the 30th Anniversary of Riverfest in our downtown, as we continue to grow and redevelop our downtown,” Mayor Spano noted.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="attachment_42246" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42246" class="wp-image-42246" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Haggerty-Richard-2019.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-42246" class="wp-caption-text">HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty</p></div>
<p>WHITE PLAINS—Richard Haggerty, who has been serving the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and its predecessor organizations for nearly four decades, informed the HGAR Board of Directors earlier this month that he will be leaving the organization at the end of this year to take over as Chief Executive Officer of its subsidiary organization, OneKey MLS, beginning on Jan. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Haggerty who has served as CEO of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors since 2012, will take over the CEO position at OneKey MLS from the retiring Jim Speer. OneKey MLS officially announced Haggerty’s appointment on Sept. 20.</p>
<p>Since OneKey MLS’s inception, Haggerty has served as OneKey MLS’s President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer. Along with Speer, Haggerty was instrumental in the creation of OneKey MLS, the New York metro area’s first regional multiple listing service. Launched with the Long Island Board of Realtors in 2018, OneKey MLS has more than 45,000 subscribers and serves Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Orange, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.</p>
<p>In his letter to the HGAR Board of Directors on Sept. 12, Haggerty said, “It is with very mixed feelings that I advise you that I will be transitioning to a new position on Jan. 1, 2023, and will become the CEO of HGAR’s subsidiary organization, OneKey MLS, LLP. I don’t make this decision lightly. I have had the privilege of working for HGAR and its predecessor organizations since 1984 and have forged countless friendships and lasting relationships over those 38 years. However, I also recognize that the MLS is the lifeblood in the daily lives of our member Realtors, and I believe I can be truly impactful in this new position, making a difference for all Participants and Subscribers of OneKey MLS.” Haggerty said that he would work with the HGAR Board in its search for his successor.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/viewpoints/gateway-perspectives-getting-back-to-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gateway Perspectives column</a> in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, Haggerty noted, “I have thought long and hard about how I can best serve the members, and where I could be most impactful, and I decided that path was OneKey MLS, which is the lifeblood in the daily lives of our members. Approximately four years ago we came together with the Long Island Board of Realtors to leverage the incredible geography of New York City and the greater suburban areas to create something that will really benefit our members and also benefit our consumers. We have accomplished much in the last four years, and there is much more to do to achieve our goals.”</p>
<p>HGAR President Anthony Domathoti said, “Richard Haggerty has led HGAR for the past 30 + glorious years. Starting with the 2009 merger and creation of the Westchester/Putnam Association of Realtors, the birth of HGAR and his appointment as CEO in 2011, the merger with the Rockland Board of Realtors and the Orange County Association of Realtors in 2012, the 2016 merger with the Manhattan Association of Realtors, and the 2020 merger with the Bronx/Manhattan Realtors, Richard continually strengthened HGAR and forged HGAR into far reaching communities in the Hudson Valley, Bronx, and Manhattan.”</p>
<p>He continued, “Although I am sad to see Richard Haggerty leave HGAR, I’m excited about his leadership with OneKey MLS and there are more goals for him to accomplish there. Richard has been integral to the all-round growth of our association, our members and affiliates creating and setting course for the first-ever Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee in 2021. A leader like Richard doesn’t come around every day. His ability to make every team member feel valued is an irreplaceable quality. He is one of the pillars that held HGAR up. I’m fortunate to have been able to work with him, and I wish him all the very best in the future. I thank him for everything&#8230;He will be missed.”</p>
<p>Domathoti in an e-mail message to HGAR members on Sept. 20, said, “I wanted to let our members know that your Executive Team has taken immediate action to establish both a CEO Search Committee and a succession process to ensure the smooth and successful transition of our association leadership.”</p>
<p>During his tenure as HGAR CEO, Haggerty led the organization to significantly grow its geographic reach throughout the northern suburbs and into the Bronx as well as initiatives geared at promoting Diversity Equity, and Inclusion at HGAR.</p>
<p>After the Westchester County Board of Realtors merger with the Putnam County Association of Realtors in 2009 that created the Westchester/Putnam Association of Realtors, he oversaw WPAR’s merger with the Rockland County Board of Realtors and the Orange County Association of Realtors that created the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors in 2012. In January 2017, HGAR merged with the Manhattan Association of Realtors, creating an HGAR Manhattan Chapter, and in 2020 HGAR merged with the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors to create the Bronx Chapter of HGAR.</p>
<p>The veteran Realtor executive first worked at the then Westchester County Board of Realtors in 1984 as a temporary employee. After three weeks he was offered a job as the Director of Membership Administration and over the years he worked in other departments including Professional Standards and Multiple Listing Service. He was appointed Deputy Executive Officer in 2004.</p>
<p>Haggerty is a national expert in Professional Standards administration and training. He is a Certified Administrator and frequent speaker at training programs of the Association Executives Institute of the National Association of Realtors. He holds a BA in English from the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>He has been an active instructor for the National and New York State Association of Realtors and over the years has also been an instructor for the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon and U.S. Virgin Islands Associations of Realtors. He has served on numerous committees, including the Professional Standards Committee and the Association Executives Committee of the National Association of Realtors, as well as numerous committees of the New York State Association of Realtors. He is a graduate of the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>“After completing a comprehensive search process for Jim’s replacement, we were pleased to have determined Richard to be the best individual to assume the leadership of OneKey MLS,” said Linda Lugo, chairperson of the OneKey MLS Board of Managers. “From its inception, Richard’s unwavering commitment to the success of our organization and his understanding of the vital role the MLS plays in real estate, makes him uniquely qualified to lead OneKey MLS through the next phase of our development that is centered around growth.”</p>
<p>OneKey’s Speer added, “Richard is a remarkable leader who has been responsible for a big part of our organization&#8217;s success over a short period of time. I am confident that Richard will ensure that OneKey MLS will continue to evolve under his direction.”</p>
<p><strong>Speer Announces Retirement</strong></p>
<p>On Sept. 14, OneKey MLS announced that CEO Speer will retire at the end of this year. Speer has been at the helm of OneKey MLS from its inception, guiding one of the largest Multiple Listing Services in the country to its continued success.</p>
<p>For more than the past 30 years he served as the Senior Vice President of Operations for the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. For the last three years he was named to the Swanepoel Power 200 list, the definitive ranking of the residential real estate industry’s 200 most powerful and influential leaders throughout the country, in addition to receiving other prestigious industry awards.</p>
<p>Lugo, Chairperson of the OneKey MLS Board of Managers, said, “Like many of my colleagues I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Jim on so many endeavors that have resulted in friendship. I will miss Jim and feel continued gratitude for his tireless efforts.”</p>
<p>“Jim was part of the vision of OneKey from the very beginning, and he did a tremendous job launching OneKey MLS during one of the most challenging times in our history when COVID was overwhelming our region,” said Haggerty. “He is one of the most highly-respected MLS executives in the country and he leaves very big shoes to fill, to put it mildly. I look forward to leading OneKey MLS in the next chapter of its growth.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Existing-home sales in the Northeast grew 1.6% from July to an annual rate of 630,000 in August, down 13.7% from August 2021. The median price in the Northeast was $413,200, an increase of 1.5% from the previous year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-U.S. home sales experienced a slight dip in August, marking the seventh consecutive month of declines, according to a report released today by the National Association of Realtors. Month-over-month sales varied across the four major U.S. regions as two regions recorded increases, one was unchanged and the other posted a drop. On a year-over-year basis, however, sales fell in all regions.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast grew 1.6% from July to an annual rate of 630,000 in August, down 13.7% from August 2021. The median price in the Northeast was $413,200, an increase of 1.5% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, notched a minor contraction of 0.4% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.80 million in August. Year-over-year, sales faded by 19.9% (5.99 million in August 2021).</p>
<p>“The housing sector is the most sensitive to and experiences the most immediate impacts from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate policy changes,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The softness in home sales reflects this year&#8217;s escalating mortgage rates. Nonetheless, homeowners are doing well with near non-existent distressed property sales and home prices still higher than a year ago.”</p>
<p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of August was 1,280,000 units, a decrease of 1.5% from July and unchanged from the previous year. Unsold inventory sits at a 3.2-month supply at the current sales pace—identical to July and up from 2.6 months in August 2021.</p>
<p>“Inventory will remain tight in the coming months and even for the next couple of years,” Yun added. “Some homeowners are unwilling to trade up or trade down after locking in historically-low mortgage rates in recent years, increasing the need for more new-home construction to boost supply.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $389,500, a 7.7% jump from August 2021 ($361,500), as prices ascended in all regions. This marks 126 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record. However, it was the second month in a row that the median sales price retracted after reaching a record high of $413,800 in June, the usual seasonal trend of prices declining after peaking in the early summer, NAR officials stated.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 16 days in August, up from 14 days in July and down from 17 days in August 2021. Eighty-one percent of homes sold in August 2022 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in August, consistent with July 2022 and August 2021. NAR&#8217;s 2021 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released in late 2021—reported that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 24% of transactions in August, the same share as in July, but up from 22% in August 2021.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in August, up from 14% in July and 15% in August 2021.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented approximately 1% of sales in August, essentially unchanged from July 2022 and August 2021.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—Now in his third term of office, Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus is looking beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to the future of Orange County.</p>
<p>Neuhaus, at a recent meeting of the Alliance for Balanced Growth, did not hold back and offered his frank assessment of the economy and what he believes is the proper use of federal government financial incentives.</p>
<p>Based on his sometimes blunt comments there, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> felt it had to sit down once again to get County Executive Neuhaus on the record on those and other key issues.</p>
<p>A life-long Orange County resident, Neuhaus and his two sisters were raised on a working farm in Southern Orange County that is still operational today. He attended Monroe-Woodbury High School and took courses at SUNY Orange during his senior year. Neuhaus went on to receive a Bachelor Degree in History/Political Science from Mount Saint Mary College as well as a Master Degree in Public Administration from Marist College. He is also a graduate of Orange County’s Leadership Orange program.</p>
<p>Neuhaus recently was promoted to the rank of Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserves effective Oct. 1, 2022. Neuhaus became a commissioned Officer in the Navy in December of 2007. He served on active duty earlier this year in Europe with the U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Sixth Fleet is the Navy&#8217;s operational fleet and staff of the U.S. Naval Forces in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>He was previously on active duty with the U.S. Navy from November of 2018 to June of 2019. During that time, he served with the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force, spending most of his deployment in various locations throughout Iraq in Support of Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military campaign against ISIS. The County Executive also served overseas in South Korea in 2017 and North Africa in 2011.</p>
<p>Neuhaus, a Republican, was sworn into office on Jan. 1, 2014 after having served as the Town of Chester’s Supervisor for six years. He ran unopposed and was elected into his third term of office as county executive  in November 2021.</p>
<p>He lives in Chester with his wife and four children.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> At a recent meeting of the Alliance for Balanced Growth, you said that the county plans to use its surplus, mostly COVID relief funds from the federal government, for infrastructure spending and perhaps a tax cut for taxpayers. Can you elaborate on the amount of funding you plan to earmark for infrastructure and some of the projects to be funded as well as other specifics of your plan?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-42279" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NeuhausSheriffsDeputies.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="272" />Neuhaus:</strong> So, we are doing phenomenally well financially and our surplus is coming from two sources. If we never got the ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) money we would have been completely solid in this county. That’s how good (financially) we are doing thanks to conservative budgeting and a lot of great sources of income, much of that being sales tax. A lot of counties balance their budgets on property tax. However, because we are so big on economic development with companies like Medline and tourist destinations like LEGOLAND New York, we are bringing in close to $5 million in motel tax alone. So, we have two big pots of money we have surplus monies in—one is sales tax and the other is ARPA.</p>
<p>Some counties are using ARPA money for social programs and things like that. For the most part, all of my ARPA money is going towards infrastructure. We have $75 million coming in. We are going to put in at the end of the day about $20 million for a new Medical Examiner’s office and also all sorts of other major infrastructure projects. We also have a massive amount of sales tax (revenue). I am talking tens of millions of dollars in sales tax surplus. My unrestricted fund balance is close to $200 million at the end of this year. I have an $830-million budget so that is a ton of money. So, what are we doing with it? Tens of millions of dollars are being allocated to paving our roads. We’re doubling the number of miles we are doing this year. We are spending money on culverts and bridges. Basically, what we did is I brought in my DPW and Parks Commissioners and asked: ‘What is on our to do list that we are not doing right now? Usually, that is what you put into your capital plan and say we’ll borrow and we’re going to get this road done in five years and we’ll do this (job) in two years and buy equipment. A big part of (this plan) is we are going to buy new dump trucks and other heavy equipment that we use for DPW to do work in-house. You are going to see tens of millions of dollars in sales tax alone going towards whether it be physical infrastructure improvements or buying the equipment and maintaining that equipment in-house.</p>
<p>With the rest of the money, I am doing a major budget presentation at the end of the month and we are going to do a major (property) tax cut. We have to because there is so much money coming in because in my opinion if you are not using it for county services or county infrastructure, it’s got to go back to the taxpayer and that is what I am going to be announcing on Sept. 28 (Neuhaus public budget presentation). … When I present my budget in a couple of weeks you are going to see some massive infrastructure projects listed on it, you are going to see a property tax cut for the taxpayers, and I am thinking a significant one in the tax levy and the tax rate. You will also see less debt. We are paying cash for stuff. So, if you have this money why borrow when you can pay in cash?</p>
<p>We are also looking at major development of parks. We are redoing every one of our playgrounds. So, if you have a child that is autistic or a child in a wheelchair or a grandma or grandpa that has limited mobility, let’s make the park accessible to everybody. … We are also going to add 10 miles to the Heritage Trail heading out towards New Windsor that is going to open up economic corridors for bicycle shops and ice cream shops and businesses like that.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Would the more prudent policy be to set some of those surplus funds aside for reserves since some economists are predicting a possible recession in 2023?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> Definitely. I am an optimist at heart, a proud American. I still believe we are the best house on a bad block. The whole world is a little upside down with war, (high) oil prices, inflation, you name it. However, I have to run a government. I have to be a little Nostradamus in the future and be able to predict where the economy is going to go. If it goes bad, am I going to have surpluses? So, we are beefing up our surpluses as high as we can go in every account. We will have the maximum amount (of reserves) we can have in there just in case. I always have believed in a rainy-day fund. God forbid we have another pandemic or we get sucked into World War III in the Pacific or with Russia. I spent a lot of this year either out in the Pacific monitoring the Chinese expansion in the entire Pacific, not just the South China Sea, as well as with first-hand knowledge in Europe that can easily suck us into a crisis and the U.S. is front and center in both of those theaters.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Recently, you unveiled a plan to turn the former Camp LaGuardia property in Blooming Grove and Chester into a public park. From what we understand, there were some interested buyers in several RFPs issued by the county. Can you explain why you choose to reject those proposals and the rationale for making the former men’s homeless shelter complex a public park?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> In May, I grabbed all our department heads, including our new County Attorney Rich Golden who I think is one of the best municipal attorneys in the Hudson Valley if not the state…, and we sat in a big conference room with the bids. Every one of the three bids was contingent on approvals of the local communities and was also contingent on sewer and water, which does not run with the land. When Camp LaGuardia was shut down in February 2007, the Town of Blooming Grove petitioned to have the sewer rights removed. Now we are at a sewer crisis and shortage in a part of Orange County and with getting a pocket (sewer) plant approved by the New York State DEC, as well as finding water sources and getting them approved in a timeline that these three bidders needed on it, the (County) Attorney recommended to the Chairperson of the Orange County Legislature (Katie Bonelli) and I that we would never get this approved. You are going to be dealing with this for three, four, five years before you see the first penny. We then presented it to the legislators and the majority of the legislators said we would rather see a park there. We don’t have a park in southern Orange County. Let’s go with that concept. … I was all set going into that meeting that I was going to pick one of the three bidders, but then when that was presented to me that you are not going to see this in your term as County Executive or the next term that made me think we have to do something with it. Listen, I run by it every morning, including this morning. It looks like a site for &#8220;The Walking Dead.&#8221; So, I have instructed my staff to just start maintaining it and cleaning it up right now in anticipation of us owning it for the near future, which it looks like we would have owned it no matter what we did with it. But, as a good military commander, I keep every option open.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With the opening of LEGOLAND New York, and tourism becoming a more significant part of the county’s economy, is the planned expansion of Route 17 a key project for the future of Orange County and its future growth?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> It is not only key; it is vital and required. What I am disappointed about is that I am still hearing from New York State it is going to be three years of studies (before construction could begin). Three more years of studies before you even start to see a plan and then you are going to have to fight for more funding to get that plan implemented. I think New York State gets an F+++ in infrastructure maintenance and it is one of the biggest impediments of economic development besides their aggressive anti-business platforms in the DEC and their lack of putting any real money forward for really good economic development projects.</p>
<p>Their lack of maintenance in infrastructure is a disaster—(Route) 17M is an embarrassment. We just spent a half hour talking about where I am putting my extra money, the state is giving it away like candy to social programs that do little to help anybody. They should be putting their money into infrastructure, safe streets, safe neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> noted that Gov. Hochul has committed $1 billion to the Route 17 expansion project. Neuhaus then responded:</p>
<p>I want to see asphalt being put down. I don’t want to see studies. That road has been studied for 60 years. … They just finished doing some major upgrades on it. All they need to do is just add a third lane in there. I am happy they are talking about doing something with it. I am very skeptical that I now have to wait another three years of studies to actually see anything done. So, anybody reading your newspaper right now is going to say, ‘I am not going to see anything for the foreseeable future.’ That is frustrating. … This thing is like “Sasquatch,” it’s like urban folklore that there is going to be a third lane on Route 17.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> While COVID is not over, are there any lessons to be learned from how government, and particularly your administration, handled the fight against the spread of the pandemic?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-42283" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/neuhaus-.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" />Neuhaus:</strong> … While everybody gets some type of pass because they never had seen this before in this generation, however, I think that Main Street got beat up by Wall Street. What does that mean: the Main Street businesses were forced to close and big businesses like Walmart and Target stayed open, which were vital services, people needed to get key goods in order to survive. But, I think that we can look at this and approach this a lot differently and prioritize not only public safety and public health, but also the continuance of economic growth and letting people work. And I think businesses adapted themselves too. People had to come up with websites so that people could order online.</p>
<p>I think going forward, we need to make economic development and the continuance of economic vitality a priority at the same time as public health. I think we were very restrictive. I think the damage it caused to schools, kids and education and socialization was a big deal. …</p>
<p>Every 911 call in the county gets sent to me. Last night we had a suicide, we’ve had people jump off the Mid-Hudson Bridge, suicide numbers are through the roof. The District Attorney (David Hoovler) and I are talking about addiction issues. So, there are a lot of negative impacts that came out of COVID and we need to make sure that if we had something like that impacting us again, we approach it in a different way.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[ American companies are on pace to reshore, or return, a record number of jobs to the United States. One key question arises: How do we, as economic developers, seize the global opportunity to compete for high-value manufacturing projects?]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Globalization has long impacted the location decisions of manufacturing firms; many have decided to locate overseas over the last 20 years. Fast forward to 2022—global pandemics, geopolitical uncertainty, and heightened supply chain risks have complicated economic development and location decision making.</p>
<p>As documented in a recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-companies-on-pace-to-bring-home-record-number-of-overseas-jobs-11660968061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal article</a>, American companies are on pace to reshore, or return, a record number of jobs to the United States. One key question arises: How do we, as economic developers, seize the global opportunity to compete for high-value manufacturing projects?</p>
<p>In the book, “Agents of Economic Development,” authors Neal Wade and Dr. Bill Smith famously coined: “If economic developers are not thinking 10 years ahead, then they’re already falling behind.”</p>
<p>Recognizing the global trends in reshoring, federal investment in manufacturing through the CHIP’s (“Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors”) Act, and renewed state-wide enthusiasm for manufacturing—we’ve rolled out a new initiative called the Site Inventory Program (SIP).</p>
<p>This initiative is multifaceted, with a key focus on identifying sites and communities that have the infrastructure to accommodate what we call “Strategic Sectors,” consisting of the food and beverage processing, life sciences/pharma, and clean energy manufacturing clusters. In essence, we’re working to reverse-engineer the site selection process—uncovering which communities currently have the infrastructure to site manufacturing projects, and which communities will have the infrastructure in the future.</p>
<p>In a time of heightened risk mitigation in industrial real estate and site selection, Orange County has remained a magnet for speculative industrial investment—with millions of square feet of speculative development in varying stages of the entitlement process. There’s an important message in this phenomenon—the market fundamentals of Orange County are strong and resilient. The proliferation of spec buildings means industrial tenants have an opportunity to enter a highly sought-after market with a degree of speed and predictability that many communities struggle to offer.</p>
<p>As the world around us continues to change, the Orange County Partnership remains uncompromised in our vision to create high-paying, value-added jobs in Orange County. We’re laying the groundwork for the next 10 years through the SIP, while marketing our growing list of spec buildings to companies who are ready to make the move to Orange County.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[In recent years, at the former Platinum Mile suburban office corridor in Harrison and White Plains along I-287, developers have torn down or rebuilt underutilized office properties for multifamily and retail uses.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>HARRISON—The continued adaptive reuse and redevelopment of office properties along the Platinum Mile and particularly in a section in Harrison called the “Teardrop Neighborhood” continues. In recent years, at the former Platinum Mile suburban office corridor in Harrison and White Plains along I-287, developers have torn down or rebuilt underutilized office properties for multifamily and retail uses.</p>
<p>Recently, two family-owned development firms have presented plans to the Town of Harrison to redevelop the former 347-room Renaissance Hotel property into a multi-phased project that will include up to 760 rental apartment units and retail space.</p>
<p>The “Renaissance Harrison” project, which has been estimated to cost approximately $400 million to develop, will involve the demolition of the former hotel and the construction of two residential quads—the North Quad and South Quad—two large gathering spaces to be known as the Commons and the Mansion, and two sets of triplex villas. Neither phase will exceed 380 units, with a mix of one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom luxury apartment homes, many with terraces.</p>
<p>The development team, consisting of Rose Equities and Garden Communities, stated that the community’s architectural design “will celebrate Westchester County’s classic Tudor and Arts &amp; Crafts structures.” Proposed luxury amenities include indoor and outdoor swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts, fire pits and an outdoor amphitheater, which will be available for the public.</p>
<p>The Renaissance Harrison development will continue the transformation of the “Teardrop Neighborhood” that already includes Toll Brothers’ Carraway multifamily development, Wegman’s supermarket and Life Time Fitness at the former Journal News property.</p>
<p>The 28-acre development will feature multiple four- and five-story buildings and villas with mostly below grade parking.</p>
<p>The Renaissance Westchester Hotel closed during the COVID pandemic and permanently closed in the fall of 2021.</p>
<p>“The proposed 28-acre community will be unlike any other development in Westchester. It will adhere to 21st-century standards of walking and biking, sustainability, and respect for the property’s outstanding natural landscape,” said Leonard Glickman, principal of Rose Equities. The Harrison Planning Board recently voted unanimously to declare its intent to serve as the Lead Agency for the environmental review of the Renaissance Harrison site plan application.</p>
<p>He said the project, if approved, would add to the emerging “live work play&#8221; environment of the Teardrop, which is surrounded by I-287, the Hutchinson River Parkway, and I-684.</p>
<p>The owner-builders intend to preserve and renovate a 1905 Normandy-style mansion on the property (commonly known simply as “The Mansion”) that was the former home of architect John Merven Carrere. His firm Carrere and Hastings was one of the nation’s leading Beaux-Arts proponents and its highest-profile project was the New York Public Library in Manhattan. The development is intended to promote walkability and biking, Glickman noted.</p>
<p>The new community will be designed by nationally and locally prominent firms, including Perkins Eastman, Moore Ruble Yudell, Sasaki and Studio Valerius.</p>
<p>Renaissance Harrison, when completed, is expected to generate approximately $30 million in annual tax revenue for the Town of Harrison and the Harrison Central School District.</p>
<p>“Renaissance Harrison makes sense for the Teardrop neighborhood. In 2013, the Town of Harrison adopted an updated Master Plan that envisioned a mix of new uses in the Teardrop, including multi-family residential,” said Glickman.</p>
<p>Glickman said the developers are contract purchasers for the Renaissance Harrison property. While the hotel will be demolished, the plan calls for the retention of the mansion, which will be used for community-oriented events if the plan is approved.</p>
<p>He added that there will be two distinct community gathering places—the Mansion and the Commons—as well as seven to eight acres of minimally disturbed wooded areas for biking and trail walking in the northwest quadrant of the property located south of Wegmans. The property will have a connector road to Wegmans.</p>
<p>When addressing the scope of the project with the total of 760 rental apartment units, Glickman noted, “One has to put that into context,” he told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. “If you look at the Toll Brothers’ site immediately to our north, they have 450 units on seven or eight acres. The Trammel Crow project will also have 450 units. On a per-acre basis, they are somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 (units) while we are down to 27.”</p>
<p>California-based Rose Equities, together with their long-term partner Garden Communities of Short Hills, NJ, have acquired, entitled, and are developing nearly 5,000 units of best-in-class sites in Orange and Los Angeles counties, California. Their joint venture continues on the East Coast with The Residences at Main, a 260-unit luxury apartment home community, currently under construction in the Fairfield County town of Trumbull, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Garden Communities owns and manages more than 50,000 apartments and more than 25 million square feet of retail, office and hotel space. Garden Communities, and its subsidiaries, offer home rentals in Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Garden Communities and Rose Equities stated they expect to own Renaissance Harrison for multiple generations.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The real estate market in the lower Hudson River Valley and greater New York City suburban area continued to be battered by chronic low inventory, rising interest rates and persistent inflation during the third quarter of 2022. However, even given these adverse conditions, resiliency and consistent buyer demand are still evident, especially when compared to the pre-pandemic market of 2019. While total transactions were down from the previous year, median sales prices continue to increase throughout the market, driven in large part by low inventory, OneKey MLS reported.</p>
<p>Realtors and consumers also are likely experiencing a return to a more seasonal market, which disappeared during the latter half of 2020 and the entirety of 2021, according to the<strong> <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2022-3rd-Quarter-Report-Final.pdf">2022 Third Quarter Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx counties</a> </strong>authored by OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>In Westchester County, third quarter single-family home sales of 2,006 declined 15.6% compared to the third quarter of 2021. However, when compared to the third quarter of 2019, single-family home sales in Westchester were up 3.4%. Condo sales in Westchester for the third quarter of 2022 decreased by 24.5% and co-op sales were on par with the previous third quarter. The single-family median sale price of $872,000 posted a 2% increase over last year, the condo median sale price of $460,000 was slightly down, and the co-op median sale price of $204,500 was 2.3% higher than the previous year.</p>
<p>In Putnam County, single-family home sales of 326 were down 10.7% compared to the third quarter of 2021, but when compared to 2019, the number of sales were almost identical. The median sales price of $505,000 was 8.6% higher than the third quarter of 2021. Rockland County likewise experienced a drop in transactions, with single-family home sales down 9.2% and condo sales down 15.8%. However, when continuing the comparison to the third quarter of 2019, the 2022 third quarter numbers were slightly ahead. The single-family median sales price of $660,000 for the third quarter of 2022 in Rockland County was 14.2% higher than 2021.</p>
<p>In Orange County the third quarter single-family home sales total of 1,019 was down 14% over the 2021 third quarter, and the condo sales number of 138 was off an even steeper 23.3%. The single-family home median sales price was up 9.1% at $420,000 and the median condo sales price of $270,950 for the third quarter was a 13.4% increase over the 2021 third quarter. In Sullivan County the single-family sales number of 300 transactions was just slightly higher than the 298 total of the previous year and the median sales price was up more than 10% when compared to the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Shifting closer to the city, the Bronx market continued to show signs of strength, in the third quarter of 2022, with single-family home sales ahead 9.2% over the third quarter of 2021. The median sales price of $630,000 was 6.8% ahead of last year. However, condo sales lagged from the previous third quarter.</p>
<p>As we have stated in previous sales reports for 2022, there will continue to be challenges in comparing sales numbers to the pandemic year of 2020, when the market came to a grinding halt in the second quarter, and the post-pandemic market of 2021, when pent up demand drastically sped up typical buying cycles.</p>
<p>Given the grim drumbeat of negative economic headlines and the ongoing debate of will there or won’t there be a recession, it’s obvious that the market will not be immune to such significant headwinds. However, the third quarter sales numbers do not necessarily support the doom and gloom forecasts that many prognosticators like to make, especially when making comparisons to the pre-pandemic market of 2019. Also, the strong labor market seems to be playing a role in counterbalancing some of the adverse economic factors. As was the case at the end of the second quarter, the wild card in this analysis is a potential recession in 2023, and the length and depth of one should it occur. Until then, the numbers support a conclusion of a resilient real estate market that is hampered by low inventory, but still supported by strong buyer demand.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[New York Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed today what was first reported in Real Estate In-Depth, that the study of the $1-billion Route 17 expansion will take another three years to complete and that construction on the expansion project could not begin at least until then.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—For those who were wondering if construction on a third lane on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties would come sooner or later, the answer unfortunately for project advocates is later.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed today what was first reported in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, that the study of the $1-billion Route 17 expansion will take another three years to complete and that construction on the expansion project could not begin at least until then.</p>
<p>In an announcement earlier today marking what the governor called a “Major Milestone on Transformative Conversion of State Route 17 into Interstate 86,” she stated that the environmental review process on the project has begun. Much later in the announcement, she did state that the New York State Department of Transportation expects to publish a final Environmental Impact Statement for the project in 2025.</p>
<p>In an interview with Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus in the September edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, the county executive complained that state officials had told him the environmental review would take three years to complete. Attempts to get a comment from NYSDOT officials were not successful at the time. Neuhaus told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, “I want to see asphalt being put down. I don’t want to see studies. That road has been studied for 60 years.” He later added, “This thing is like ‘Sasquatch,’ it’s like urban folklore that there is going to be a third lane on Route 17,” he said.</p>
<p>Project advocates had hoped that the environmental review would be expedited since the New York State Department of Transportation had conducted an extensive Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) study on Route 17 and recommended the state move forward with environmental reviews on one of two options to build a third lane from Harriman in Orange County to Monticello in Sullivan County. The PEL report was released in November 2021 and in April, Gov. Hochul announced her commitment to fund up to $1 billion towards the Route 17 expansion project.</p>
<p>The governor today announced work has begun on a Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the upgrade of the roadway to interstate standards, with public outreach and involvement efforts expected to begin in early 2023. The launch of the environmental review process follows the inclusion of up to $1 billion in the recently adopted State Capital plan to accelerate the conversion of the highway to interstate standards and add a third lane.</p>
<p>“As we continue to improve our infrastructure across the Empire State, we are laser-focused on delivering smart projects like this monumental investment in the Mid-Hudson region that maximize impact on regional economies,” Gov. Hochul said. “The Route 17 Draft Environmental Impact Statement kicks off this transformative project, which will enhance tourism, economic competitiveness and quality of life for residents and visitors alike. The Mid-Hudson region is a jewel of the New York State and with this project we are helping this region not only meet, but exceed its future potential.”</p>
<p>The DEIS will involve a full federal NEPA environmental assessment of alternatives starting with those identified as reasonable in the Final PEL Report, looking at issues such as air quality, wetland impacts, and environmental justice. Among the alternatives to be screened will be the inclusion of such features as the addition of a third lane, interchange improvements, bridge replacements and enhanced park-n-ride facilities, including expanded capacity and EV charging.</p>
<p>The governor reported that NYS DOT is also progressing contract plans to complete Stage II of the Exit 122 interchange project in the Town of Wallkill in Orange County to enhance the westbound ramp system.</p>
<p>The project, which will complete the westbound portion of the interchange  in the Town of Wallkill and also reconstruct a portion of eastbound State Route 17,  is expected to be let in January 2024. The scope of the work includes the widening of the bridge over the Wallkill River to allow for full acceleration/deceleration lanes and the possible addition of a third lane to the highway. The NYS DOT said in a prepared statement that as the project is still in the design phase, it is premature to discuss costs.</p>
<p>New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “This environmental review process for the Route 17 conversion is an important step forward that will help us improve one of the busiest travel corridors in the state and bolster an economic lifeline for the surrounding communities.”</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Neuhaus in a prepared statement included in the governor’s announcement, stated, “Improving Route 17 is important to the economy of our region, and I look forward to seeing continued state investment in our region&#8217;s transportation network. The expansion of State Route 17 into Interstate 86 will allow us to continue to market this economically vital corridor for growth and sustainable development.”</p>
<p>Sullivan County Manager Josh Potosek said, “Route 17 has long been the backbone of Sullivan County and our primary connection to the rest of New York State. I thank Governor Hochul and the State Legislature for devoting funds and attention to completing the long-awaited conversion to Interstate 86. We are a growing county in a fast-growing part of New York, and the state&#8217;s enormous investment in Route 17 will ensure that growth is not strangled by inadequate infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The PEL report released last November recommended the state move forward with an environmental review of a General Use Third Lane in each direction on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties that could if built as one major project cost anywhere from $650 million to $1.27 billion. The PEL Study Group also called for a study of interchange upgrades to be undertaken at exits in Orange and Sullivan counties and that improvements be made in the region to improve connectivity to existing transit.</p>
<p>Representatives of the 17-Forward-86 coalition, which has been advocating for the construction of a third lane on Route 17, did not address the three-year environmental review, but instead hailed the news that the environmental review process had begun and that public outreach and involvement efforts are expected to begin in early 2023.</p>
<p>“We thank Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York State for making Route 17 a priority for investment,” said 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair Maureen Halahan, President and CEO of the Orange County Partnership. “We’re so encouraged to see the environmental review get underway, which will move this crucial project forward. These much-needed upgrades will improve mobility and safety in our region, and lay the groundwork for building a sustainable future.”</p>
<p>The 17-Forward-86 earlier this year hosted a rally in Middletown with local, state and federal representatives to urge Gov. Hochul and state legislators to commit construction funding as part of the New York State Department of Transportation’s capital plan by using some of the more than $5 billion in additional funding earmarked for New York under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Shortly thereafter, Gov. Hochul announced the state’s commitment of up to $1 billion for the Route 17 expansion project.</p>
<p>“Our region is growing, and we must ensure our roads can handle the added capacity now, and in the future,” said 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair Marc Baez, President and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership. “This is an important step forward in our efforts to enhance mobility on Route 17 and, in turn, improve safety for residents, first responders, businesses, visitors and all of those who travel this corridor. We’re grateful to our thousands of supporters and our elected officials who have been working to make this project a reality.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For those of you that don’t recognize the quote, it’s from <em>The Sixth Sense</em>. It’s a great movie and truly worth rewatching, especially now. Because we’re approaching Halloween, I thought I would revisit the concept of stigmatized properties and what are an agent’s duties to disclose.</p>
<p>Stigmatized properties come in many forms. The ones we most often hear of are homes in which someone was murdered, committed suicide, or there is a claim ghosts are present. However, there are many types. So, let’s look at those:</p>
<p><strong>Stigmas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Murder or Suicide Stigma</strong>—Obviously, this stigma exists when someone is murdered or commits suicide within the home. Many buyers fear that trauma can linger in a home, and in fact, a survey conducted revealed that 45% of American believe that ghosts and spirits can reside in certain places.</p>
<p><strong>Public Intrigue Stigma</strong>—People are curious. Public intrigue in a property can become a real nuisance to a homeowner. For instance, Walter White’s home in the series <em>Breaking Bad</em> is overrun with gawkers. The site of a sensational crime can also draw fans. The <em>Amityville Horror</em> home is just such a place. Tourists, fans, and “lookie-loos” walking, driving, taking pictures, trespassing, etc. can severely disrupt a homeowner’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Paranormal Activity Stigma</strong>—We’re all familiar with this one. Ghosts in the attic, monsters in the basement, or other supernatural or paranormal activity. Realtor.com conducted a survey and learned that 49% of homebuyers would not consider moving into a haunted house.</p>
<p><strong>Criminal Stigma</strong>—Some buyers care if a home was used during or for the commission of a crime. Did they sell drugs from the home? Did they make drugs in the home?</p>
<p><strong>Debt Stigma</strong>—If the prior homeowner had lots of debt, the new homeowner may receive tons of unnecessary mail, solicitations, or be hounded by debt collectors trying to contact the previous homeowner.</p>
<p><strong>Minimal Stigma</strong>—Something that bothers a small portion of the public is called a minimal stigma. Some people have an irrational fear of terminal illnesses, even if it’s not communicable. Another example is a buyer purchasing a home where a known sex offender resides or is living nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure Duties</strong></p>
<p>In general, New York applies the “caveat emptor” rule, meaning “let the buyer beware” and the buyer has a duty to discover all the material defects that affect the physical attributes of the property and its value. New York Real Property Law §443-a, requires that a Realtor disclose any material defects to the property that the agent is aware of. This does not mean that a Realtor must be versed in all areas, such as mold, structural engineering, asbestos, water damage, etc., however, it does mean that if a homeowner or an expert has informed a Realtor of a material defect, they must disclose it.</p>
<p><strong>Is Death, Murder, Felony, or Disease a Material Defect?</strong></p>
<p>New York Real Property Law §443-a (1) specifically states that the following, whether suspected or actual, are NOT material defects to a property:</p>
<p>• location of a homicide, suicide or other death by natural causes;</p>
<p>• location of any crime punishable as a felony;</p>
<p>• where the prior owner or occupant carries a human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or any other disease determined by medical evidence to be highly unlikely to be transmitted through occupancy of a dwelling place.</p>
<p>Due to this provision, a Realtor has no duty to disclose most of the above stigmas, with a few exceptions. Those exceptions vary. For instance, as many of you know with the Ghostbusters case from Nyack, a homeowner and his/her Realtor must disclose that ghosts reside in a property if they are affirmatively identifying the property as having ghosts (the homeowner sold stories based upon the ghostly encounter in the home). Another exemption would be if the home itself was the cause of a tragedy. The condition of the property, if unresolved, should be revealed (for example, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a methamphetamine lab on the premises), as the condition may cause future health risks; however, the death or criminal activity does not need to be disclosed. However, generally, you do not need to disclose murders, suicides, drug dens, infamous places, whether a sex offender lives there or nearby, or if the debt collector is pounding on the door. You do not have to disclose that someone had cancer, AIDS, or any other disease that is highly unlikely to be transmitted through occupancy (COVID?), and you certainly do not have to disclose that there are things that go bump in the night.</p>
<p>If such information is important to the buyer, then the buyer may inquire by submitting a written inquiry for this information. If this request is presented to the homeowner, then the homeowner must decide whether or not to respond. As for the agent, they must follow the legal instructions of their client. If the client does not want to disclose that information, then the agent must follow that instruction. However, all Realtors must be aware that they must not misrepresent and say that such a condition does not exist. That would be a material misrepresentation and subject the agent to liability, possible loss of license, and a Code of Ethics violation.</p>
<p>A perfect example of this is if the prospective buyer asks if there is a sex offender living nearby. If an agent is asked if they have any such knowledge, they do not have to disclose it. But the agent cannot say that there are no sexual predators nearby if that is not true, as the agent would be making a false statement. So, the agent has three options: 1. Decline to answer; 2. Respond that registration of sex offenders is public record; or 3. Answer truthfully if authorized by his/her client homeowner.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The duty to disclose is specific and required. You must disclose any known material defects, meaning something physical that affects the value of the home. Ghosts, murder, suicide, and felony locations do not have to be disclosed. Same goes for debt collections, AIDS, or places that draw attention from the public. However, even though there is no duty to disclose, one question stands out—if a buyer or buyer’s agent finds out about the stigmatized property after they purchase it and they were unaware of its reputation, what will they do? The courthouses and Realtor professional standards hearing calendars are filled with cases where something was not disclosed. So, have that conversation with your client and decide if it’s better to disclose than not disclose. Sometimes, full disclosure is a good thing. You never know, some people will “kill” for the chance to live in a haunted house.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween!</p>

    <description><![CDATA[“Households now need to be earning about $200,000 per year in order to be able to afford just half the listings in the New York metro area,” revealed Nadia Evangelou, NAR Senior Economist & Director of Forecasting.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—At a recent webinar hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, a National Association of Realtors economist reported that affordability of homes in our region continues to slip. “Households now need to be earning about $200,000 per year in order to be able to afford just half the listings in the New York metro area,” revealed Nadia Evangelou, NAR Senior Economist &amp; Director of Forecasting.</p>
<div id="attachment_42426" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42426" class="wp-image-42426" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Headshot_Nadia.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-42426" class="wp-caption-text">Nadia Evangelou, NAR Senior Economist &amp; Director of Forecasting</p></div>
<p>Evangelou noted the average monthly mortgage payment in September 2021 was $2,100, compared to the September 2022 average payment of $3,360 per month. “That’s close to an extra $1,300 more each month,” she said. “Mortgage rates are significantly higher than in previous years and it definitely affects homebuyers, many who are paying up to 60% more.” NAR estimates more than 1.4 million New York metro households were priced out of the market this year.</p>
<p>Along with a panel of local real estate experts, Evangelou weighed in on the state of the market for the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023. Inflation, she stated is one of the main triggers of what’s happening in the housing market. “In August, for example, inflation rose much faster than expected, hitting 8.3%,” she said at the Sept. 22 online program. “Combined with the higher mortgage rates, the accelerating costs of gas, groceries and other goods are now forcing some people out of the market.”</p>
<p>Currently, rates are over 6% band Evangelou predicts they will stay in that range through the end of 2022. “While there has been a decline in home sales, I think prices will continue to increase but at a slower rate,” she said, explaining that housing inventory is still falling short nationwide.</p>
<p>While 2021 was the best year in the housing market across the nation, this year home sales have continued to drop for the last seven months. “We’re definitely seeing a slowdown in sales but not in prices,” Evangelou explained. “Our data shows that home prices rose by 7.7% nationwide for the second month in a row. Because of the severe housing shortage across the country, the prices will tend to remain stable because there’s not enough supply.”</p>
<p>Panelist Joseph Rand, Chief Creative Officer with Howard Hanna | Rand Realty in Nanuet, agreed. “We did hit a record in 2021, but you can’t really compare this year to 2020 and 2021 when sales were through the roof,” he said. “I think we need to compare current sales to the 2019 or 2018 markets and in that case, home sales are up in most areas of the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>Rand hesitated to use the word “recession.” “I don’t think we’re going to see anything like what we saw in 2008,” he added. Fellow panelist Jonathan Miller, President and CEO of Miller, Samuel Inc., Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants in Manhattan, agreed. “There’s really no way to accurately predict whether a recession is coming—it all depends on how the Fed continues to raise rates,” he explained. “Clearly, the momentum has been taken out of the mortgage industry due to doubling rates, but that, in turn, is pushing people into the rental market.”</p>
<p>Still, throughout the U.S, households rose by 7% from last year, according to recent NAR data. However, some major metro areas like New York lagged behind at just 6%. In New York City, Queens and Kings counties reported the fastest growth in the last decade at 8.5%, and New York County (Manhattan), at 8.3%.</p>
<p>Conversely, as compared to the rest of the country, the New York metro area has the fifth largest annual population decline. On a national scale, NAR found that 47% of the relocating population has been inbound to urban areas, but 53% were migrating to suburban or rural areas. “A lot has to do with the shift to remote working, which is five times larger than it was in 2019,” added Evangelou. “Those moving to suburban areas are also looking for larger homes.” In 2019, the average single-family home measured 1,580 square feet but in 2022, the national average is 1,900 square feet.</p>
<p>Currently, there are approximately 3.47 million renters in the New York metro region alone, and millions more throughout the nation. While married households may fare better with two incomes, NAR statistics indicate that only one in three renters are married. “With high rents, it becomes a challenge for single people to save money to eventually buy a home,” she noted.</p>
<p>Panelist Gabe Pasquale, Vice President of New Development, Christie’s International, NY Metro, believes the answer may lie in the development of additional single-family rental communities. “We haven’t seen a lot of this in the Northeast, but it seems to be growing in other areas of the country,” he said. “This will give younger people a new opportunity to have a single-family home. A lot of Millennials are now looking to change their urban lifestyle without being locked into buying something.<br />
”<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-42425" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rising-Mortgage-Rates.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" />In White Plains alone, where the average rents range from $1,800 to $2,200 for a one-bedroom, Pasquale said that situation is not giving people a lot of incentives. “If they are forced to continue renting at these prices, they’re not going to be able to save,” he added.</p>
<p>Miller added that while some rents are stabilizing, he doesn’t expect them to nosedive. “It’s hard to imagine rents coming down to more affordable levels, especially when the rental market is already very tight,” he acknowledged. “I do think that the single-family rental market and the newer ‘rent-to-own’ offerings will be big growth factors.”</p>
<p>Chintan Trivedi, panelist and real estate broker with RE/MAX In The City in the Bronx, believes the rental market will stay robust. “I do think Millennials are waiting on the sidelines and don’t want to commit to a 30-year mortgage at this point,” he said.</p>
<p>On the selling side, Rand’s concern is sellers who may not be able to afford to sell. “You’re usually going to spend more money when you’re looking to upgrade your home, but now factoring in the interest costs, many sellers have such good rates they don’t want to give up their current homes,” he said. “I think we have to find more creative ways for today’s sellers to be able to sell.”</p>
<p>As for the future, Rand cautions sellers and buyers against panicking. “We’re not going to see 2008 again when people who had no business buying a home could get a loan. We don’t have bad loans and a foreclosure boom today and prices are still up 30% from two years ago,” he said.</p>
<p>Miller echoed Rand’s sentiments. “Lenders are not losing their minds and mortgage underwriting conditions are much more conservative now,” he added. While Pasquale believes the fourth quarter of 2022 may not be a great one, he said the fact that there’s still a housing shortage will help to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is that buyers can’t make an offer that’s 20% below asking and expect to get it, but sellers shouldn’t reject a decent offer,” Rand noted.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Did you know that The Bronx is the oldest borough in New York City, or that it’s also home to the oldest golf course in the country—Van Cortlandt Park Golf Course? Historical sites are scattered throughout The Bronx as well, including the Edgar Allen Poe Cottage, Van Cortlandt House Museum, Woodlawn Cemetery and the culinary world-famous destination of Arthur Avenue.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, HGAR offered an Historic Bronx Tour event to its members, visiting seven sites and concluding at Enzo’s of Arthur Avenue, a long-time staple for homemade Italian delicacies. Close to 50 people boarded the bus for the two-and-a-half-hour tour.</p>
<div id="attachment_42434" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42434" class="wp-image-42434" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Edgar-Allen-Poe-House1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-42434" class="wp-caption-text">The Edgar Allan Poe House</p></div>
<p>“The tour was important to showcase a sample of the many wonders that exist in The Bronx,” said Eliezer Rodriguez, HGAR Director for the Bronx Chapter and tour organizer. “The Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the world and there’s no place more beautiful than the New York Botanical Gardens. In fact, The Bronx houses the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park, which is three times the size of Central Park!”</p>
<p>In addition, The Bronx includes Co-Op City, the largest housing complex in the nation with 15,000 apartments in 35 towers and three shopping centers. The world-famous Haagen-Dazs ice cream originated in the Bronx during the 1960s, and the borough has also been the birthplace of many celebrities including Ralph Lauren, Regis Philbin, Jennifer Lopez, Anne Bancroft, Calvin Klein and Penny Marshall.</p>
<p>More than 1.4 million people live in this 42-mile borough, which is now the third most densely populated county in the U.S. The Bronx is named for Jonas Bronck, a Scandinavian who settled in a Dutch colonial province in New Netherland in 1639. The borough was created in 1898 and became a county in 1914.</p>
<p>The Valentine-Varian House, dating back to 1758, was the first stop along the tour, conducted by Roger McCormack, Director of Education for The Bronx County Historical Society. The home has the distinction of being the oldest remaining farmhouse and the second oldest house in The Bronx. It survived the Revolutionary War and was occupied throughout the time by both American and British forces.</p>
<p>Woodlawn Cemetery, the next stop, opened during the Civil War in 1863 and at 400 acres, is one of the largest cemeteries in New York State. It is the final resting spot of more than 300,000 people including Rowland Macy, the founder of Macy’s Department Stores, James Cash Penney, the founder of JC Penny, composers Irving Berlin and George Cohan, musicians Miles Davis and Duke Ellington, former New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and many more.</p>
<div id="attachment_42436" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42436" class="wp-image-42436" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Valentine-Varian-House.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-42436" class="wp-caption-text">The HGAR tour outside the Valentine-Varian House</p></div>
<p>“Before the local population swelled, families would bury their deceased relatives in small family plots on their personal properties,” explained McCormack. “As the population grew, so did the need for larger cemeteries. Today Woodlawn is still a working cemetery but it’s also a beautiful setting for walks with a park-like experience.”</p>
<p>The Van Cortlandt House Museum is located on the grounds of the 1,000-acre Van Cortlandt Park, which was once the Van Cortlandt family’s plantation. Built in 1748, the estate was occupied by both the British and the Patriots and was host to General George Washington in 1776 and 1783.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th Century, the house was sold to the City of New York and became a museum in 1897. Today it’s a National Historic Landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>The fourth stop, the Bartow-Pell Mansion, can be found in the northern portion of Pelham Bay Park. Also, a National Historic Landmark, the mansion is said to have one of the nation’s best Greek Revival interiors. Built in 1654, the house was later enlarged, renovated and remodeled in the Federal style. It was sold to New York City in 1988 by descendants of the Bartow family and is used today for various programs or private events.</p>
<p>The Andrew Freeman home, the next stop, is the brainchild of the man who once owned the New York Giants and was also behind the construction of New York City’s subway. After Freeman’s death in 1915, he left behind a trust to build a retirement home for wealthy New Yorkers who had fallen on hard times. Today, this New York City landmark has been renovated and transformed into an artists’ hub, incubator space, workforce development and community services.</p>
<p>The Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, the sixth stop on the tour, dates back to 1812 and was the home of one of our nation’s greatest writers from 1846 to 1849. It’s in this cottage that Poe created some of his most memorable works including “Annabel Lee,” “The Bells,” and “The Cask of Amontillado.”</p>
<p>“I have two favorite places in The Bronx—The Poe Cottage and the Valentine-Varian House because they were both working men’s homes,” said McCormack. “Poe’s cottage, the author’s last permanent home, was originally built for farm laborers.” The cottage is currently undergoing renovations to the roof as well as landscaping updates.</p>
<div id="attachment_42433" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42433" class="wp-image-42433" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Arthur-Avenue.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-42433" class="wp-caption-text">Arthur Avenue in “Little Italy”</p></div>
<p>The last stop on the tour was the Arthur Avenue Retail Market, one of The Bronx’s most beloved attractions, spearheaded by former New York City Mayor LaGuardia. The Italian indoor food bazaar features nine restaurants, six bread stores, five pastry shops and delis, four butchers, three gourmet coffee shops, and two fish markets.</p>
<p>Enzo’s Restaurant, just across the street, hosted the HGAR tourists after the event with homemade spicy meatballs, rice balls, and other Italian delicacies. Located in the Belmont section of The Bronx, “Little Italy” has become home to thousands of immigrants from Italy and all over the globe. The area has also served as an inspiration for movies like “Marty,” “A Bronx Tale,” “The Godfather,” and “The Sopranos.”</p>
<p>“Of course, The Bronx itself is the home of the most famous baseball team in major league history, the New York Yankees,” added Rodriguez. A baseball fan for many years, Rodriguez’s favorite place in The Bronx is Yankee Stadium. “It’s always been a special place and most recently the Yankees clinched the 2022 American League East title!”</p>
<p>The Bronx County Historical Society is planning a Poe Birthday Celebration at Poe Cottage on January 19, featuring all-day tours of the house as well as performances by local poets. “I love doing tours—especially walking tours,” said McCormack. “It’s a great experience to educate people and I learn a lot as well from many of the residents who have lived here a very long time.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>While many real estate professionals are familiar with the concept of adverse possession, few consider the issues that can arise when selling and purchasing real property. The concept has been around for ages. In its basic form, the concept allows a person who takes possession of real property, makes improvements to it, possesses it in a public manner, and continues to do so for an extended period of time (10 years or more) continuously, to acquire an ownership interest in the real property.</p>
<p>Adverse possession may also be used to establish ownership rights to a specific tract of land even where a prescriptive or actual easement exists. In a recent decision, <em>CJA Realty Holdings, LP v 14 Phila St. LLC</em>, the Appellate Division, Third Department, deals with this very issue and whether an individual could establish adverse possession rights to a portion of the adjoining owner’s property where there existed an easement for egress and ingress. The case provides a useful review of the doctrine of adverse possession as well as the changes to law that occurred in 2008.</p>
<p><strong>The Current Adverse Possession Law Enacted in 2008</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, New York enacted critical changes to the adverse possession law under Article 5 of the Real Property Actions &amp; Proceedings Law (RPAPL) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3edAY0I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3edAY0I</a>]. Section 501 of RPAPL provides key definitions. Under Section 501(1) an “adverse possessor” is defined as a person or entity who or that “…occupies real property of another person or entity with or without knowledge of the other&#8217;s superior ownership rights, in a manner that would give the owner a cause of action for ejectment.” This means that an adverse possessor is an individual or entity against whom or which an owner could bring an action to evict. If the owner brings an action within the 10-year period from the point at which the adverse possession commenced, then an owner would be able to evict and remove the adverse possessor from the property.</p>
<p>Under Section 501(2) an adverse possessor will gain title to the real property in question upon the expiration of the 10-year statute of limitations “…provided that the occupancy…has been adverse, under claim of right, open and notorious, continuous, exclusive, and actual.” All of the aforementioned elements must be established before an adverse possessor’s ownership rights will accrue. One change from the previous law was that the 2008 amendment included a definition of “claim of right.”</p>
<p><strong>A Review of the Basic Elements of Adverse Possession</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, in order to claim title to the property, the adverse possessor must establish the following elements: (1) claim of right, (2) possession must be open and notorious, (3) exclusive, (4) continuous, (5) actual and (6) hostile.</p>
<p><em>Claim of Right— </em>Under Section 501(3) a “claim of right” is defined as “…a reasonable basis for the belief that the property belongs to the adverse possessor or property owner, as the case may be.” An adverse possessor must actually believe or be convinced that the adverse possessor has a legal right to the land being occupied. However, the “claim of right” element is not required if the owner of the real property throughout the 10-year period cannot be reasonably ascertained in the records of the county where the property is located.</p>
<p><em>Open and Notorious—</em>An adverse possessor’s possession of the real property must be “open and notorious.” This basically means that possession must be obvious and noticeable. It cannot be of a hidden or unknown nature. For example, if there is a use of hidden underground utilities, which are unknown to the owner, there would be no valid adverse possession claim.</p>
<p><em>Exclusive Use—</em>The adverse possessor must have exclusive use, control and occupancy over the property in question. A key component of the “exclusive” element is that the adverse possessor must never acknowledge at any time during the 10-year period that the property belongs to another person nor shall the adverse possessor allow the owner or any other person or entity to use and occupy the property. Once this occurs, the adverse possession claim will fail.</p>
<p><em>Hostile—</em>The “hostile” element is similar to other elements and is usually found to exist if all of the other elements above exist. It basically requires that use of the property must be without the consent or permission of the owner. If at any time during the 10-year period permission is sought to occupy, use or improve the property, that would immediately terminate a claim of adverse possession.</p>
<p><em>Continuous—</em>The adverse possessor must continuously occupy the property for the requisite 10-year period. The continuous element does not require that the person who initiated the adverse possession and occupancy of the property be the  same person who continues the possession for the 10-year period. If another person or entity, for example, a purchaser acquires  the adverse possessor’s property and continues to use that portion of the property, which was being adversely possessed for the 10-year period, the continuous element would be deemed satisfied, provided, however, that the property in question was part of that transaction. Continuous does not mean that the acts of adverse possession continue on a constant basis, but they must be repeated acts that are consistent with a claim of right and ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Key Changes from the Previous Adverse Possession Law</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, three notable changes were made to the adverse possession law, which had been in effect since 1962. The law added the definition of “claim of right” to Section 501(3) which is defined as <em>“a reasonable basis for the belief that the property belongs to the adverse possessor or property owner….” This change adds a reasonableness standard to the law.</em></p>
<p><em>Another important change had to do with the requirements of the type of possession engaged in by the adverse possessor. Previously, the law stated that </em><em>“land is deemed to have been possessed and occupied…[w]here it has been usually cultivated or improved.</em>” The prior standard was a more direct and objective one, which made it easier to establish adverse possession.</p>
<p>The revised Section 522 reads as follows: <em>“land is deemed to have been possessed and occupied…[w]here there have been acts sufficiently open to put a reasonably diligent owner on notice.” An adverse possessor’s actions must be more overt, and those actions must be able to “put a reasonably diligent owner on notice” of the adverse possession taking place. The changes were enacted to protect against those who attempted to engage in “adverse possession” by stealth methods or in bad faith, making it more difficult to establish ownership rights through adverse possession.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the new changes provide that minor nonstructural encroachments and maintenance activities are permissive and non-adverse. Section 543(1) provides that <em>“…the existence of de minimus non-structural encroachments including, but not limited to, fences, hedges, shrubbery, plantings, sheds and non-structural walls, shall be deemed to be permissive and non-adverse.” Further, Section 543(2) provides that “the acts of lawn mowing or similar maintenance across the boundary line of an adjoining landowner’s property shall be deemed permissive and non-adverse.”</em> Previously, there was always a fear that these minor issues could become an adverse possession and title issue.</p>
<p><em>CJA Realty Holdings, LP v 14 Phila St. LLC</em></p>
<p>In CJA Realty, the plaintiff and defendant (14 Phila St. LLC) owned adjoining real property. Another defendant owned and operated a restaurant and leased space from 14 Phila St. LLC. In 2017, the plaintiff sued the defendants seeking to enforce its right to use a 20-foot-wide easement for vehicular ingress and egress, which burdened the defendants&#8217; property. The plaintiff sought to have the defendants remove all structures from the purported easement area and keep the area free from any obstructions. The defendants counterclaimed against plaintiff and alleged that “a portion of the easement—namely, that portion which is enclosed by a fence and used for outdoor seating and dining—had been extinguished by adverse possession.” Plaintiff replied to the counterclaims and discovery ensued. The lower court granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants’ counterclaim. The defendants appealed the trial court’s decision to the Appellate Division.</p>
<p>The Appellate Division explained that “an easement created by grant may be extinguished by adverse possession if the party seeking to extinguish the easement established, by clear and convincing evidence, that its use of the easement was hostile and under a claim of right, open and notorious, actual, exclusive and continuous for a period of 10 years.” Therefore, the defendants must, by clear and convincing evidence (not merely a preponderance of the evidence), which is a much higher evidentiary standard, establish that all of the elements of adverse possession exist.</p>
<p>The court further explained that “a presumption that the use was hostile generally arises once all other elements of the adverse possession claim are established, thereby shifting the burden to the opposing party to demonstrate that the use was permissive.” Therefore, once all of the elements have been established by the defendants, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show that the defendants’ actions were permissive, which would defeat the “hostile” element. In <em>CJA Realty</em>, the defendants did present evidence that one of their predecessors-in-interest had fenced in the area in question in 1995. To counter, the plaintiff also submitted evidence that the defendants’ actions were made with the consent of the prior owners.</p>
<p>The Appellate Division, however, held that while the defendants “made a prima facie showing that their predecessors&#8217; use of the disputed portion of the easement was actual, open, notorious, exclusive and continuous for the prescriptive period, defendants&#8217; own submissions raise[d] a question of fact as to whether use of the easement for enclosed outdoor seating and dining was permissive and under a claim of right.”</p>
<p>The Appellate Division further held that the plaintiff’s evidence presented at the lower court level relating to the issue of permissiveness was also not sufficient to warrant a dismissal of the defendants’ counterclaim at the summary judgment stage. In essence, the court decided that the parties had to go back to trial regarding these issues. The area of adverse possession is heavily fact-dependent. Before a court decides whether or not to award an adverse possessor an ownership right to all or part of a parcel of real property, it will require that all of the facts and evidence be presented to establish whether all of the elements of adverse possession exist.</p>
<p><strong>A Practical Guide for Dealing With </strong><strong>Potential Adverse Possession Issues</strong></p>
<p>Almost every real estate transaction involves a potential adverse possession claim. As is evident in <em>CJA Realty</em>, the issue would have clearly become a roadblock if the defendant chose to sell the property. Any purchaser would have likely included in the contract of sale the right to use the enclosed area for outdoor dining. The placement of fences and structures on an adjoining property are the most common issues that arise in a real estate transaction. While the current law excludes minor or “de minimis” encroachments, such as fences, shrubs, non-structural walls, and the like, often times a fence or enclosure encroaches upon or cuts off access to a substantial portion of a property.</p>
<p>Real estate agents and real estate attorneys should always request or attempt to obtain copies of surveys to properties early on. If fences, walls, or other potential encroachments exist, a survey can be useful in determining any potential issues. Sellers will usually have a survey from their original purchase of the property. Surveys may also be found at the building department of the town in which the property is located.</p>
<p>Additionally, when real estate agents visit the property, it is useful to make notes of any structures or improvements, as well as any walkways or paths that extend beyond the property, as these could be evidence of the presence of a prescriptive (non-written) or express easement, and any structures that exist at the property. Often surveys do not include dirt pathways or walkways and making a note of these items and advising the buyer and the buyer’s attorney could go a long way in helping protect the buyer.</p>
<p>In the event a survey cannot be located prior to signing the contract of sale, the purchaser’s attorney should include language in a rider that provides the purchaser with the right to obtain a survey and to cancel, if any issues arise should the seller not be able or willing to clear any such issues. Since the enactment of the 2008 changes to the adverse possession law, it is customary for purchaser’s attorneys to include the word “minor” wherever the contract of sale refers to permitted exceptions and/or encroachments which a purchaser must agree to accept and to include language that specifically defines “minor” as any encroachment that is 12 inches or less.</p>
<p>It is also recommended, if possible, that an affirmative obligation of the seller to obtain a boundary line agreement be included in any purchaser rider. The boundary line agreement will normally contain acknowledgements that the adjoining property owner makes no adverse possession claim or claim of right to any portion of the property and that said use and occupancy is permissive. While this may be difficult to obtain or include in a rider, if the seller agrees and is successful in having the adjoining property owner deliver a boundary line agreement or acknowledgment, the buyer may proceed with the closing even where a substantial portion of the property may be blocked off or fenced in because the title company will usually insure ownership rights of the purchaser.</p>
<p>Survey, encroachment, and adverse possession are basic “title issues” that come up often, and if the seller is unable to deliver good, marketable and insurable title to property free from these issues, a purchaser should have a right to terminate the transaction and receive a refund of the contract deposit. A basic knowledge of these issues goes a long way in protecting the ownership rights of both purchasers and sellers.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Bronx saw record dollar volume and the second most single-family home transactions ever recorded with $1.54 billion spent over 189 transactions. These were slight increases over the second half of 2021 and significant increases year over year. The overall increase in activity is an indication of the upside and opportunities found in the Bronx.</p>
<p>The real estate market in the lower Hudson River Valley and greater New York City suburban area continued to be battered by chronic low inventory, rising interest rates and persistent inflation during the third quarter of 2022. However, even given these adverse conditions, resiliency and consistent buyer demand are still evident, especially when compared to the pre-pandemic market of 2019. While total transactions are down from the previous year, median sales prices continue to increase throughout the market, driven in large part by low inventory. We also are likely experiencing a return to a more seasonal market, which disappeared during the latter half of 2020 and the entirety of 2021.</p>
<p>The Bronx market continued to show signs of strength, in the third quarter of 2022, with single-family home sales ahead 9.2% over the third quarter of 2021. The median sales price of $630,000 was 6.8% ahead of last year.</p>
<p>The median sales price for condos in the third quarter of this year was $309,000, which was slightly ahead by 3% over the third quarter of 2021. The median sales price for co-ops was $255,000, a 4.1% increase over the third quarter of 2021. The ultifamily sales price stood at $822,500 with a 6/1% increase over the third quarter in 2021.</p>
<p>The average rent in the Bronx has increased in October. Over the past month, the average rental price in the neighborhoods  increased by 1.76% from $2,220.95 to $2,260.00. Studio rental pricing increased by 0.02%, from $1,943.99 to $1,944.34. The average rental price for a one-bedroom unit increased by 2.68% from $2,089.34 to $2,145.26. The average rental price for a two-bedroom unit increased by 2.32%, from $2,629.51 to $2,690.39.</p>
<p>The most expensive studio, one, and two-bedroom units were all seen in Mott Haven. Conversely, the most affordable studio and two-bedroom units appeared in Morris Heights/University Heights and one-bedroom units in Concourse/Highbridge.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, while the overall outlook for New York City real estate is more uncertain than it has been in recent years, The Bronx remains positive as it continues to be one of the most affordable areas of the city. With colossal infrastructure projects underway in the region, and the upcoming rezoning along Jerome Ave., The Bronx should continue to draw investment, all but guaranteeing near and long-term price growth in the borough.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The controversial Bruckner Boulevard rezoning proposal that was supported by city leaders and labor unions, but was opposed by some community advocates, including Community Board 10, was passed unanimously by the New York City Council on Oct. 12 by a 48-0 vote.</p>
<p>The approval is a victory for New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who supported the proposal that will make way for an affordable housing project that will create 349 homes—including 168 rent regulated homes—in the neighborhood of Throggs Neck in the Bronx. The project includes 99 homes reserved for seniors, 25 homes that will be made available to veterans in need, and a new supermarket.</p>
<p>A key to the project’s approval was when project opponent Council Member Marjorie Velázquez signaled her support for the rezoning prior to the City Council’s Land Use Committee vote on Oct. 6.</p>
<p>“Throughout this process, I have maintained a commitment to prioritizing the needs of my district and local neighborhoods,” said Council Member Velázquez. “We are in the middle of a citywide housing crisis that is similarly felt by residents of my district, with seniors and working people facing strains to remain in our neighborhoods. The updated project voted out of the council’s committees today delivers significantly deeper affordable housing for our community, more good jobs for residents, and additional benefits for the neighborhood. This provides tangible benefits for the people of our community and transforms the unfortunate reality that this office before me had been unable to provide affordable housing for our residents, with less than 60 units produced in the last eight years. We have far surpassed that in less than a year. I will never stop fighting for my local community and always remain committed to negotiating to the end to deliver for the people of my district.”</p>
<p>The Bronx Times reported that Community Board 10 was still opposed to the Bruckner rezoning after the full City Council vote. “We’ll deal with the hand we’re dealt with, but we were not supportive at all,” said Bronx Community Board 10 Chairperson Joseph Russo. “I don’t know what community the councilwoman (Velázquez) is speaking of, because the community was very adamant about their lack of support for this project—not only for the project, for the applicants.”</p>
<p>After the Land Use Committee vote earlier this month, New York City Mayor Adams said the vote was “a victory for the Throggs Neck community, the Bronx, and the entire city.”</p>
<p>He added, “This project will bring nearly 350 much needed homes—including affordable housing for seniors and veterans—to a neighborhood that has only added 58 affordable units in the last decade. Just as importantly, it is a sign that our city is once again embracing our identity as a ‘City of Yes.’ The housing crisis impacts all of us, and every community has a responsibility to be part of the solution and help us provide safe, quality homes to all New Yorkers. I’m proud to have been a vocal proponent of this project, and I look forward to working with the speaker and the entire City Council to advance citywide changes that will allow us to finally build the housing we so desperately need.”</p>
<p>“New York’s housing crisis is a citywide problem that requires a citywide solution, and we need to powerfully reject the NIMBYism that should have no place anywhere in New York City,” said Deputy Mayor for Economic and Workforce Development Maria Torres Springer. “We thank the City Council for their support of this project and leadership at a time when we need all New Yorkers to do their part in ensuring we see our way out of this housing crisis and move forward as a just and equitable city.”</p>
<p>Borough President Vanessa Gibson called the approval of the Bruckner rezoning proposal “a step in the right direction that will serve to provide affordable and permanent housing for Bronx families and New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>She noted that during the public hearing process on the proposal, her office hosted two days of hearings that garnered input and feedback from stakeholders, residents, advocates, and union members. Based on those sessions, the Bronx Borough President’s Office made recommendations that it believed could enhance the proposal while understanding the low-density residential community that families of Throgs Neck have experienced since 2004.</p>
<p>“We cannot ignore the housing crisis that our city is facing,” Gibson said. “Working-class families who are our essential workers and frontline staff deserve stable housing and will now have these opportunities in our borough.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>POUGHKEEPSIE—Two major company’s combined promised $120 billion in investments in New York State prompted President Joe Biden to visit the Hudson Valley earlier this month to tout the legislation that is driving this historic infusion of private capital—the $100-billion CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed by Congress earlier this year.</p>
<p>On Oct. 4, in what is believed to be one of the largest economic development projects in the nation’s history, Micron announced it is investing up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to construct a semiconductor manufacturing campus in Onondaga County, NY.</p>
<p>The project is to be built in Clay, a suburb of Syracuse. Micron’s first phase investment of $20 billion planned by the end of this decade, will create nearly 50,000 jobs statewide—9,000 new high-paying Micron jobs with an average annual salary of more than $100,000 and more than 40,000 community jobs—and create thousands and thousands of prevailing wage construction jobs. When complete, the complex will include the nation&#8217;s largest clean room space at approximately 2.4 million square feet, the size of nearly 40 football fields.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said, “Micron&#8217;s $100-billion investment in New York marks the start of something transformative in scale and possibility for our state&#8217;s economic future. I promised that we would jumpstart the economy by being the most business-friendly and worker-friendly state in the nation, and thanks to our State Green CHIPS legislation, the federal CHIPS and Science Act, and extraordinary partnerships with business, labor, and local and federal leaders, this project will do exactly that. Together, we are leveraging this investment—the largest private-sector investment in state history—to secure our economic future, solidify New York&#8217;s standing as a global manufacturing hub, and usher the state into another Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<div id="attachment_42518" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42518" class="wp-image-42518" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FeauUiuXoAEGmEU.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="211" /><p id="caption-attachment-42518" class="wp-caption-text">From left, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, greets President Biden.</p></div>
<p>Two days later, President Biden visited IBM’s Poughkeepsie operations to tout the CHIPS and Science Act’s impact on IBM’s decision to invest $20 billion across the Hudson Valley region over the next 10 years. IBM’s investment will be centered on advancing its R&amp;D and manufacturing of semiconductors, mainframe technology, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</p>
<p>Also in New York State, Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries recently announced a new partnership that includes $4.2 billion in funding to manufacture chips in an expansion of GlobalFoundries’ upstate New York facility.</p>
<p>President Biden, during his speech noted that although outside New York State, Intel announced last month that it was spending $20 billion to build two semiconductor plants in the state of Ohio.</p>
<p>He told the crowd at the IBM facility that “the Hudson Valley could become the epicenter of the future of quantum computing, the most advanced and fastest computing ever, ever seen in the world.”</p>
<p>President Biden later added, “Where is it written that we can’t lead manufacturing in the world? I don’t know where that’s written. And that’s one of the things the CHIPS Act is going to change. A law that’s going to build the future and a proud, proud legacy not only for IBM, but for the country—a legacy of innovation and manufacturing that exists in this region of New York.”</p>
<p>IBM stated that the goal of its investments, which it said will be strengthened by close collaboration with New York State, is “to expand the vibrant technology ecosystem in New York to unlock new discoveries and opportunities in semiconductors, computers, hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence and quantum computers.” It did not supply further specifics on its planned investments.</p>
<p>The company and its businesses support more than 7,500 jobs across the Hudson Valley. This region has been a hub of innovation and manufacturing for decades—from Westchester County to Poughkeepsie to Albany.</p>
<p>“IBM is deeply honored to host President Biden at our Poughkeepsie site today and we look forward to highlighting our commitments to the innovations that advance America&#8217;s economy,” Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, said. “As we tackle large-scale technological challenges in climate, energy, transportation and more, we must continue to invest in innovation and discovery &#8211; because advanced technologies are key to solving these problems and driving economic prosperity, including better jobs, for millions of Americans.”</p>
<p>A host of other state and federal representatives were on hand for the IBM announcement, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who said, “Millions of good-paying jobs in American manufacturing are coming back to our communities, and we can see that investment happening right here in the Hudson Valley. Thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, which I was proud to help pass this year, we are creating an economy that works for all Americans today and ensures our competitiveness for generations to come.”</p>
<p>The CHIPS and Science Act will invest:</p>
<p>• $54.2 billion for chip manufacturing and public wireless supply chain innovation, including:</p>
<p>• $39 billion in financial assistance for domestic semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, packaging and more.</p>
<p>• $11 billion for research and development through the National Semiconductor Technology Center, the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, and the Manufacturing USA Semiconductor Institute.</p>
<p>• $200 million to develop a domestic semiconductor workforce in partnership with the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>• $81 billion for the National Science Foundation to reinvest in American education and research, including: $20 billion for a new Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships to develop critical technologies such as AI, quantum computing, and materials sciences; $13 billion to support growing the STEM workforce and $11 billion for the Department of Commerce to establish regional innovation hubs.</p>
<div id="attachment_42516" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42516" class="wp-image-42516" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/310592885_652058349620687_2950201622328392200_n.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-42516" class="wp-caption-text">President Biden told the crowd at the IBM facility that “the Hudson Valley could become the epicenter of the future of quantum computing.”</p></div>
<p>The new law also provides a 25% investment tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing. The credit covers both manufacturing equipment and the construction of facilities.</p>
<p>Economic development agencies throughout the state will be looking to take advantage of the funding from the CHIPS and Science Act.</p>
<p>For example, the Orange County Partnership is hoping that its Site Inventory Program, which was launched earlier this year, will uncover some suitable shovel-ready sites for projects that could benefit from CHIPS and Science Act funding.</p>
<p>“Projects such as Micron highlight the importance of getting sites shovel ready. Shovel ready sites are no longer a luxury, they’re a necessity,” said Conor Eckert, Senior Development Officer and Vice President of Business Attraction for the Goshen-based Orange County Partnership. “In order to compete for mega-projects in Orange County, we need site readiness, predictability, and speed. As we work to attract the advanced manufacturing and life science sectors, developing new shovel ready sites will be at the center of our economic development efforts at the Orange County Partnership.”</p>
<p>The organization’s SIP’s goal is to meet with municipal governments across Orange County to determine all the available properties that could be developed in their respective jurisdictions, their infrastructure needs, regulatory approval requirements and what industries would be best suited for those parcels. The Site Inventory Program seeks to take advantage of some of Orange County’s key growth industries—food &amp; beverage processing, advanced manufacturing, clean energy and life sciences—that the Partnership believes will be investing and creating jobs in the county over the next two decades.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Eckert and Kaitlynn Lancellotti, Director of Business Retention and Expansion for the Orange County Partnership, have met with a host of localities and have further sessions planned in order to create a comprehensive list of properties that could be made available to growth companies such as Micron or IBM or Intel that are investing billions because of the CHIPS and Science Act.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Home sales continued to decline in the third quarter of this year as the New York City and Hudson Valley markets grapple with stubborn low inventory levels, high inflation, rising interest rates and home prices.</p>
<p>Overall home sales in the region fell in the fourth quarter of 2021 and now in the first three quarters of 2022. While some economists are predicting a likely recession in 2023 and Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors, said recently that the national housing industry is already in recession, brokers affiliated with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors indicate that the current market in the region is not anywhere near recessionary levels. They admit that home sales are down, but stress that transaction levels are lower as compared to the frenzied COVID-19 markets of 2020 and 2021. The chief culprits for the decline are low inventory and rising interest rates that are now approaching 7% and high inflation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-42593" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HGAR-Market-Area-Home-Sales-3Q-2022.png" alt="" width="383" height="351" />According to the 2022 Third Quarter Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx counties released by OneKey MLS earlier this month, all counties in the HGAR market suffered lower sales in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to a year earlier, with the exception of Sullivan County, which enjoyed a 2.9% increase in overall residential sales.</p>
<p>Overall home sales in the Bronx fell 2.5% in the third quarter of this year, followed by Rockland County’s 9.8% decline. Home sales in Putnam were 12.6% lower, Westchester saw a 13.5% drop and finally Orange County’s overall transactions slipped by 15.8%,</p>
<p>According to the OneKey MLS report, not all was bad news in the Bronx. Single-family home sales surged 9.2% in the borough over the third quarter of 2021. The median sales price of $630,000 was 6.8% ahead of last year. However, condo sales lagged from the previous third quarter.</p>
<p>Another area that bucked the downward trend was Sullivan County, which posted single-family sales of 300 transactions. The third quarter 2022 total was just slightly higher than the 298 total of the previous year and the median sales price was up more than 10% when compared to the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>In Westchester County, third quarter single-family home sales of 2,006 declined 15.6% compared to the third quarter of 2021. However, when compared to the third quarter of 2019, single-family home sales in Westchester were up 3.4%. Condo sales in Westchester for the third quarter of 2022 decreased by 24.5% and co-op sales were on par with the previous third quarter. The single-family median sale price of $872,000 posted a 2% increase over last year, the condo median sale price of $460,000 was slightly down, and the co-op median sale price of $204,500 was 2.3% higher than the previous year.</p>
<p>In Putnam County, the 326 single-family home sales were down 10.7% compared to the third quarter of 2021, but when compared to 2019, the number of sales were almost identical. The median sales price of $505,000 was 8.6% higher than the third quarter of 2021. Rockland County likewise experienced a drop in transactions, with single-family home sales down 9.2% and condo sales down 15.8%. However, when continuing the comparison to the third quarter of 2019, the 2022 third quarter numbers were slightly ahead. The single-family median sales price of $660,000 for the third quarter of 2022 in Rockland County was 14.2% higher than 2021.</p>
<p>In Orange County the third quarter single-family home sales total of 1,019 was down 14% over the 2021 third quarter, and the condo sales number of 138 was off an even steeper 23.3%. The single-family home median sales price was up 9.1% at $420,000 and the median condo sales price of $270,950 for the third quarter reflected a 13.4% increase over the 2021 third quarter. <strong>Editor’s Note:<a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2022-3rd-Quarter-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> For the full OneKey MLS report and sales statistics</a></strong></p>
<p>Leah Caro, president and principal broker of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville, said there is a “crisis of availability and affordability” in the markets at the moment. The number of homes for sale continue to be low, she noted, which keeps the scales titled towards sellers rather than buyers.</p>
<p>She also said that while demand is still high, the fierce competition that existed for the past year-and-a-half has eased somewhat. “Instead of five or six or even 20 offers on a house, now we’ll see two,” Caro said. She also advised that sellers should price their homes fairly because consumers are now focused keenly on pricing due to higher interest rates and higher cost of living.</p>
<p>“Some folks who got squeezed out of the overheated market of last year are still looking for homes and some folks who were looking previously have taken a step back to get their financial house in order,” Caro said. “I would not call it a recession in the housing market by any stretch. But, we do really have a problem with inventory right now and I think that is the biggest thing dampening the number of sales.”</p>
<p>Barry Kramer, principal broker/owner of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Choice Realty of Scarsdale, told Real Estate In-Depth that despite higher rates, “we are still seeing robust activity of buyers and sellers.”</p>
<p>Kramer, who specializes in cooperative sales in the Hartsdale-Scarsdale area, added that inventory is still tight. “I believe the impact of the interest rates going up is that anyone that was on the fence is more actively pursuing purchasing a home,” Kramer said.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer and managing partner at Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, said that while NAR Chief Economist Yun may be correct that the overall national housing market may be in recession, the market in the New York metro region certainly is not.</p>
<p>While for-sale inventory continues to be low, demand continues to be high as are sales when compared to previous historic strong markets.</p>
<p>He said that while sales are down from the pandemic-induced frenzied sales markets of 2021 and 2020, sales activity now mirrors the markets in 2018 and 2019, which were considered strong sales markets at the time.</p>
<p>“Every home seller in Westchester and the Hudson Valley who sells their home in 2023 will absolutely sell it for more than they paid for,” Rand said. “And that is something we haven’t been able to say since 2007.”</p>
<p>He said the bottom line for the housing market going forward in 2023 is that sales will likely continue to decline off of 2021and 2022 transaction numbers. The decline will be fueled by low inventory, higher interest rates, which tends to blunt consumer demand, and high prices, “which sometimes scares some buyers off,” he noted.</p>
<p>While stressing that he believes the New York City-Hudson Valley markets will not enter a recessionary period in 2023, Rand predicted, “I am expecting a market that has 2015-2016 level sales, but prices that are 30% higher than they were back then.”</p>
<p>He concluded by saying that in 2023 he expects home sale price escalation to level off with some areas perhaps seeing a small decline from current record high prices.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors has notified the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors that it will bestow the PLATINUM Global Achievement Program Award for 2022 to HGAR for its global services initiatives undertaken by its Global Business Council at a national conference in Orlando in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The PLATINUM Global Achievement Program award is presented to Realtor associations that “provide the highest level of global services to its members by consistently providing them with the tools they need to handle international real estate and connect with the global community in the area.”</p>
<p>Tony D’Anzica, HGAR President Elect and 2022 Global Business Council Co-Chair, announced HGAR’s award selection today. He said HGAR’s Global Business Council has been one of the most active and innovative in the United States. “We topped off our year with a stunningly successful Global Real Estate Summit (held in New York City on Oct. 20). HGAR, led by our Global Business Council, brought together 11 Realtor associations in three states and two countries to create one of the largest collaborative efforts ever spearheaded by a local Realtor association,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, HGAR’s Global Business Council organized its first Trade Mission to Portugal in June, which included attendees from HGAR and Realtors from other countries and states. Hosted by partner, Portugal International Realty (PIR), participants attended classes, toured new developments, met with accountants, attorneys and local Realtors. The HGAR contingent was also hosted by the Porto City Council at City Hall, attended a dinner hosted by the Mayor of Porto, and formed a new relationship with APEMIP, Portugal&#8217;s national professional real estate association. At NAR&#8217;s NXT convention in November, HGAR will reunite with a 15 member Portuguese delegation from PIR and APEMIP where HGAR will continue to explore ways to develop key partnerships.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-42661 size-medium" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Global-Platinum-250x250.png?_t=1668448023" alt="" width="250" height="250" />“As co-chair of our Global Business Council, along with co-chair Emi Cacace, we are proud that we have been able to provide our HGAR members with what is now a nationally recognized model for providing education, events, and opportunities to raise our global awareness, increase our level of professionalism, and foster opportunities to expand our real estate business networks both locally and globally,” D’Anzica said. “As your 2023 President-elect, I am committed to making sure that HGAR will not only continue to provide our members with the best possible resources to grow professionally, but will continue to lead our entire metropolitan region in developing innovative and valuable programming.”</p>
<p>D&#8217;Anzica also thanked HGAR staff, including Director of Marketing Cathleen Stack, for assisting the council in expanding its service offerings.</p>
<p>Other key efforts undertaken in 2022 by the HGAR Global Business Council include:</p>
<p>• Collaborated with FIABCI International to organize an Investor Forum and Cocktail Reception and participate in the three-day FIABCI International Trade Mission in New York City. (15 Members of the HGAR Global Business Council participated.)</p>
<p>• Continued with its innovative and unique Global Business Chat series (featuring Switzerland, Ecuador and Canada to date).</p>
<p>• Signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ukrainian Realtors Association.</p>
<p>• Hosted one of Dubai&#8217;s leading developers, Nahkeel, at the HGAR offices in White Plains.</p>
<p>• Hosted an annual International Night together with HGAR’s YPN Group.</p>
<p>• Hosted a “Live from Dubai Expo” webcast.</p>
<p>• Represented HGAR at the MIPIM conference in Cannes, France, where HGAR President, Anthony Domathoti participated on a panel and was featured in its magazine.</p>
<p>• Offered HGAR Members CIPS Classes in conjunction with NYSAR. HGAR had many Global Business Council and other HGAR Members participate in these classes including the new class on Africa offered recently. There is still one class remaining, offered on Nov. 16 &amp; 17th—The Americas and International Real Estate.</p>
<p>• Hosted a CIPS networking event in the Bronx and participated in many others throughout our metropolitan region.</p>
<p>• Conducted the Global Business Council’s first International Residential Real Estate Business Survey in conjunction with NAR.</p>
<p>The award will be presented to HGAR during the NAR NXT Conference in Orlando, FL, which will be held from Nov. 11-13.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>PORT CHESTER—It appears that plans to redevelop the long-shuttered United Hospital property off Route 1 in Port Chester can finally proceed to construction in 2023 after nearly two decades of false starts and community opposition that prevented shovels turning dirt on the venture.</p>
<p>Rose Associates and BedRock Real Estate Partners announced they recently secured final site plan approval from the Village of Port Chester to develop a 15.45-acre site that has been unused for 17 years. The property at 406 Boston Post Road, once home to United Hospital, will be completely redeveloped into a mixed-use community comprised of a half-acre of open green space surrounded by multi-family housing, retail and restaurant spaces, a boutique hotel and assisted living senior housing.</p>
<p>“Port Chester is one of metropolitan New York’s most exciting villages and we are thrilled to start work at this property that’s been vacant and unused for far too long,” said Amy Rose, president and CEO of Rose Associates. “In addition to hundreds of apartments, we’ll be creating attractive amenities that will be accessed through a much-improved streetscape along Boston Post Road.”</p>
<p>Located on Route 1 at the intersection of I-95 and I-287, the property is within walking distance to the Metro North commuter rail station in Port Chester. There are a number of vacant buildings at the site, which Rose and BedRock will raze in a first step toward creating the new, mixed-use community.</p>
<p>Plans call for 775 multifamily rental apartments, 90 independent living apartments and 110 assisted- and memory-care units, a 120-key boutique hotel and more than 18,000 square feet of retail space. Rose Associates has not released any estimated development cost for the project.</p>
<p>“It is incredibly exciting to reach this milestone and we are thankful to the village and their consultants for taking the time to work with us, examine our plans and provide their approval,” said Michael Adamo, managing director of acquisitions at Rose Associates, which is currently developing two other multifamily properties in Westchester County. “We’re excited to move forward with our plans and to create something that’s beneficial to Port Chester and the region.”</p>
<p>The developers received final site plan approval from the Village of Port Chester at the Board of Trustee’s Oct. 17, 2022 meeting. Building abatement and demolition is scheduled to begin in early 2023. United Hospital shut its doors for good in 2005.</p>
<p>The property was acquired by Starwood Capital Group in 2006, which proposed a $450-million redevelopment of the property. Starwood Capital had secured zoning approval for its redevelopment project in Port Chester, but never proceeded with construction. The firm sold the site to partners Rose Associates and BedRock Real Estate Partners of New York City on June 28, 2019. No financial details of the transaction were disclosed.</p>
<p>The original estimated $450-million Starwood Capital Group plan called for 90,000 square-feet of street-level shops and restaurants, an approximately 135-room hotel, 217,000 square-feet of office space, 500 residential units designed for young professionals, 230 units of age-restricted senior residential, on-site parking and nearly an acre of publicly accessible open space.</p>
<p>In the past year, Rose Associates has seen its number of units under management increase to more than 21,000. The company is no stranger to Westchester County, currently building the $203-million 440 Hamilton Ave. mixed-use project in White Plains, and the $177-million multifamily residential project at 57 Alexander St. in Yonkers and 8 Court Square in Long Island City.</p>
<p>In addition, Rose recently reported that it is assisting Global Holdings with the development of One West 60th St. and redeveloping 301 East 94th Street with Marmara Group in New York City.</p>
<p>Founded in 1925, Rose Associates is a New York City-based developer, owner and operator of premium residential properties. The firm oversees more than 26,000 units across New York, with approximately $2 billion in projects under development. Rose recently opened the historic skyscraper 70 Pine St., which the firm is transforming into a luxury rental property with 644 residential units, 132 extend-stay apartments and a destination restaurant/lounge occupying the top four floors.</p>
<p>BedRock Real Estate Partners LLC is a privately held investment manager specializing in the development and acquisition of rental apartments and mixed-use projects in urban locations from Boston to Washington, DC with a particular focus in New York City. The firm, which began operations in 2013, has invested in 18 projects, comprising more than 1.75 million square feet of apartment and retail space, with assets under management of more than $1.3 billion.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The long-promised redevelopment plan for The Galleria at White Plains, which was the focal point of the urban renewal of the downtown district in the late 1970s and early 1980s, is taking shape.</p>
<p>While details are still sketchy at best, the owner of the 870,000-square-foot, four-level retail property—Pacific Retail Capital Partners and Aareal Bank—announced on Nov. 3 it was bringing on new joint venture partners—SL Green Realty Corp. of New York City and the Cappelli Organization of White Plains to “explore mixed uses” and “rebalance the mix of uses” for the property that has fallen on hard times as its two chief anchors—Macy’s and Sears—have both shuttered their stores there. Pacific Retail Capital Partners is headquartered in El Segundo, CA and Aareal Bank is based in Wiesbaden, Germany.</p>
<p>Both Macy’s and Sears shut their anchor stores at the Galleria at White Plains in the first quarter of 2021. Pacific Retail Capital officials said they plan to close a portion of the mall early next year in connection with its redevelopment plans that many observers believe will be tilted heavily towards residential use.</p>
<div id="attachment_42688" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42688" class="wp-image-42688" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PacificRetail_Headshot_Steve_Plenge.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-42688" class="wp-caption-text">Steve Plenge, Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Retail Capital Partners</p></div>
<p>“This is one of the most exciting mixed-use development sites in the New York Metro area,” said Steve Plenge, Chief Executive Officer of PRCP. “We have worked over the past few years to acquire the Macy’s fee interest at the site, along with the leasehold interest of the former Sears. Working with our new partners, we will reimagine the site as a vibrant mixed-use project that will be centered on residential development and amenity-based retail.”</p>
<p>No financial terms of the joint venture partnership were released. Macy’s sold its White Plains store to Pacific Retail Capital in 2019 for $27 million, according to the Journal News.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Pacific Retail Capital stated that with its new partners it “is dedicated to creating a unique and strategic vision through master planning efforts and cutting-edge design for the Galleria at White Plains to transform it for the next generation.”</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased for the opportunity to join with SL Green, Aareal Bank Group and Pacific Retail Capital Partners in the redevelopment of The Galleria site,” said Louis R. Cappelli, Chief Executive Officer of The Cappelli Organization. “The reimagining of this property is integral to the dramatic transformation of Downtown White Plains that is well underway. We are fortunate to be able to play a role in recreating the property with mixed uses which will link the city’s transit center with the Mamaroneck Avenue corridor.”</p>
<p>He added that the redevelopment of the Galleria comes as Cappelli entity LRC Construction works on Hamilton Green—the estimated $600-million redevelopment of the former White Plains Mall. RXR Realty is leading a partnership in that massive project that calls for the construction of 860 apartment units in four high-rise buildings, 84,500 square feet of specialty retail and restaurant space, including a Food and Craft Hall, 27,000 square feet of office space, and an approximately 956-space parking garage and open space. The Hamilton Green project will be built in phases.</p>
<p>“Together, the two major projects will effectively complete the transformation of the downtown that began as an Urban Renewal project more than 50 years ago,” Cappelli stated.</p>
<p>Cappelli has a long history in Downtown White Plains, redeveloping the former Macy’s store on Mamaroneck Avenue into City Center, as well as developing multiple high-rise towers including the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Residences, Trump Tower at City Center and the Lofts at City Center in White Plains.</p>

Cappelli, Chief Executive Officer of The Cappelli Organization</p></div>
<p>“The Galleria at White Plains is an important property in Westchester County and the region. With our experienced real estate partners, the new masterplan and design will build upon the remarkable renaissance under way in Downtown White Plains,” said Plenge. “The existing Galleria White Plains has been a community staple for many years. We anticipate closing a portion of the mall in early 2023 to evolve the asset and rebalance the mix of uses through a transformative development to meet the needs of the next generation,” Plenge added.</p>
<p>Pacific Retail Capital Partners of El Segundo, CA acquired the Galleria at White Plains from Simon Property Group in September 2016. No purchase price was reported. Pacific Retail announced the purchase as one of three regional malls totaling 2.8 million square feet it added to its portfolio at the time.</p>
<p>At deadline, further information on the specifics of the proposal, when plans will be submitted for review to the City of White Plains, as well as occupancy rates and other property information were not available.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For years, people have been able to eavesdrop on others. This had been done by wiretapping phones, electronic listening devices and cameras. Sometimes these devices are obvious; other times, they’re hidden. Today, home security systems and “nanny cams” are everywhere. Recently, NYSAR came out with new disclosure forms and recommended disclosure language relating to the use of audio devices in a home for listening into people’s conversations during an open house, a showing, or any other real estate-related activity.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to understand the laws surrounding the use of these devices and how to handle their presence when listing or showing a property. Second, because of the pervasiveness of these devices, NYSAR created disclosure forms which should be presented to the homeowner/landlord and any prospective buyer/tenant relating to the use of these devices. These forms should be signed by the necessary parties in order to protect them and the real estate agent. Finally, HGAR has adopted these forms and they are available in our document library and HGAR has updated its Exclusive Right to Sell and Exclusive Right to Rent agreements to add necessary language related to these important disclosures. So today, let’s go over these new developments.</p>
<p><strong>The Law</strong></p>
<p>Eavesdropping under Penal Law §250.00(2) states: “Mechanical overhearing of a conversation means the intentional overhearing or recording of a conversation or discussion, without the consent of at least one party thereto, by a person not present thereat, by means of any instrument, device or equipment.” Additionally, Penal Law §250.05, sets forth the crime of “eavesdropping” where “a person is guilty of eavesdropping when he unlawfully engages in wiretapping, mechanical overhearing of a conversation, or intercepting or accessing of an electronic communication.”</p>
<p>The simple meaning of these provisions, read together, means that you cannot record a conversation unless one party to the conversation is aware and permits it. If the party listening is not part of the conversation and no one knows they are being recorded, it’s illegal. It is legal if one person to the conversation is aware and consents to the records (i.e.. all parties do not need to consent; only one). As a result, it is a crime for a homeowner to use audio recordings during showings unless the seller is showing the house and is part of the conversation or the listing agent is aware of the audio device, is present, and participating in the conversation (he/she can’t just be nearby and not part of the conversation).</p>
<p>A real estate licensee who is aware of a homeowner/landlord’s intent to use audio recordings must warn them not to do so unless they obtain the proper consent; otherwise, the homeowner/landlord may be found guilty of a Class E Felony, and the real estate agent may be complicit in that crime. Further, it would be a violation of licensing law if the real estate agent did not disclose the fact that the homeowner/landlord is recording conversations; therefore, the real estate agent must advise all cooperating brokers and consumers if a homeowner/landlord is using audio devices and receive their written consent to be recorded.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the use of video recording devices (with no audio) is permitted, so long as the recording is being done where there is no expectation of privacy (i.e., bathroom, bedroom, etc.) and they are not required to be disclosed for security purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Seller/Landlord Audio Recording Device and Disclosure Form</strong></p>
<p>NYSAR had created, and HGAR has adopted, two new forms and strongly recommends that all Realtors use them. The first is the Seller/Landlord Audio Recording Device and Disclosure Form. It can be found at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/SFL-NYSAR-Audio-Recording-Device-Disclosure-Form-Final-11-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/SFL-NYSAR-Audio-Recording-Device-Disclosure-Form-Final-11-22.pdf</a>.<br />
This form advises the homeowner/landlord/property manager that it is in violation of New York State Penal Law to mechanically overhear, record, stream or otherwise document conversations if they are not a party. This applies to open houses, showings, etc. The form goes on to state that if such devices are present, visitors will be notified of their presence. If such devices are present and operating, the visitors must execute the consent portion of the form.</p>
<p><strong>Buyer/Tenant Audio Recording Device Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>The second form is the Buyer/Tenant Audio Recording Device Disclosure form. It can be found at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/SFL-NYSAR-Buyer-tenant-audio-recording-device-disclosure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/SFL-NYSAR-Buyer-tenant-audio-recording-device-disclosure.pdf</a></p>
<p>This disclosure advises both buyers and tenants that the homeowner/landlord may have an audio device to record, stream or otherwise document conversations at the subject property during open houses, showings, etc. It goes on to state that absent a disclosure from a homeowner/landlord that there are no devices present, buyers/tenants should presume that every property being shown may have a device present and that their conversation will be heard. Therefore, they should not discuss matters that they do not wish to share with the homeowner/landlord. This form is a section that must be filled out by the buyer/tenant acknowledging that they have received and read this disclosure notice and that the homeowner/landlord may be accessing audio of any conversation conducted at the property.</p>
<p><strong>Modification to the Exclusive Right to Sell And Exclusive Right to Rent Agreements</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with NYSAR’s recommendations, HGAR has updated its OneKey MLS Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement: <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/OneKey-Exclusive-Right-to-Sell-Listing-Agreement-11.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/OneKey-Exclusive-Right-to-Sell-Listing-Agreement-11.22.pdf</a> and its Exclusive Right to Rent Agreement: Exclusive Right to Rent link: <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/OneKey-Exlusive-Right-to-Rent-Listing-Agreement-11.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/11/OneKey-Exlusive-Right-to-Rent-Listing-Agreement-11.22.pdf</a><br />
to include language relating to the use of audio devices. This new language notes that it is in violation to record, stream or otherwise document the conversation of an individual during real estate-related activity at a property if you are not a party to that conversation. It adds that if such a device is present and will be operating, and any potential buyer/tenant is viewing the property, the homeowner/landlord understands that the listing agent must disclose the presence of such a device.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The use of audio recording devices is now commonplace. However, this does not mean that they can be used with impunity, even in our own homes. The unauthorized listening in on a private conversation, without permission, is a felony. Therefore, all Realtors should adopt the new disclosure forms and the updated Exclusive Right to Sell and Exclusive Right to Rent Agreements (and throw out the old ones) to ensure that the homeowners/landlords are compliant with state laws, and that buyers/tenants are aware of these laws and notified of the conditions at a prospective property. Failure to do so, may result in criminal charges, loss of licensure, and at a minimum, the inadvertent sharing of confidential information that was not intended to be shared.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Tormey has been an Affiliate Member for just a few years, but in that time, he has provided many informative programs to HGAR members and has supported the Association through various sponsorships of programs and events.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When Brian Tormey, President of TitleVest Agency in Manhattan, attended HGAR’s Members Appreciation Day in October, he had no idea it would end with him being named the Association’s Affiliate Member of the Year. “I was completely surprised, and I am truly honored,” he said. “I really never expected this.”</p>
<p>Tormey has been an Affiliate Member for just a few years, but in that time, he has provided many informative programs to HGAR members and has supported the Association through various sponsorships of programs and events.</p>
<p>He became very well-known to members during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, when all of the association’s events were suddenly forced to switch from live to virtual. Tormey was one of the first to step to the plate and offer interesting and compelling virtual content that helped fill the void created by the lack of in-person events.</p>
<p>It was actually before OneKey MLS launched that Tormey was introduced to HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty. “We were discussing an MLS solution for New York City, and then at the beginning of the pandemic, we developed a program to help fill the gap in live events,” he said. That was the beginning of TitleVest’s “Be Your Best” series, geared toward real estate professionals in the New York City metro area and the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, TitleVest has offered dozens of virtual seminars dealing with everything from selling during a pandemic to analyzing market stats to forecasting next year’s interest rates. Once live events began to resume, Tormey also jumped on the bandwagon with events in Manhattan, helping tremendously with HGAR’s growth in New York City.</p>
<p>How he landed in the title insurance business is an interesting twist of events. “I started out as a young kid washing trucks outside of a timber company in Oregon,” Tormey recalled. “People there liked how detail-oriented I was and thought I might be good working inside the office.”</p>
<p>At age 14, he began digitizing property holdings and helping to review change of title land easements. He worked after school, on weekends and during the summer, earning a reputation as “young whippersnapper.” “I learned a lot, but I didn’t have any thought about doing this as a career,” he admitted.</p>
<p>After graduating from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, Tormey had all intentions of going to law school. After working at a law firm as a paralegal, he decided to take the opportunity to join a small title company in 2003, and that was the beginning of a successful career in the industry.</p>
<p>“The thing I love about title insurance is that I get to work with the same customers on a routine basis,” he explained. “I deal with Realtors, loan officers, attorneys and other professionals and support them in their transactions.”</p>
<p>Tormey eventually bought into that small firm, which is now TitleVest. In 2015, the firm became part of First American Title. TitleVest, however, maintains its own identity and brand but has the added support of a corporation that has been in business for 133 years.</p>
<p>The company is involved with both residential and commercial real estate and is licensed in 44 states. The Manhattan office has also handled transactions across the country including shopping malls, hotels and hospitals. “People should think about title insurance as the partner with you to ensure there are no challenges after the closing as it relates to ownership,” explained Tormey.</p>
<p>Titlevest has been named one of the Top 5,000 Fastest Growing Companies by Inc. Magazine, and also won “Best Title Agency” in the New York Law Journal’s reader rankings every year since 2013. In addition, the firm has been honored as the ‘Best Title Company” by the National Law Journal.</p>
<p>Tormey himself is often quoted in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and was the second person in New York to receive the prestigious “National Title Professional” designation by the American Land Title Association.</p>
<p>Tormey lives in Garrison with his wife Sarah and their children—Jameson, 12 and Annabelle, 10. The family often spends time hiking together and Tormey is a big fan of rock climbing and mountain biking. He has also coached soccer and become involved with the Boy Scouts. An unexpected pastime for the busy company president, Tormey relaxes by taking glass blowing classes.</p>
<p>He and his family also return to his native Oregon to visit family and friends, and his personal passion is his involvement in a book by local author Seth Godin called “The Carbon Almanac.”</p>
<p>“It’s a non-partisan look at the facts about climate change and what individuals can do about it,” he said. The book is actually a collaboration among hundreds of writers, researchers, thinkers and illustrators. “It’s stepping away from the political focus and pulling people from all over the world together to deal with this important subject.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are many critical issues real estate licensees and real estate attorneys should be aware of when it comes to representing the estate of a deceased individual. It is important for these professionals to have a basic knowledge of these issues before being formally engaged by an estate, the nominated representative of an estate, or the trustee of a decedent’s trust, to sell real property or a cooperative apartment.</p>
<p>Often individuals who are a named (nominated) executor in the Last Will and Testament, or who is the trustee in a decedent’s Trust, will contact a real estate agent before contacting an attorney in order to sell the property of a decedent because they believe they are automatically authorized to sell the property on behalf of the Estate or Trust. The individual will provide a copy of the decedent’s Will or Trust to an agent and the agent may believe that the agent is authorized to enter into a listing agreement with that person simply because that person is the named executor in the Will or the named Trustee.</p>
<p><strong>Referral to an Experienced Estate Attorney is Critical</strong></p>
<p>There is much more that needs to be done before a real estate broker may enter into a listing agreement and list the property for sale. It is critical that the agent and/or real estate attorney refer the potential client to an attorney experienced in Estate administration. An experienced Estate attorney will be able to determine whether a probate proceeding (where there is a Will) or administration proceeding (where there is no Will) needs to be commenced with the Surrogate’s Court. There are also instances where a formal court proceeding may not be necessary (which will be discussed later in this article) therefore, it is important for an Estate attorney to be consulted as soon as possible. If it is determined that a formal probate or administration proceeding may not be needed, this could save several months in the process.</p>
<p>If a formal probate or administration proceeding is required, it can take 60-90 days, and longer, to collect and prepare the necessary paperwork to be filed with the Surrogate’s Court in order to have an Executor or Administrator appointed. In most instances, until an Executor or Administrator is officially appointed by the Surrogate’s Court a cooperative apartment or real property may not be listed for sale.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Actually Authorized to Sell a Property When a Person Dies?</strong></p>
<p>In New York, generally the law provides that upon the death of an individual, real property automatically passes to the devisees (i.e., those individuals specifically named in the Will) or distributees (i.e., those individuals who are heirs at law and where there is no Will) of the decedent. When a person passes away without a Will that person is said to have passed “intestate,” and where a person passes away with a Will that person is said to have passed “testate.” It is very important to determine whether or not there is a Will, or if a Trust exists, because this will dictate what process will need to be followed, what proceeding (if any) will need to be filed, who the authorized representatives are, and how quickly a sale could be contemplated.</p>
<p><strong>Who Inherits When a Person Dies Intestate?</strong></p>
<p>When a person dies intestate, that person&#8217;s property (both personal and real property) is distributed according to Section 4-1.1 of the Estate, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3WTqK7b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3WTqK7b</a>). Generally, if an individual passes away with a spouse and no children, the spouse will inherit all of the decedent’s real and personal property owned in the decedent’s name at the time of death (and not passing by a beneficiary designation or by operation of law). If the decedent had children but no spouse, then the children would inherit the decedent’s real and personal property.</p>
<p>If the decedent passes away intestate with a spouse and children, then the spouse would inherit the first $50,000 and 50% of the decedent’s remaining Estate with the child(ren) inheriting the remaining 50%. If a child dies before the decedent and that child had children, then the decedent’s grandchildren would inherit their deceased parent’s share, proportionately. If the decedent had no spouse or children at the time of death, then the decedent’s parents would inherit. Finally, if the decedent passed away with no spouse, children (or grandchildren), or parents, then the siblings of the decedent would inherit decedent’s Estate. The EPTL provides further elaboration on who inherits beyond the classes of individuals detailed above.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is the Authorized Representative When a Person Dies Intestate?</strong></p>
<p>If there is no Will, the “closest distributee” or “heir at law” may file an administration proceeding and apply for formal Letters of Administration, which would provide the Administrator with the legal authorization to represent the decedent’s Estate. According to the EPTL, the decedent&#8217;s spouse has priority over the decedent&#8217;s children to file the proceeding. However, if there is no spouse, then the decedent&#8217;s children would have equal rights to each other and would have to consent to have one individual, or more, appointed as the official Administrator(s) of the Estate.</p>
<p>If a spouse, child, or relative, as the case may be, with the priority right or equal right does not want to administer the Estate, then those individuals may sign a renunciation and waiver, which is filed with the Surrogate’s Court. This does not mean that they are giving up their share of the decedent&#8217;s Estate, they are simply consenting to the appointment of other individual(s) as Administrator(s) of the Estate (including signing listing agreements, contracts for the sale of real property and/or cooperative apartments, court documents, collecting assets, closing accounts, selling stocks, paying Estate expenses, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Who Becomes the Legal Owner of Real Property </strong><strong>Or Cooperative Apartments Upon a Decedent’s Death?</strong></p>
<p>One important thing to note is that even where an Administrator may be required to administer the Estate of a decedent, if there is real property involved, the law generally provides that the distributees (i.e., the heirs at law) become the owners, as tenants in common, of real property upon the death of an individual owner and title vests immediately in the distributees [see <em>In re Fry’s Estate</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3UQf8jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3UQf8jp</a>]. Therefore, generally, the distributees would be authorized to sell and transfer real property without having to file a formal administration proceeding. However, notwithstanding the above, it is always strongly recommended that the Estate attorney representing the Estate discuss whether or not an administration proceeding is required. If it is determined that an administration proceeding is not required, then all of the legal distributees (heirs) would be authorized and required to sign a listing agreement, and real property would be able to be sold fairly quickly. All of the distributees would be required to attend the closing and execute the deed transferring the real property to the purchasers.</p>
<p>However, with respect to the sale of a cooperative apartment, the above would not be true. Ownership in a cooperative apartment is represented by shares (evidenced by stock certificates) in a cooperative corporation and a lease (tenancy) interest in a proprietary lease. Under the law shares are considered personal property and, therefore, the automatic vesting component that exists in connection with real property, does not apply to shares in a cooperative corporation. In this instance, the legal distributee would be required to file an administration proceeding and must be formally appointed as Administrator before any listing agreement is entered into and prior to any sale or transfer of the apartment. Again, this means that it could take several months before the sale process actually begins.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the Authorized Representative When a Person Dies Testate (With a Will) and There is No Specific Bequest of Real Property?</strong></p>
<p>When a person passes away with a Will (i.e., testate), then the specific provisions of the Will of the decedent will apply and must be reviewed before any listing agreement is entered into or sale of real property is contemplated. If there is no specific bequest of real property to specifically named individuals contained in the Will, and the Will provides, generally, that the entire Estate (after payment of all expenses, liabilities, debts, etc.) is to be shared amongst the named devisees (this is known as the Residuary Estate), then the nominated executor will be required to commence a probate (rather than an administration) proceeding in order to administer the decedent’s Estate. It is recommended that the nominated Executor hire an Estate attorney so that a probate petition can be filed with the Surrogate’s Court in the county where the decedent’s primary residence was located as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Once the probate petition is approved and Letters Testamentary are issued by the Surrogate’s Court, the nominated Executor is officially appointed Executor of the Estate and the Estate administration process can formally begin. It is only at this point that an Executor would be authorized to sign a listing agreement and have real property or a cooperative apartment listed for sale.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens When There is a Specific Bequest </strong><strong>Of Real Property in A Will?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the law in New York State is that where real property is devised (given) to a specifically named individual (i.e., a devisee) in the Will, then title vests in the individual or individuals named in the Will at the moment of the decedent’s death (see <em>Waxon Realty Corp. v. Rothchild</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3Tx71Hw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Tx71Hw</a>]. This, in most instances, would mean that the named individual(s) would become the owners of such specifically devised real property as tenants in common and that they would automatically have the authority to sell the property. However, this authority to sell would be subject to claims of creditors of the Estate.</p>
<p>Under Section 13-1.1(a) of the EPTL “[a]ll of the property of a decedent, and any income therefrom in the course of Estate administration, is chargeable with the payment of: (1) Administration and reasonable funeral expenses, debts of the decedent and any taxes for which the estate is liable.” While the specific devisees take title immediately upon the decedent’s death, they need to be informed that the executor has broad powers to take control of Estate assets in order to pay expenses, liabilities, and debts of the Estate. Again, it is important that the advice of Estate counsel is sought in order to confirm what will need to be done in order to be able to list the property for sale. In many instances, particularly where there are mortgages or debts involved, title companies will require that an executor be officially appointed so that they may provide insurable title to a prospective purchaser on a real estate transaction.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the above only applies to specific devises of real property. Where there is a specific devise of a cooperative apartment in a Will, a probate proceeding will be required to be commenced and an executor appointed in order to be able to sell the apartment. Again, the shares in a cooperative apartment are considered personal property and the immediate vesting that occurs with real property does not apply to shares or other personal property.</p>
<p><strong>What if Real Property is Owned </strong><strong>By a Company Owned by a Decedent?</strong></p>
<p>Where a decedent owned shares in a corporation, limited liability or other entity at the time of decedent’s death, there are many issues that need to be addressed and carefully researched. Before any real property can be distributed or sold, an Executor or Administrator must be appointed. Even where real property is specifically devised in a Will, if the real property is owned by a company and the shares, stock, membership interest or other interest representing that ownership interest was owned by the decedent at the time of decedent’s death, those shares, stock, membership units, etc. are personal property and can only be transferred by a duly appointed Executor or Administrator.</p>
<p>Other important documents that will need to be reviewed are the shareholder’s agreement, operating agreement, partnership agreement or other form of ownership agreement. These documents may contain specific provisions as to how the transfer of ownership interests take place upon the death of an owner. It is important to note that the Estate will be bound by the terms contained in any such agreements. These agreements are usually very complex and will, in most instances, require the advice of counsel.</p>
<p><strong>What if Real Property is Owned by the Decedent’s Trust?</strong></p>
<p>When real property is owned by a Trust established by the decedent during the decedent’s lifetime, customarily the disposition of real or personal property (including the transfer of shares in a cooperative corporation) can take place immediately. A Trustee, under the terms of a Trust, is provided with broad powers, which customarily include the authorization to sell, lease, hold, maintain or dispose of all personal and real property. However, before any Trustee proceeds with the disposition of assets owned by the Trust, the terms of the Trust Agreement must be reviewed carefully. Trusts usually include many complex provisions and a Trustee, who is a fiduciary (as are real estate licensees), must strictly adhere to and implement the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>The Complexities of Representing the Estate Client</strong></p>
<p>When representing the representatives of an Estate, or the Trustees of a Trust, in connection with the sale of real property and cooperative apartments, there are a myriad of complex issues that exist and should not be taken lightly. It is essential that real estate licensees and real estate attorneys have a basic knowledge of these issues so they may be able to refer clients to experienced estate attorneys who can guide the clients, agents, and real estate attorneys through these complicated issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON—The burgeoning movie and television production industry in the Hudson Valley could be getting larger as a major “green” television-movie studio project in Hastings-on-Hudson is now in the approval process.</p>
<p>Executives with Atlanta-based Electric Owl Studios made a presentation before the village’s Board of Trustees last evening (Nov. 15) on its $100-million television/movie studio project to be developed at the Graham Windham School property at 1 South Broadway.</p>
<p>The plan calls for Electric Owl Studios to purchase approximately 20 acres of the 24-acre Graham Windham School property. The school, which began operations in Manhattan in 1806 and opened its Hastings campus in 1902, will retain approximately four acres to continue to operate day programs on the Hastings property. Graham Windham closed its dormitory facilities due to COVID and put the property on the market for sale. Graham Windham, which also has multiple locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, is an intensive elementary, middle, and high school (K-12) serving approximately 300 day-students referred by local school districts across the New York Metropolitan area and operated by the Greenburgh-Graham Union Free School District.</p>
<p>No financial terms of the transaction for the 20 acres, which is in contract, were disclosed. John Barrett, managing director investment sales for RM Friedland, is marketing the property on behalf of Graham Windham. Henri Kessler of Marcus &amp; Millichap is representing Electric Owl Studios in the deal. Barrett had no comment on the development proposal and property sale when contacted by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>.</p>
<p>Electric Owl Co-Founders Michael Hahn and Dan Rosenfelt, along with Ben Ruswick of Michael Maltzan Architecture and William Null of the law firm Cuddy &amp; Feder LLP, detailed the firm’s plan for the property at the Nov. 15th Board of Trustees session. The plan calls for the takeover of the Graham Windham administration building and the construction of six studio buildings totaling approximately 20,000 square feet each. Full build-out would total approximately 300,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Hahn said the project will include many “green” features including solar green roofs and green border walls. He said Electric Owl’s intent is to transform the Hastings property into the “greenest studio in the world.” Electric Owl is currently constructing a $60-million television-movie studio in Atlanta that is certified LEED Gold. Hahn said he is hopeful the Hastings development can achieve a higher LEED designation.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, Hahn said that the buildings would be leased to major production studios such as Netflix, Amazon, etc. The property is currently zoned R-20 for residential use. Therefore, Hastings-on-Hudson Mayor Nicola Armacost said that Electric Owl will need to file for a zone change.</p>
<p>The project would generate between $2.5 million to $3 million annually in tax revenues for the Village of Hastings, Hahn noted. The firm is not seeking any tax abatements in connection with the project.</p>
<p>Mayor Armacost said that the Board of Trustees&#8217; initial view of the project is favorable, but she suggested that Electric Owl meet with key stakeholders from the community so that it can address any issues they might have. If a zone change is secured, the applicant would then have to seek site plan approval from the village before construction could commence.</p>
<p>Hahn said that Electric Owl, which has already secured some financial commitments for the Hastings studio project, would like to close on the purchase of the property and begin construction sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>In September 2021, Electric Owl sold its studios on a former General Motors site in the Atlanta suburb of Doraville, GA for $27.5 million, according to a report in the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>. Electric Owl has commenced construction on its new studio project in Atlanta that will total 320,000 square feet. Those facilities should be open and operational in May 2023, Hahn said.</p>
<p>Electric Owl had looked at properties in Brooklyn and elsewhere in the Hudson Valley and other areas. Hahn said, “But at the end of the day we love this town. We love Hastings-on-Hudson.”</p>
<p>If the project secures approval, it will join a host of movie-studio ventures in nearby Yonkers, including the 5000,000-square-foot Lions Gate Studios Yonkers, and others in the Hudson Valley.</p>

Year-over-year, sales dropped by 28.4% (down from 6.19 million in October 2021).]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales retreated for the ninth straight month in October, according to the National Association of Realtors. All four major U.S. regions registered month-over-month and year-over-year declines. Northeast home sales fell 6.6% last month as compared to September 2022 and 23% from October 2021.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—decreased 5.9% from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.43 million in October. Year-over-year, sales dropped by 28.4% (down from 6.19 million in October 2021).</p>
<p>“More potential homebuyers were squeezed out from qualifying for a mortgage in October as mortgage rates climbed higher,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The impact is greater in expensive areas of the country and in markets that witnessed significant home price gains in recent years.”</p>
<p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of October was 1.22 million units, which was down 0.8% from both September and one year ago (1.23 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.3-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.1 months in September and 2.4 months in October 2021.<a href="https://backstream.live/">backstream</a></p>
<p>“Inventory levels are still tight, which is why some homes for sale are still receiving multiple offers,” Yun added. “In October, 24% of homes received over the asking price. Conversely, homes sitting on the market for more than 120 days saw prices reduced by an average of 15.8%.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in October was $379,100, a gain of 6.6% from October 2021 ($355,700), as prices rose in all regions. This marks 128 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 21 days in October, up from 19 days in September and 18 days in October 2021. Sixty-four percent of homes sold in October 2022 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 28% of sales in October, down from 29% in both September 2022 and October 2021. NAR’s 2022 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released earlier this month—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 26%, the lowest since NAR began tracking the data.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 26% of transactions in October, up from 22% in September and 24% in October 2021.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in October, up from 15% in September, but down from 17% in October 2021.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 1% of sales in October, down from 2% in September and identical to October 2021.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.90% in October, up from 6.11% in September. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.</p>
<p>“Mortgage rates have come down since peaking in mid-November, so home sales may be close to reaching the bottom in the current housing cycle,” Yun said.</p>
<p>Realtor.com’s Market Trends Report in October showed that the largest year-over-year median list price growth occurred in Milwaukee (+34.5%), Miami (+25.1%) and Kansas City (+21.4%). Phoenix reported the highest increase in the share of homes that had prices reduced compared to last year (+35.9 percentage points), followed by Austin (+31.2 percentage points) and Las Vegas (+24.4 percentage points).</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95 million in October, down 6.4% from 4.22 million in September and 28.2% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $384,900 in October, up 6.2% from October 2021.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 480,000 units in October, down 2.0% from September and 30.4% from the previous year. The median existing condo price was $331,000 in October, an annual increase of 10.1%.</p>
<p>“For consumers looking to buy or sell a home, having a Realtor by their side to navigate one of the more challenging and complex markets we’ve seen in some time will be essential to successfully completing transactions,” said NAR President Kenny Parcell, a Realtor from Spanish Fork, Utah, and broker-owner of Equity Real Estate UT. “Realtors understand local market conditions and provide timely and trusted advice, from listing to closing.”</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast trailed off 6.6% from September to an annual rate of 570,000 in October, a decline of 23.0% from October 2021. The median price in the Northeast was $408,700, an increase of 8.0% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Midwest retracted 5.3% from the previous month to an annual rate of 1,080,000 in October, falling 25.5% from the prior year. The median price in the Midwest was $274,500, up 5.9% from October 2021.</p>
<p>In the South, existing-home sales declined 4.8% in October from September to an annual rate of 1,980,000, a 27.2% decrease from this time last year. The median price in the South was $346,300, an increase of 8.0% from one year ago.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West waned 9.1% from September to an annual rate of 800,000 in October, down 37.5% from one year ago. The median price in the West was $588,400, a 5.3% increase from October 2021.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—If the last few years have taught real estate practitioners anything, it is the old saying that “All real estate is local” is very short-sighted. With the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide inflation and the Russian invasion of Ukraine as key evidence, the influence of global events and trends play a critical part in the health of real estate in the New York region and the United States.</p>
<p>With that in mind, nine Realtor associations, including the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, held the 16th Annual Global Real Estate Summit on Oct. 20 at the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City. The day-long event was filled with cutting-edge programming that included presentations on: “Emerging Trends in Architecture &amp; Design: Passive House Design &amp; Smart Buildings,” “Global Tax Issues,” “Industry Insights in the Global Commercial Market,” “Tri-State Economic Development Initiatives Update,” “Foreign Visas, Opportunity Zones, EB-5,” “Building Global Strategic Partnerships,” “Digital Technologies, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency &amp; the Metaverse,” as well as an informative and stirring keynote speech by Greg Lindsay, chief communications officer of Climate Alpha on “Utopia, Dystopia and Everything in Between.”</p>
<p>The sponsors of the Global Real Estate Summit were: the Brooklyn MLS, Connecticut Realtors, Greater Bergen Realtors, the Greenwich (CT) Association of Realtors, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, the North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, the Staten Island Board of Realtors, Inc., the New York State Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors. Supporting associations were the Liberty Board of Realtors and the Long Island Board of Realtors.</p>
<div id="attachment_42847" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42847" class="wp-image-42847" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Global-Conference-lead-photo.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-42847" class="wp-caption-text">Tony D’Anzica, HGAR President Elect and Global Business Council Co-Chair</p></div>
<p>Chief officials of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors were keenly involved in the programming, with HGAR President-elect and co-chair of the Global Council Committee Tony D’Anzica offering opening remarks as well as serving as moderator for the Emerging Trends in Architecture panel discussion. 2022 HGAR President Anthony Domathoti moderated the Industry Insights in the Global Commercial Market, while HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty moderated the Tri-State Economic Development Initiatives Update program.</p>
<p>Some of the many takeaways from the Global Real Estate Conference were:</p>
<p>Jeffrey Berman, licensed real estate broker, commercial division with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, New York Properties, a panelist on the Commercial Markets panel, said the “jury is still out” on the impact of corporate return to work programs on the New York City area market.</p>
<p>“Many of the employees have moved, not only outside of the five boroughs, but they have moved outside of the metropolitan area and they have moved across the country because the virtual work has allowed them to do that,” Berman said. “As these companies require people to come back to work, there is going to be an interesting dilemma on whether those people return or if they are replaced?”</p>
<p>Berman predicted that the strongest commercial sector will continue to be the industrial market, while he believes that office market will start to rebound in the coming months. Raymond Chan, broker of record for Warwick Realty Group in Toronto, said the growth markets will continue to be industrial, office and apartment sectors, while headwinds will remain for the retail industry.</p>
<p>Samuel I. Mizrahi, associate broker with Century 21 Mizrahi Realty in Brooklyn, said, “Multifamily is growing very rapidly and I think that will be a very strong market in the next two or three years,” he said. However, he believes that despite its current troubles, retail will rebound.</p>
<div id="attachment_42848" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42848" class="wp-image-42848" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/global-conference-pic-3.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-42848" class="wp-caption-text">From Left: Representing the Global Summit Host and Supporting Associations, Alejandro Escudero, Director, Global Strategy, Engagement, National Associtaion of REALTORS®, Sharon von Schoenber, Manager, Global Strategy and Relations, Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), Anthony Domathoti, President, HGAR Richard Haggerty, CEO, HGAR Harriet Robinson, President, Brooklyn Board of REALTORS®, Tony D’Anzica, President Elect and Co-Chair, Global Business Council, HGAR, Brid Mortamais, Chairperson, International Committee, Greenwich Association of REALTORS®, Bryan Tunney, President, Greenwich Association of REALTORS®, Bill Flagg, President, North Central Jersey Association of REALTORS®, David Bennett, CEO, Pinellas REALTOR® Organization and Jorge Ledesman, CEO, Greater Bergen REALTORS®.</p></div>
<p>The key takeaway from the Tri-State Economic Development Initiatives Update panel discussion is that business investment interest in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is strong, despite the current economic climate. The panel featured Bridget Gibbons, director of economic development for Westchester County; Alexandra Daum, deputy commissioner, chief investment officer of the Connecticut Department of Economic &amp; Community Development and Steve Milgrom, business advocate for the New Jersey Business Action Center.</p>
<p>All spoke of the strong multifamily, life sciences and film industry sectors in their respective markets. Gibbons explained, “I think businesses don’t locate in Westchester or expand in Westchester because it is inexpensive, they do because of proximity (to New York City), our workforce, lifestyle, quality of life and the many other amenities we have.”</p>
<p>She noted that while Westchester County has a shortage of apartments for its workforce, there is a pipeline of 13,000 units combined to be developed in the cities of New Rochelle and White Plains.</p>
<p>All of the economic development officials said they do expect future interest in their locations due to the massive federal investment from the $280-billion Chips and Science Act that has prompted significant investment already in New York State by Micron ($100 billion) and IBM ($20 billion). However, all said that while they have seen some interest, no major deals were in the offing as yet.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Instead, with the housing market beginning a gradual adjustment that could last through 2025, what next year will offer buyers is less competition for a growing number of for-sale homes.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>SANTA CLARA, CA—Amid higher mortgage rates and budgets squeezed by inflation, homebuyers looking for affordability in 2023 will find that prices aren&#8217;t coming down, according to the Realtor.com 2023 Housing Forecast released on Nov. 30. Instead, with the housing market beginning a gradual adjustment that could last through 2025, what next year will offer buyers is less competition for a growing number of for-sale homes.</p>
<p>Overall, in <a href="https://jobdokan.com/">2023</a>, Realtor.com forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average mortgage rates of 7.4%, with early 2023 hikes followed by a slight retreat to 7.1% by year-end.</li>
<li>Home sales prices won&#8217;t come down, but growth will moderate to a single-digit yearly pace (+5.4%) for the first time since 2020.</li>
<li>Rents (+6.3% year-over-year) will outpace home prices and likely hit new highs, further adding to budget pressures—especially for first-time buyers.</li>
<li>An increase in existing homes for sale (+22.8% year-over-year), as the inventory refresh that began last summer accelerates.</li>
<li>Home sales will decline 14.1% year-over-year to 4.53 million, the lowest level since 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>Realtor.com predicts that for the New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-PA market, home sales will rise 1.8% and home prices will increase by 5% in 2023.</p>
<p>“Compared to the wild ride of the past two years, 2023 will be a slower-paced housing market, which means drastic shifts like price declines may not happen as quickly as some have anticipated. It will be a challenging year for both buyers and sellers, but an important one in setting the stage for home sales to return to a sustainable pace over the next two to three years,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com. “With mortgage rates continuing to climb as the Fed navigates the economy to a softish landing, higher costs will lead to fewer closings, but that doesn&#8217;t mean homebuying will stop entirely in 2023. Americans who are determined to make a move will find that staying up-to-date on the market, flexibility, creativity and a healthy dose of patience will go a long way toward success in the year ahead.”</p>
<p>Key 2023 housing trends and wildcards:</p>
<p>A second wind in the second half. Although home sales are expected to slow overall in 2023, Realtor.com’s forecast points to the possibility of a second wind in buying activity in the second half of the year. With mortgage rate hikes projected to continue through March, the Spring season will likely be less busy than in a typical year as buyers and sellers recalibrate their expectations around smaller budgets. This break could provide space for demand to renew as mortgage rates dip later in the year, when home shoppers will also have more options and bargaining power.</p>
<p>A trifecta of budget barriers awaits buyers. In 2023, incomes are expected to grow (+3.9%), but not enough to offset higher mortgage rates (7.4%) and home prices (+5.4%), creating a trifecta of budget barriers. The typical monthly mortgage payment will be $2,430, 28% higher than in 2022, which will likely price many home shoppers out of the market. This will especially be a concern for first-time buyers. As rents will likely reach new highs, it will leave less room for saving towards a down payment. At the same time, some home shoppers may consider exploring new financial options like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), a trend that has already begun to take shape in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>It Isn&#8217;t &#8217;08 </strong></p>
<p>During the mid-2000s housing boom, home sales were elevated for more than five years, and it took another five years for home sales to recover from the economic aftermath. Comparatively, mortgage rate hikes have brought a quicker but less dramatic end to the recent frenzy, during which buyers have been better qualified than in &#8217;08. Moving forward, home price growth will slow and may even decline periodically as prices largely stabilize over the next two-to-three years. The homeownership rate is predicted to hold in 2023, the Realtor.com report stated.</p>
<p>In 2023, the typical homeowner is projected to gain $25,650 in equity as prices keep rising. With real estate wealth already much higher than pre-COVID, these trends offer a positive reality check for sellers who have been increasingly pessimistic about entering the market as listing prices have pulled back from last year&#8217;s peak. While bidding wars won&#8217;t be the norm in 2023, sellers who have owned their home for a longer period of time are still likely to make a profit. Also, those living in relatively affordable areas may still command offers above asking, driven by continued home shopper interest in relocating to lower-priced markets.</p>
<p><strong>2023 Puts the ‘Wild’ In Wildcards</strong></p>
<p>Political and economic events can always shake up the housing outlook, as was the case with major financial shifts in 2022. Along with factors including supply chain disruptions and the conflict in Ukraine, markets have largely begun to adjust for these changes, such as with the Fed&#8217;s efforts to combat inflation with rate hikes. As such, forecasted 2023 housing trends don&#8217;t anticipate a major shakeup like a recession, but it&#8217;s still a possibility, the report stated. Buyers and sellers should keep an eye out for risk signs like a substantial weakening in the jobs market, beyond the mild uptick in unemployment that is projected, as businesses are potentially disrupted by shifting geopolitical, financial and economic conditions. Although a potential recession may lead to lower mortgage rates, ultimately buyers&#8217; purchasing power would suffer. And for sellers, this would likely mean less demand and potential price drops.</p>
<p>“Of the many factors that are expected to affect the housing market in 2023, affordability tops the list of issues most likely to make or break buyers&#8217; plans. Still, our forecast does offer promise for home shoppers who are well-prepared. Tools like Realtor.com&#8217;s Buying Power can help you understand how various rate changes and options impact your budget, and seamlessly integrate into the home search experience to help you stay on track financially,” Hale added.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>An essential and important element of any real estate transaction is the agreement entered into by the parties. There are a variety of agreements that are entered into by the various parties in a real estate transaction, such as the listing or agency agreement between the seller and the seller’s agent, the agency agreement between a purchaser and purchaser’s agent and the formal contract of sale entered into between a seller and purchaser relating to the ultimate sale of the property.</p>
<p>While there are certain exceptions where a written agreement is not required, such as a real estate brokerage agreement (discussed further below), it is always recommended that a clear and definitive agreement be entered into so that the rights and remedies of the parties are clearly set forth within the “four corners” of the agreement. In the event of a dispute, the parties will know exactly what their rights are and what remedies are available to them. In <em>Savignano v. Play</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3VO8xqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3VO8xqz</a>), the Appellate Division strictly applied the four corners doctrine in overturning the lower court’s decision.</p>
<p><strong>All Real Estate Contracts &amp; Leases Longer Than </strong><strong>One Year Must in be Writing Under N.Y. GOL § 5-70</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the Statute of Frauds is a legal principle, which requires that agreements, with certain exceptions, be memorialized in writing in order for the agreement to be valid and enforceable. Under the New York General Obligations Law (N.Y. GOL) § 5-703[2] [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3kZeUqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3kZeUqo</a>] “A contract for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale, of any real property, or an interest therein, is void unless the contract or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consideration, is in writing, subscribed by the party to be charged, or by his lawful agent thereunto authorized by writing.” Therefore, all leases over a year and real estate contracts are required to be in writing.</p>
<p><strong>Exception to the Statute of Frauds When It Comes to </strong><strong>The Payment of Real Estate Broker Commissions</strong></p>
<p>Under N.Y. GOL § 5-701(10), there is a specific exception allowed for real estate agents. It provides that the requirement that an agreement be in writing “…shall not apply to a contract to pay compensation to an auctioneer, an attorney at law, or a duly licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman.” Therefore, if any of the aforementioned parties render services to a client and are able to establish that such an implied or oral agreement exists, they will be entitled to payment for the services provided. For example, a real estate broker may be entitled to a commission based upon the actions of the parties or even a verbal agreement. While it is strongly recommended to have a written or “express” agreement, at times a party may refuse to sign one or the parties may elect not to enter into a formal written agreement.</p>
<p>It is well established under New York case law that “in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a real estate broker will be deemed to have earned his commission when he produces a buyer who is ready, willing and able to purchase at the terms set by the seller” (see <em>Lane-Real Estate Dept. Store v Lawlet Corp. </em>at <a href="https://bit.ly/2C5xiIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2C5xiIA</a>). Further, a real estate broker is entitled to a commission where the broker can establish “that it (1) is duly licensed, (2) had a contract, express or implied, with the party to be charged with paying the commission, and (3) was the procuring cause of the transaction.” The above standards are fact-intensive and will usually involve a careful review of the circumstances and evidence surrounding each case.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Four Corners’ Doctrine Under Contract Law</strong></p>
<p>Courts will customarily adhere to the “four corners” doctrine in contract disputes. If the rights and duties of the parties are clearly and unambiguously enumerated in the “four corners” of the agreement, courts will customarily interpret and apply those provisions strictly. Therefore, it is very important, even where a written agreement is not required under the law, that all parties enter into a written agreement so that all of the essential rights, duties, and obligations of, and remedies available to, the parties are included within the document.</p>
<p><strong><em>Savignano v. Play</em></strong><strong>: The Importance of a Clear </strong><strong>And Unambiguous Agreement</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facts</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Savignano v. Play</em>, the parties entered into negotiations for the purchase and sale of real property. On May 11, 2020, the purchaser (the plaintiff), transmitted a signed form contract to the sellers (one of whom was the defendant). The contract contained two contingencies. One contingency consisted of an “attorney approval” provision, which required the parties to obtain approval by their respective attorneys as to the contract terms. The second contingency consisted of an inspection contingency.</p>
<p>The attorney approval contingency was deemed waived if the attorneys did not notify each other of their disapproval, in writing, by May 20, 2020. The inspection contingency would also be deemed waived unless the purchaser notified the sellers of any issues discovered during the inspections. The court explained that if the “plaintiff did so notify the sellers, and provided a copy of the relevant inspection report, then the agreement would be deemed cancelled and plaintiff&#8217;s deposit returned, unless plaintiff elected to defer such cancellation for 10 days to permit the parties an opportunity to come to a written agreement on the inspection issue.”</p>
<p>On May 12, 2020, plaintiff&#8217;s attorney transmitted an additional purchaser’s rider to the seller’s attorney. On May 13, 2020, the sellers signed the original contract, and it was then transmitted to the purchaser. The sellers, however, did not sign or return the additional rider. The plaintiff&#8217;s attorney then confirmed with the sellers’ attorney on May 18<sup>th</sup>, that the signed contract was received. The purchaser’s attorney also asked about the proposed rider as well as several other documents relating to the title search, but the seller’s attorney did not respond specifically to this enquiry.</p>
<p>Nearly a month later, on June 17, 2020, the purchaser’s attorney notified the sellers’ attorney, in writing, that the purchaser conducted his inspections and that the “inspection had revealed an inadequate well water flow rate and numerous electrical problems.” The court pointed out that the purchaser’s attorney informed the seller’s attorney that the inspections results were “totally unsatisfactory” and “not acceptable” to purchaser. The purchaser’s attorney further advised the sellers’ attorney that the “well would need to be redrilled, and that if there was no adjustment in the purchase price to account for the redrilling, then plaintiff would ‘abandon’ the contract.” As required by the contract, the court pointed out that the inspection report was also provided to the sellers.</p>
<p>On June 25, 2020, the sellers’ attorney notified the purchaser’s attorney that the sellers would not be performing any repairs because the property was being sold in its “as is” condition, and asked whether the purchaser would be proceeding. Over two weeks later, on July 12, 2020, the purchaser’s real estate agent emailed the sellers’ attorney indicating that plaintiff was willing to accept the property “as is” and proceed with the transaction. However, one brother, the defendant in the action, informed his agent and attorney that he did not wish to proceed with the sale. The other brother, instead, informed the attorney that he did wish to proceed with the sale.</p>
<p>On Aug. 3, 2020, the purchaser’s attorney sent a “time of the essence” letter to the seller’s attorney and set a TOE closing date of Sept. 4, 2020. The defendant then engaged a new attorney who sent a rejection of the TOE letter on August 12<sup>th</sup>, and “asserted that there existed no valid contract, and indicated that there would be no closing.” The purchaser also retained a new attorney who then rejected the defendant’s attorney’s correspondence, and commenced the lawsuit against the sellers for breach of contract, and sought specific performance. After the lawsuit was filed, the defendant purchased the interest of his brother and this is why only one defendant was named in the lawsuit at the time of the appeal.</p>
<p><strong>The Appellate Division’s Analysis in Savignano</strong></p>
<p>The lower court, at the summary judgment stage, “found that a valid contract existed between the parties which had not been canceled via any contingency. The court further determined that defendant&#8217;s failure to proceed with the transaction constituted a breach of contract, entitling plaintiff to damages for which a trial would be appropriate.” The defendant appealed the decision of the lower (trial) court.</p>
<p><strong>Offer, Counteroffer, and Acceptance </strong></p>
<p>Although the Appellate Division agreed with the trial court that there existed a valid and enforceable contract, it ultimately disagreed with the finding that the contract had not been cancelled. The Appellate Division explained that “it is a fundamental principle of contract law that a valid acceptance must comply with the terms of the offer…and a purported acceptance that does not comply with the offer&#8217;s terms is ‘equivalent to a rejection and counteroffer.’” The Appellate Division pointed out that when the purchaser’s transmitted the signed contract along with the proposed rider, that constituted an offer. The sellers then “counteroffered by signing and returning to plaintiff only the form contract without the rider. Plaintiff then accepted the counteroffer by proceeding with the inspections, as ‘a counteroffer may be accepted by conduct.’” The Appellate Division further held that the May 18<sup>th</sup> letter transmitted by the purchaser’s attorney in no way “signaled disapproval.”</p>
<p><strong>Four Corners Doctrine: Strict Adherence to Contract Terms</strong></p>
<p>The Appellate Division, in determining whether the contract was ultimately cancelled, applied a strict interpretation of the contract’s terms and adhered strictly to the provisions contained within the “four corners” of the agreement. The Appellate Division explained that in accordance with the contract, the purchaser’s attorney, in his June 17<sup>th</sup> letter, “notified the sellers&#8217; attorney that the property had failed multiple inspections, and provided a copy of the relevant inspection report.” The Appellate Division explained that “this conduct, in accordance with the language set forth in the inspection contingency, rendered the contract ‘cancelled, null and void’ unless plaintiff chose to defer cancellation for 10 days.”</p>
<p>The Appellate Court then went on to explain that since the purchaser, in the June 17<sup>th</sup> letter, requested that the seller resolve the issues, the purchaser validly exercised the “option” to defer the cancellation for 10 days. However, since no written agreement was reached by the parties as to the resolution of the inspection issues within the 10-day period, the contract automatically cancelled “by operation of the inspection contingency.” The court also pointed out that the purchaser’s broker failed to e-mail the seller’s attorney in a timely manner. The e-mail sent by the purchaser’s agent that the purchaser was willing to proceed with the purchase in its “as is” condition was sent on July 12<sup>th</sup>, which was beyond the 10-day period provided for in the contract of sale. Accordingly, the Appellate Division, adhering to the “four corners” doctrine, reversed the decision of the lower court and held that the contract had been cancelled and was null and void.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Strict Adherence to the Contract Terms</strong></p>
<p>It is clear to see the importance of having a clear and unambiguous written agreement in place for all aspects of a real estate transaction. The decision in Savignano also points out the importance of strictly adhering to the terms of any agreement as important rights may be waived or lost if not done. In Savignano, the purchaser allowed the contract to cancel automatically because the purchaser did not provide timely notice, and ultimately lost the property. This also caused the purchaser to incur additional legal fees and costs as a result.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—What was evident from the forecasts from noted real estate economists, including National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, at yesterday’s Real Estate Forecast Summit is that while 2023 will be a difficult year for many, it will in no way mirror the severe downturn the industry suffered in 2008.</p>
<p>Yun, forecasts that 4.78 million existing homes will be sold, prices will remain stable, and Atlanta will be the top real estate market to watch in 2023 and beyond. Yun unveiled the association&#8217;s forecast on Tuesday during NAR&#8217;s fourth annual year-end virtual Real Estate Forecast Summit.</p>
<p>He also offered some good news for real estate professionals and prospective homebuyers as he believes mortgage rates have hit their peak after eclipsing 7% in late 2022. Yun expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to settle at 5.7% as the Fed slows the pace of rate hikes to control inflation. He also noted the 2023 rate is lower than the pre-pandemic historical rate of 8%.</p>
<p>Yun’s prediction for mortgage rates in 2023 is significantly lower than some other economists. For example, Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com, predicts the average mortgage interest rate for 2023 will be 7.4% and will end the year at 7.1%.</p>
<p>Yun predicts home sales will decline by 6.8% compared to 2022 (5.13 million) and the median home price will reach $385,800 – an increase of just 0.3% from this year ($384,500).</p>
<p>&#8220;Half of the country may experience small price gains, while the other half may see slight price declines,&#8221; Yun said. &#8220;However, markets in California may be the exception, with San Francisco, for example, likely to register price drops of 10–15%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yun expects rent prices to rise 5% in 2023, following a 7% increase in 2022. He predicts foreclosure rates will remain at historically low levels in 2023, comprising less than 1% of all mortgages.</p>
<p>Yun forecasts U.S. GDP will grow by 1.3%, roughly half the typical historical pace of 2.5%.</p>
<p>At the summit, NAR also released its Top 10 Real Estate Markets to Watch in 2023 and into the Future.” They were:</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA</strong><br />
<strong> Raleigh, NC</strong><br />
<strong> Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX</strong><br />
<strong> Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR, MI</strong><br />
<strong> Greenville-Anderson-Mauldin, SC</strong><br />
<strong> Charleston-North Charleston, SC</strong><br />
<strong> Huntsville, AL</strong><br />
<strong> Jacksonville, FL</strong><br />
<strong> San Antonio-New Braunfels-TX</strong><br />
<strong> Knoxville, TN</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The demand for housing continues to outpace supply,&#8221; Yun said. &#8220;The economic conditions in place in the top 10 U.S. markets, all of which are located in the South, provide the support for home prices to climb by at least 5% in 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>NAR selected the top 10 real estate markets to watch in 2023 based on how they compared to the national average on the following economic indicators: 1) better housing affordability; 2) greater numbers of renters who can afford to buy a median-priced home; 3) stronger job growth; 4) faster growth of information industry jobs; 5) higher shares of the information industry in the respective local GDPs; 6) migration gains; 7) shares of workers teleworking; 8) faster population growth; 9) faster growth of active housing inventory; and 10) smaller housing shortages.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the parking lot at the White Plains Mall was filled with shoppers and diners who were patrons of such Downtown White Plains staples as Scotch &amp; Sirloin, Dag’s Tavern, Wallauer Paint &amp; Design, McDonald’s and in the later years Bob Hyland’s The Sports Page. For a time, many in the region had to renew their licenses or register their cars at the Westchester County Department of Motor Vehicles, which had offices there.</p>
<p>However, competition from The Galleria at White Plains, The Westchester and other negative influences took their toll and parking spaces at The White Plains Mall have not been at a premium for years. Eventually, the ownership of the property went before the City of White Plains for approvals of a large mixed-use project at the property and for incentives from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency to help offset construction costs. In 2020, the ownership of the White Plains Mall secured $17.5 million in sales tax and mortgage recording tax exemptions from the Westchester County IDA.</p>
<p>After some delay, construction has officially commenced on Hamilton Green, a $650-millon mixed-use project that will be undertaken in phases. On Dec. 8, city and county dignitaries joined RXR and The Cappelli Organization to break ground on the project. While site work has commenced, the ceremony included the symbolic dismantling of The White Plains Mall sign.</p>
<p>At full build-out the project will feature four residential tower buildings that will total 860 rental units, including 78 affordable units, open space as well as approximately 84,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
<p>Located two blocks from the White Plains Metro North Train Station and one block from the White Plains Central Business District, phase one of Hamilton Green calls for the construction of two residential buildings: 7 Cottage—a 12-story, 162-unit building, and 240 Hamilton—a 25-story, 308-unit tower. The phase one component includes a 515-space underground parking garage, nearly 523,000 square feet of residential space, approximately 55,000 square feet of open space and nearly 39,000 square feet of retail space. Phase I is slated for completion in 2025.</p>
<p>Phase II will include 390 residential units, 441 self-park parking spaces and 45,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
<div id="attachment_42992" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42992" class="wp-image-42992" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sign-demolition-.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="241" /><p id="caption-attachment-42992" class="wp-caption-text">The demolition of the White Plains Mall sign.</p></div>
<p>“We are incredibly excited to break ground on the first phase of Hamilton Green. This is a unique opportunity to develop our first project in White Plains and convert a defunct shopping mall into a much-needed, 470-unit mixed-use residential community and commercial site. With this being our fifth residential project in Westchester County, we are heartened by the lessons we’ve learned and relationships we’ve fostered to continue offering residents a highly amenitized living experience at a significant discount to New York City rents,” said Joseph Graziose, Senior Vice President of Residential Development at RXR. “We look forward to co-developing this project with The Cappelli Organization, advancing local hiring initiatives, and building thoughtful community partnerships in the vibrant White Plains community.”</p>
<p>“We are very excited to again partner with RXR on this new development. Since our first joint project in 1998, we have developed world-class residential and retail projects with the latest technological innovation and state-of-the-art design. As we move forward in converting this functionally obsolete asset, the project will implement sustainable design features, including an all-electric ready infrastructure and smart home technologies utilizing intelligent thermal controls, dynamic glass and high efficiency mechanical systems, further promoting health and wellness for the building and its tenants,” said Louis Cappelli, Founder of The Cappelli Organization. “The Hamilton Green development will be a terrific addition to our portfolio in Westchester County and deserving of its place within the vibrant White Plains downtown district.”</p>
<p>“I would like to thank The Cappelli Organization and RXR for breaking ground on the highly anticipated Hamilton Green development, which will replace the 50-year-old White Plains Mall property” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer. “The ambitious redevelopment plan includes rental units and affordable housing, dining, retail, commercial space and parking, and is situated just two blocks from the White Plains Metro North Rail Station. The reimagining of this space will significantly contribute to the transformation of the downtown area and offer a real benefit to the people who live, visit and work in White Plains.”</p>
<p>White Plains Mayor Thomas Roach noted that redevelopment work is underway on many of the sites that were outdated, underutilized or served as a blight and discouraged pedestrian traffic from the White Plains Metro-North train station to the Downtown District on Mamaroneck Avenue.</p>
<p>Last month, the owner of the 870,000-square-foot Galleria at White Plains—Pacific Retail Capital Partners and Aareal Bank—announced it was bringing on new joint venture partners—SL Green Realty Corp. of New York City and the Cappelli Organization of to “explore mixed uses” and “rebalance the mix of uses” for the property that has fallen on hard times as its two chief anchors—Macy’s and Sears—have both shuttered their stores there. Pacific Retail Capital Partners is headquartered in El Segundo, CA and Aareal Bank is based in Wiesbaden, Germany.</p>
<p>“The City of White Plains seeks to transform idle, underperforming downtown sites into vibrant, pedestrian-friendly spaces. RXR and The Cappelli Organization have partnered to reimagine the underperforming White Plains Mall site into a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, sustainable space that offers diverse housing: luxury, market and affordable; public and private public areas for daily enjoyment by residents; and high-quality retail and restaurants which will create jobs and provide exceptional culinary and shopping experiences,” Mayor Roach said. “The City of White Plains looks forward to the construction of Hamilton Green which will activate this critical, well- positioned site with people and a variety of uses that will be appreciated and enjoyed by the White Plains community.”</p>
<p>Hamilton Green, designed by Lessard Design and MdeAS Architects, will undergo a phased ground up construction process and feature a contemporary design. Exclusive amenities for all residents will also include 24-hour concierge services, resident lounges, co-working spaces, a pool, game rooms, fitness studios, expansive outdoor terraces and a shared public plaza.</p>
<p>RXR closed on the land for the proposed phase one development and The Cappelli Organization closed on the land for the proposed phase two development on Nov. 30, 2022. The White Plains Mall originally opened its doors in 1972 at 200 Hamilton Avenue and was demolished in August 2022, with the exception of its sign bordering Hamilton Avenue.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Usually, as the year comes to a close, I often do a “year in review.” However, this year I’d like to gaze into my crystal ball (actually, it’s a Magic 8 ball) and look at what the future might hold for the real estate industry. As many of you know our industry is under attack by many different factions and for many different reasons. One of those attacks comes in the form of lawsuits related to the way agents receive their income by way of cooperating compensation. If some of these lawsuits are successful, the results may radically change the landscape of how real estate agents do business. So, let’s look deep into my Magic 8 ball and see what 2023 might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Representation of Clients</strong></p>
<p>Years ago, real estate agents represented only the seller. The listing broker represented the homeowner/seller and his/her interests and agents endeavored to list the property for sale and also find a buyer for the seller. With broker agency and sub agency, which was common at the time, the broker for the homeowner sought assistance through other broker/agents to find a buyer. These agents also worked in the best interests of the seller, not the buyer. The agent’s fiduciary duty, like that of the listing broker, was to the homeowner/seller. As for the buyers, they were on their own to fend for themselves. The problem was that most buyers believed their agent (broker or sub agent) was there to protect their interests; however, as explained above, this was not true. As a result, and with government interaction, the creation of the buyer agent came into prominence in the 1980s, with the buyer agent acting in the best interests of the buyer. Since then, any agent must identify to whom they owe their fiduciary duty and therefore the agent representation is, more or less, balanced, with both parties receiving guidance from their respective agents.</p>
<p><strong>Current Compensation Scheme</strong></p>
<p>Under the current cooperating compensation scheme, a homeowner enters into a contract with a listing broker and, in exchange for the work performed, the listing broker is offered a commission. Historically, because the listing broker employed the assistance of other agents to find a buyer (i.e., agents within the brokerage, broker agents, or sub agents), the listing agreement also offered cooperating compensation to any licensee that brought a buyer who was ready, willing and able to purchase. With the inception of buyer agency, cooperating compensation was also extended to a buyer’s agent who might bring a buyer. Today, this offer of cooperating compensation is made through the Multiple Listing Service and it’s offered to any member of the MLS, although any licensee is free to negotiate their own compensation. Under the National Association of Realtors rules, some offer of cooperating compensation must be provided if the listing is on the MLS.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges to the Compensation Scheme</strong></p>
<p>Numerous lawsuits have been filed alleging that the current cooperating compensation scheme is improper and violates various laws. Some assert that the non-negotiable cooperating compensation fee adversely impacts the parties. It’s also alleged that, as a result of the NAR-required offer of cooperating compensation, the purchase price of homes has a “baked in” increase to the purchase price that takes into account the cost of the commissions paid. As a result, buyers are detrimentally impacted. Others argue that because the homeowner wants to incentivize buyer agents into showing the property, the cooperating compensation is being artificially bolstered, thus causing the homeowner to incur excessive costs, which reduces their net profits from the sale of the home. As a result, there are lawsuits that look to “decouple” the commissions and require the buyer and seller to pay only their respective agents. The assertion is that if this is done, the homeowner will pay a lower commission overall, and the buyer will be able to negotiate a more reasonable buyer-side commission; particularly, where they argue that, due to the proliferation of Internet marketing, the buyer’s agent does less (Note: This is their argument and many do not agree with this premise).</p>
<p><strong>Future Problems</strong></p>
<p>While the premise of “decoupling” seems promising, the impact may be problematic. First and foremost, requiring NAR to remove the required cooperating compensation offered on the MLS would certainly upset the current real estate commission model. Without it, buyer agents might be required to negotiate their commissions with their buyer clients (presently, some agents do this and have verbal or written agreements, but they are relatively rare). This prospect might be challenging for some agents, particularly where the public perception is often that the buyer agent does less than the listing agent. It can be even more daunting for the newer agent, where they have less experience to justify their commission.</p>
<p>Second, while the current model is alleged to have commissions that are “baked in” to the sale price, it has the advantage of the seller paying the commissions from the net proceeds of the sale. Even though the buyer is funding the cost of the sale, it is the seller that paid the commissions. As a result, the buyer was usually able to obtain a mortgage, which covered the sale price, presumably with the commissions included. Now, if the situation would be that the buyer was saddled with the burden of paying buyer-side commissions, the question could be raised as to whether a lender will permit commissions be added to the mortgage. Currently, it is rare that lenders will include commissions into a mortgage. This means that with the buyer being unable to finance commissions, the buyer would be required to come up with substantially more cash to purchase (which would also include down payment, title insurance, legal fees, etc.). This could come as a barrier to homeownership to many first-time buyers and marginalized members of the population.</p>
<p>Another outcome to this possible alteration in commission structure could be a change in fiduciary duties, with more and more buyers no longer seeking an agent to assist them with the transaction. This could detrimentally impact the buyer and his/her ability to fairly negotiate a transaction based solely upon the cost associated with the representation. An additional possibility is the resurgence of broker and sub agent representation, which would be unaffected, due to the fact that the seller would continue to fund the cooperating commission. A third outcome could be the increase of “For Sale by Owner” properties, where no agents are involved and no commissions are paid (or they are negotiated with the homeowner/seller). This could be detrimental not only to the real estate industry as a whole for licensees, but it may also have a negative impact on the real estate market and the public as they engage in making, what may be the largest purchase of their lives, with no professional assistance. That becomes a frightening proposition. Alternatively, more office exclusives might become prevalent, as these listings are not on the MLS, no offers of compensation are provided, and they tend to be marketed only to in-house agents, with limited availability to the general buying public.</p>
<p>There are other alternatives as well. Perhaps the suing parties will not prevail. Maybe the inclusion of some “small print” language will be added to contracts to permit cooperating commissions. Perhaps an entirely new structure will be adopted. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Next year will certainly come. Recent news is that one of the main cases, Sitzer v. NAR, et al., which was supposed to be tried in early February/March, is now postponed to a date in late 2023, so we will have to wait to see what happens in that case. If it comes to pass that NAR must revise or remove the cooperating compensation provision in the MLS, the results may not be what the suing parties intended. In the long run, sellers may have to pay more for the sale of their homes. Buyers may not be able to buy. Marginalized members of the community may be further shut out from the prospects of home ownership. Buyers may lose representation and deals may go awry. Regardless, agents will always adapt, irrespective of the disruption, but at what cost?</p>
<p>Currently, my Magic 8 ball, says, “Reply hazy, ask again,” so I’ll ask again in 2023. Stay tuned.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Entering 2022, Realtors interviewed by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> were hopeful that the housing market would remain strong as a follow-up to the feverish sales pace of the previous year, fueled by strong housing demand and the continued influences of the coronavirus pandemic. However, they were fearful that rising interest rates would take their toll on the market. Those fears, in retrospect, were not unfounded.</p>
<p>A passage in the page one story in the January 2021 edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> on the housing market seems prophetic:</p>
<p><em>“After residential sales volume in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area reached historically high levels in 2021, brokers expect continued strong sales activity this year, although not at the feverish pace the industry enjoyed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</em></p>
<p><em>To say there are headwinds facing Realtors and consumers in 2022 would be an understatement, with the prospects for high inflation, rising mortgage interest rates, supply chain problems, the Omicron variant and very low for-sale inventories high on the list.”</em></p>
<p>The following are some of the major stories in the real estate industry in 2022 as reported in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>:</p>
<p><strong>January</strong></p>
<p>HGAR and OneKey MLS recently released the 2021 Fourth Quarter and Annual Residential Real Estate Sales Report Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx Counties, New York. The report noted that residential sales in all markets, with the exception of the Bronx, fell sharply in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. While sales in the Bronx shot up 39.8%, activity in Rockland County fell 10.8%, followed by a 15% drop in sales volume in Westchester County. Orange, Sullivan and Putnam counties saw home sales declines of 15.2%, 18.4% and 25.2% respectively.</p>
<div id="attachment_43063" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43063" class="wp-image-43063" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lionsgate-exterior-2-1024x504.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="197" /><p id="caption-attachment-43063" class="wp-caption-text">One of the more exciting developments in 2022 was the City of Yonkers becoming a player in the movie studio industry in the New York metro region.</p></div>
<p>Great Point Studios officially opened the doors to its long-awaited Lionsgate Studios Yonkers on Jan. 11 at 45 Wells Ave. and announced that it will move forward with a more than $500-million expansion plan nearby.</p>
<p>The expansion project announced by Great Point Studios Founder and CEO Robert Halmi calls for a 1-million-square-foot facility that will feature more than 20,000 square foot stages on one campus, which is larger than any other facility in the Northeast. The campus will include a total of 11 soundstages.</p>
<p><strong>February</strong></p>
<p>A panel of commercial real estate brokers from the New York City/Hudson Valley market that were part of a virtual panel hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors were upbeat about many sectors in 2022, particularly the industrial, flex, health care and medical office segments.</p>
<p>The region’s office market remains troubled as many businesses and building owners continue to contend with work at home programs and preferences by many employees to engage in hybrid office models that only require working at the office a few days a week. One broker, in particular, predicted some radical changes for the Westchester County office market are on the horizon, while another related that the region’s commercial markets are “facing a new paradigm.”</p>
<p>Argent Ventures, a privately held New York City-based investment firm, acquired the twin-tower White Plains Plaza office building here from Ivy Realty of Greenwich, CT and DW Capital of New York City for $105 million. The deal represents the largest single asset office sale in Westchester County since 2010.</p>
<p><strong>March</strong></p>

<p>A contingent of more than 70 members of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and staff traveled to Albany on May 10 to lobby state lawmakers on the organization’s 2022 legislative agenda that included staunch opposition to “Good Cause” eviction and the association’s support for statewide co-op transparency legislation, similar to laws passed in Rockland and Westchester counties recently.</p>
<p>The HGAR delegation was led by Legislative Co-Chair Leah Caro and HGAR President Anthony Domathoti. HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty noted that the program, part of the New York State Association of Realtors Annual Lobby Day, had the most association participants in memory. In addition, HGAR’s session with lawmakers at the State Capital lasted close to two hours and was attended by the most state Assembly members and State Senators in the history of the association’s annual Lobby Day programs.</p>

<p>The sold-out inaugural Diversity, Equity Inclusion (DEI) Summit attracted hundreds of Realtors from across the New York metro region and provided valuable insight into the need for Realtor associations and their members to implement programs and policies that embrace DEI and promote Fair Housing.</p>
<p>The two-day DEI Summit was held at the Sheraton Mahwah on June 13 and 14 and was co-sponsored by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. Other co-sponsors included the National Association of Realtors, the New York State Association of Realtors, New Jersey Realtors, the Greater Bergen Association of Realtors, the Greater Rochester Association of Realtors and the North Central New Jersey Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the staff of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> regretted to inform the membership and newspaper readership of the passing of John Vrooman, who died suddenly on June 5, 2022 at the age of 57 in upstate Lewiston, NY. John authored “Tech Talk” in HGAR’s monthly newspaper <em>Real Estate In-Depth </em>since August 2000. From day one he provided insightful and useful computer and technology advice to the more than 13,000 readers of the newspaper each month.</p>
<p><strong>July </strong></p>
<p>The largest business expansion project in the history of Westchester County became official on June 22. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul joined other state, county and local officials to celebrate the ceremonial groundbreaking of Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc.’s $1.8-billion expansion project at its corporate headquarters campus in Tarrytown/Greenburgh.</p>
<p>The biotechnology company has committed to create at least 1,000 new full-time, high-skill jobs in the Mid-Hudson Region over the next five years. The project will encompass the design, construction and fit out of up to eight buildings, three parking garages and a central utility plant totaling approximately 900,000 square feet.</p>
<p>The residential market in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area, with the exception of the Bronx, saw sharp declines in sales transactions in the second quarter, most posting overall double-digit declines in volume, according to the second quarter home sales report released earlier this month by OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>While sales volume was down in the Hudson Valley counties, median sale prices continued to climb, fueled in large part by the low inventory of homes on the market. In Westchester County, the second quarter single-family home sales of 1,583 declined 14.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021.</p>

<p>Global pharmaceutical firm Pfizer Inc. will spend $470 million to expand its vaccine research and development operations in Pearl River across the Hudson in Rockland County.</p>
<p>Pfizer confirmed to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> on July 22 that it plans over the next three years to secure necessary approvals and expand and modernize its Pearl River campus with a new 260,000-square-foot lab building. The project will feature a total of 55,000 square feet of lab space. The new space is expected to be operational in 2026.</p>
<p>A joint venture of affiliates of Norfolk, VA-based Harbor Group International, LLC and Azure Partners of New York City has acquired the Avalon Green multifamily community in Elmsford—for $306 million. The joint venture announced on July 25 that it would further implement a $9.2-million capital improvement program across the 617-unit community to refresh amenities and common areas and modernize select interior units. Built in three phases in 1995, 2012 and 2016 by AvalonBay Communities, the property features a mix of townhouses, apartment homes and stacked flats.</p>
<p><strong>September</strong></p>
<p>New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James announced the state had reached settlements with three Long Island real estate brokerage firms found to have engaged in discriminatory practices and Fair Housing Law violations first uncovered in an investigation by <em>Newsday</em> in late 2019.</p>
<p>Following the <em>Newsday </em>report, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of State opened parallel investigations into Keller Williams Greater Nassau, Keller Williams Realty Elite and Laffey Real Estate. The probe by the OAG concluded that LRE, KWRE, and KWGN engaged in discriminatory practices that violated state and federal fair housing laws.</p>
<p>The condominium project called “The Daymark” to be built at the Edge on Hudson property—the site of a former General Motors assembly plant—has secured $142 million in financing.</p>
<p>Lionheart Strategic Management LLC, an affiliate of Fisher Brothers that manages capital on behalf of third-party investors, announced on Sept. 7 that it will provide a $37.2-million mezzanine loan behind a $105-million senior loan from Centennial Bank of New York City to a project team comprised of New York City-based Biddle Real Estate Ventures and PCD Development of New Providence, NJ. The financing will be used to develop a 100-unit luxury waterfront condominium building at Edge-on-Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>October</strong></p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed on Oct. 5 what was first reported in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, that the study of the $1-billion Route 17 expansion will take another three years to complete and that construction on the expansion project could not begin at least until then.</p>
<p>In an announcement marking what the governor called a “Major Milestone on Transformative Conversion of State Route 17 into Interstate 86,” she stated that the environmental review process on the project had begun. Much later in the announcement, she did state that the New York State Department of Transportation expects to publish a final Environmental Impact Statement for the project in 2025.</p>
<p>In an interview with Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus in the September edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, the county executive complained that state officials had told him the environmental review would take three years to complete. Neuhaus told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, “I want to see asphalt being put down. I don’t want to see studies. That road has been studied for 60 years.” He later added, “This thing is like ‘Sasquatch,’ it’s like urban folklore that there is going to be a third lane on Route 17,” he said.</p>
<p>Home sales continued to decline in the third quarter of this year as the New York City, Hudson Valley markets grapple with stubborn low inventory levels, high inflation, rising interest rates and home prices.</p>
<p>Overall home sales in the region fell in the fourth quarter of 2021 and now in the first three quarters of 2022. According to the 2022 Third Quarter Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx counties released by OneKey MLS earlier this month, all counties in the HGAR market suffered lower sales in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to a year earlier, with the exception of Sullivan County, which enjoyed a 2.9% increase in overall residential sales.</p>

<p>The long-promised redevelopment plan for The Galleria at White Plains, which was the focal point of the urban renewal of the downtown district in the late 1970s and early 1980s, is taking shape.</p>
<p>While details are still sketchy at best, the owner of the 870,000-square-foot, four-level retail property—Pacific Retail Capital Partners and Aareal Bank—announced on Nov. 3 it was bringing on new joint venture partners—SL Green Realty Corp. of New York City and the Cappelli Organization of White Plains to “explore mixed uses” and “rebalance the mix of uses” for the property that has fallen on hard times as its two chief anchors—Macy’s and Sears have both shuttered their stores there. Pacific Retail Capital Partners is headquartered in El Segundo, CA and Aareal Bank is based in Wiesbaden, Germany.</p>
<p>Executives with Atlanta-based Electric Owl Studios made a presentation before the village’s Board of Trustees on Nov. 15 on its $100-million television/movie studio project to be developed at the Graham Windham School property at 1 South Broadway.</p>
<p>The plan calls for Electric Owl Studios to purchase approximately 20 acres of the 24-acre Graham Windham School property. The school, which began operations in Manhattan in 1806 and opened its Hastings campus in 1902, will retain approximately four acres to continue to operate day programs on the Hastings property. Graham Windham closed its dormitory facilities due to COVID and put the property on the market for sale. Graham Windham, which also has multiple locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, is an intensive elementary, middle, and high school (K-12) serving approximately 300 day-students referred by local school districts across the New York Metropolitan area and operated by the Greenburgh-Graham Union Free School District.</p>
<p>Realtor associations, including the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, held the 16<sup>th</sup> Annual Global Real Estate Summit at the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City. The day-long event was filled with cutting-edge programming that included presentations on: “Emerging Trends in Architecture &amp; Design: Passive House Design &amp; Smart Buildings,” “Global Tax Issues,” “Industry Insights in the Global Commercial Market,” “Tri-State Economic Development Initiatives Update,” “Foreign Visas, Opportunity Zones, EB-5,” “Building Global Strategic Partnerships,” “Digital Technologies, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency &amp; the Metaverse,” as well as an informative and stirring keynote speech by Greg Lindsay, chief communications officer of Climate Alpha on “Utopia, Dystopia and Everything in Between.”</p>
<p>Chief officials of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors were keenly involved in the programming, with HGAR President-elect and co-chair of the Global Council Committee Tony D’Anzica offering opening remarks as well as serving as moderator for the Emerging Trends in Architecture panel discussion. 2022 HGAR President Anthony Domathoti moderated the Industry Insights in the Global Commercial Market, while HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty moderated the Tri-State Economic Development Initiatives Update program.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Richard Haggerty, who has worked in various roles at the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and its predecessor organizations for nearly four decades, will go down in the annals of HGAR’s storied history as the leader who guided it to become a major real estate organization in the New York metro region. In his 10-year tenure as CEO, the association has grown from a membership of approximately 4,000 to more than 14,000 Realtors and affiliates in a six-county region in the Hudson Valley-New York City region.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2012 he has overseen the association’s expansion into Rockland and Orange counties, the Bronx and Manhattan. As he leaves HGAR, the enigmatic Haggerty has a long list of accomplishments, including: being the co-founder of the regional OneKey MLS, along with Jim Speer; championing Fair Housing and Realtor Ethics for decades; helping establish HGAR as one of the first organizations in the U.S. to embrace Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion and hiring its first full-time DEI Officer and helping lead HGAR through the most difficult period in its history—the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Since he announced back in September that he would be leaving HGAR to take over as CEO of OneKey MLS on Jan. 1, 2023, from retiring CEO Jim Speer, well-wishes have been pouring in from new and longtime HGAR, NYSAR and NAR members.</p>
<div id="attachment_43125" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43125" class="wp-image-43125" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1398762_534142080007353_2124806070_o.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-43125" class="wp-caption-text">From left, Richard Haggerty bestowing Albert P.<br /> Schatz with the first Legislative Advocacy Award that<br /> has since been awarded each year in Schatz name.</p></div>
<p>2022 HGAR President Anthony Domathoti seemed to sum up the feelings of many association members when he said recently, “A leader like Richard doesn’t come around every day. His ability to make every team member feel valued is an irreplaceable quality. He is one of the pillars that held HGAR up. I’m fortunate to have been able to work with him, and I wish him all the very best in the future. I thank him for everything…He will be missed.”</p>
<p>The veteran Realtor executive first worked at the then Westchester County Board of Realtors in 1984 as a temporary employee. After three weeks he was offered a job as the Director of Membership Administration and over the years he worked in other departments including Professional Standards and Multiple Listing Service. He was appointed Deputy Executive Officer in 2004.</p>
<p>After the Westchester County Board of Realtors merger with the Putnam County Association of Realtors in 2009 that created the Westchester/Putnam Association of Realtors, he oversaw WPAR’s merger with the Rockland County Board of Realtors and the Orange County Association of Realtors that created the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors in 2012. In January 2017, HGAR merged with the Manhattan Association of Realtors, creating an HGAR Manhattan Chapter, and in 2020 HGAR merged with the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors to create the Bronx Chapter of HGAR.</p>
<p>Since OneKey MLS’s inception in 2018, Haggerty has served as OneKey MLS’s President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer. Along with Speer, Haggerty was instrumental in the creation of OneKey MLS, the New York metro area’s first regional multiple listing service. Launched with the Long Island Board of Realtors, OneKey MLS has more than 50,000 subscribers and serves Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Orange, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p>
<p>Since Haggerty penned his last “<a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/viewpoints/gateway-perspectives-final-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gateway Perspectives</a>” column in this edition of the newspaper, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> thought now was the time to get his perspectives on the association’s past, present and future, as well as his goals at OneKey MLS.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In your 38 years at the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and predecessor organizations, you have filled a variety of roles and provided a wide range of services to the membership including ethics training and most recently championing the association’s groundbreaking Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. With that in mind, how has the role of the Realtor changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>Haggerty:</strong> When I first came to work for the association, which was in 1984, we were getting the (listing) books that were delivered from Canada and we would deliver a hot sheet that had all the status changes in all of the existing inventory every day to all of the offices. Back then, the Realtor was the caretaker of the information and in order to have access to information, you had to work with a Realtor. That started to change with the advent of computerized MLSs. When I first went to work for the association, we had the very first beginning of a computerized MLS. They were hard-coded monitors that were plugged into a system that was very primitive, but still back then it was pretty cutting-edge.</p>
<p>But, if there is one thing that has definitely changed is that Realtors are no longer the gatekeepers of the information. They have really evolved into much more service-oriented professionals where their focus is on providing a high level of professional service. … It took a long time, but I think that is the biggest transition for Realtors in my tenure.</p>
<div id="attachment_43126" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43126" class="wp-image-43126" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/66021266_10217871673815419_7603502959137128448_n-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="313" /><p id="caption-attachment-43126" class="wp-caption-text">An old WCBR staff photo from the archives of Real Estate In-Depth.</p></div>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> How has the role of the Realtor association changed in your nearly four decades at HGAR and is its work more relevant now and if so, why?</p>
<p><strong>Haggerty:</strong> I think the biggest change is we deliver information in a much more-timely basis. When you think about it in 1984, we relied strictly on deliveries. We delivered the books; we delivered the hot sheets and mail. At that point, Al Gore had not invented the Internet yet. It was a really different environment. So, when news broke, we would report it in the monthly newspaper (<em>Westchester Realtor</em>). It wasn’t as though we had a website we could splash it all over.</p>
<p>Fast-forward with what we did with COVID, where we were providing almost real-time information to our members. Members expect information in numerous different formats, whether it be the website (HGAR or <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>), e-mails, texts, weekly newsletters (the monthly newspaper <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>) and the Daily Update. However, they want the information. We have to be able to deliver it and it’s got to be immediate and it’s got to be so much more-timely. I think the members got used to The Daily Update (launched in the early stages of the COVID pandemic in April 2020) and getting their news on a much more-timely basis. And that has been a big evolution. I think we have been able to really step up our game and fill that niche very effectively, and in my perspective, much more effectively than many other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In your early days as CEO, you began talks that eventually led to mergers that significantly increased membership rolls and the association’s service area to Orange, Rockland, the Bronx and Manhattan. What were the economic and business forces that drove you to make these deals?</p>
<p><strong>Haggerty:</strong> I think the biggest force was that the market became more regional. When I first came to work at the Westchester County Board of Realtors, we had maybe right around 1,500 members, maybe a little less. At the time, everyone operated in the towns where their offices were located. So, if you were in Larchmont, that is where you sold. Over the years, that started to change and it really started to change because MLSs became more organized, real estate data became more complete and Realtors had more access to data. As they had access to more data and accurate data, they started to expand their market areas. And also, there was a push by two different forces toward regionalization of offices. One was when Jack Mitchell convinced George Lawrence to merge with Art Houlihan and create Houlihan Lawrence. So, all of a sudden you had an office that covered the southern part of the county based in Bronxville and you had an office covering the Northern part of Westchester, join forces to cover the entire county. And Dan Bixler did something very similar when he got a Coldwell Banker franchise and started opening offices throughout the county and beyond. And that’s what happened with Houlihan, which expanded into Putnam and expanded even further. And when those forces really started to expand outside of the county, obviously we started to look at whether we should be expanding our borders.</p>
<p>We started with Putnam in 2009 and then we were approached by Rockland County through Drew Kessler at the time who was interested if we wanted to talk about a potential merger. And I made the decision with (WCBR CEO) Gil (Mercurio) at the time that if we are talking merger with Rockland, we should also talk merger with Orange County. … I reached out to (OCAR CEO) Ann Garti and asked if this should be a three-way conversation and she said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>The same thing happened in Manhattan where we saw the opportunity to expand into Manhattan. That organization was reaching out to several organizations, and they decided that we were the best fit. When you look at the fact that Westchester is, from my perspective, an extremely important suburb of New York City and Manhattan, that seemed to make a natural progression as well. So, I think we are responding to natural market forces where the region was expanding and continues to expand. <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Haggerty also discussed the circumstances surrounding the merger with the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors in 2020 and noted that COVID sped up the process that resulted in the ratification of the merger deal via General Membership meetings held on Zoom.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> You are leaving HGAR as the industry heads into uncertain times with the Federal Reserve trying to tamp down growth without bringing on a recession by hiking interest rates. How do you see the regional housing market in 2023 and what are the key issues that will determine the health of the market?</p>
<p><strong>Haggerty:</strong> I am still bullish on this market and primarily because of geography. I do think the Federal Reserve is playing a very interesting game of chicken. I think he (Fed Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell) talks a tough game because he doesn’t want the markets to go out of control. So, when they did the half-percentage point increase (earlier this month), I think everybody anticipated that. But, then he was very hawkish in his remarks afterwards saying they were going to continue to raise rates. I think he uses that hawkish rhetoric as a tool to try to curb as Alan Greenspan used to call it “irrational exuberance.” I do think, quite frankly, that they will potentially slow down the rate hikes if the market indicators continue to show that inflation is being tamed.</p>
<div id="attachment_43127" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43127" class="wp-image-43127" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JVP_0153-copy.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p id="caption-attachment-43127" class="wp-caption-text">Longtime friends, former HGAR COO Ann Garti<br /> and HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty</p></div>
<p>At the end of the day, in this area the local economy is very strong. I really think that because of our lack of inventory, we are going to see a softening in 2023 of sales, but I don’t see a softening in prices. I just think that because of our low inventory situation, with no relief in sight, that prices are going to stay steady. My biggest concern for this area, and the rest of the nation as a whole, I see a lot of new construction of multifamily housing and not a lot of construction of single-family homes and condos and I don’t want this country to be a nation of renters. … I really think both on the state and local levels, we have to really come up with ways to continue to promote homeownership as a way to create generational wealth… <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> He said that the Hudson Valley is recognizing the need to develop affordable housing and praised Westchester County Executive George Latimer for earmarking a record $90 million in 2023 for affordable housing initiatives. He said the issue must be addressed via public-private partnerships for true progress to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Can you spell out your goals as you take on your new position as CEO of OneKey MLS?</p>
<p><strong>Haggerty:</strong> So, I would put it into two different buckets. The first is to really increase the efficiencies and the tools connected to the MLS. To really give the best tools available to our subscribers and participants so they will be able to deliver the best service that is possible to their consumers. The second is growth. I remember why we created OneKey MLS to begin with, which was to create one MLS and one consumer-facing site that benefits the entire greater New York City and suburban geography and that is where buses and trains go in and out of the city. I think there should be one MLS and that is not going to happen overnight, but I think it could definitely happen in the near future and I think it needs to happen. As I indicated earlier, a lot of firms have really become regional forces. You look at firms that used to be based only in the city that have now expanded into the suburbs, out to Long Island and up into the Hudson Valley, and out into Connecticut and even into New Jersey. And it doesn’t make sense that they have to be members of multiple MLSs.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean there is just going to be one MLS. There may be partnerships. There may be other opportunities to cooperate, but we have to figure out ways of delivering the most efficient service that we can to our participants and subscribers because when you look at the natural growth of this area, it just makes sense.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Real estate investment and housing make up a very important and critical component of the U.S. economy. Housing averages roughly 15% to 18% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) explains that the contribution of real estate and related services to GDP occurs in two ways: (1) “Residential investment (averaging roughly 3-5% of GDP), which includes construction of new single-family and multifamily structures, residential remodeling, production of manufactured homes, and brokers’ fees” and (2) “Consumption spending on housing services (averaging roughly 12%-13% of GDP), which includes gross rents and utilities paid by renters, as well as owners’ imputed rents and utility payments.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZjOrqa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ZjOrqa</a>].</p>
<p>Real estate, in one way or another, affects almost every aspect of an individual’s daily life. In 2023, it will be important to track developments in the real estate industry as they relate to increased Federal Reserve interest and mortgage rates, inflation, availability of housing supplies, and legislative initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>The Negative Impacts of Inflation </strong><strong>And Higher Interest Rates </strong></p>
<p>As of November, 2022, the inflation rate came in at 7.1% and while the short-term trend seems to be falling, the Federal Reserve is still raising the overnight borrowing rates to combat decades-high inflation. On Dec. 14<sup>, </sup>2022, the Federal Reserve Board raised rates by a half point, increasing the targeted range to 4.25% to 4.50%, which is the highest level in 15 years. As one would imagine, the real estate market significantly slowed in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>In January, 2022, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.22%. On November 10<sup>, </sup>2022, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit an intra-year high of 7.08%. For example, payments on a $500,000 30-year fixed mortgage went from $2,167.81 to $3,353.42 per month. Annual interest paid increased from $26,013.72 to $40,241.04. During the week of Jan. 5, 2023, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was approximately 6.48%. While, historically, interest rates in the 6.00% range are still relatively low, psychologically, younger prospective purchasers of real estate have not seen rates at this level in their lifetimes. As a result, they have decided to wait, hoping interest rates will fall back to pre-2022 levels. Unfortunately, this will likely not occur in 2023. However, if rates do stabilize, the real estate market may see a modest increase in sales, with prices stabilizing or falling a bit.</p>
<p>The cost of rents and utilities have also increased dramatically over the past few years. One main reason for the rise in rent is that the supply of rental housing and residential real estate available for purchase are at historical lows. According to the National Association of Realtors, “Home prices continue to rise to record highs, eroding affordability. Since 2019, home prices rose nearly 30%. As a result, a typical home is about $80,000 more expensive than pre-pandemic. Meanwhile, inventory of homes for sale dropped significantly in the last couple of years, reaching record lows in 2021. In fact, there was a housing shortage even before the pandemic hit in 2020.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3GxJvpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3GxJvpo</a>].</p>
<p>Many purchasers have elected to rent rather than purchase for the time being, also driving up rental rates. According to a recent Harris Poll, as reported by <em>Inman</em> [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3QsseT6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3QsseT6</a>], 71% of Americans are hesitant to move forward with the purchase of a home due to the “uncertainty about economic conditions including inflation and the prospects of a recession.” Additionally, <em>Inman</em> points out that 61% of individuals “felt priced out of the market.”</p>
<p>Historically, owning real estate rather than renting was the preferred goal, so that an individual could build wealth and equity. In recent years, the focus has shifted to renting, in part due to the increased cost of real estate and, in part due to the limited purchase supply. However, renters should be aware that they are not afforded the ability to deduct annual expenses (i.e., interest, real estate taxes, etc.). In 2023, there should be a shift in focus back to home ownership.</p>
<p><strong>The State of ‘Good Cause Eviction’ in New York</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few years, several municipalities, including Albany, Poughkeepsie, Beacon and Hudson, to name a few, have passed local legislation requiring landlords to establish “good cause” before being able to evict a tenant. In July, 2022, a Supreme Court decision in Albany County invalidated Local Law F [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3Rt4yOa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Rt4yOa</a>] in <em>Pusatere v. City of Albany</em>. The decision was the subject of an article in this column [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3ItromZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ItromZ</a>]. The decision of the Supreme Court was ultimately appealed by the City of Albany and the New York State Association of Realtors (NYSAR) filed an Amicus Curiae brief in support of the plaintiffs in Pusatere.</p>
<p>While we await the decision of the Appellate Division in the appeal, ultimately it will provide some clarity as to the ultimate fate of “good cause” eviction legislation. The Appellate Division’s decision will affect whether other local laws will be invalidated and may have an impact as to whether the State Legislature will attempt to enact “good cause” legislation at the state level [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3XeFj4l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3XeFj4l</a>]. It will be important for the real estate industry to keep a close eye on the outcome of this appeal in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Pending Legislative Initiatives</strong></p>
<p>NYSAR has also prepared a detailed report on a variety of legislation that has been introduced over the past few years which need to be carefully followed by those in the real estate industry. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3Iy4M4A">https://bit.ly/3Iy4M4A</a>]. While some of the legislation is clearly positive and welcome, some will have a negative impact on the real estate market in New York.</p>
<p><strong>Co-op Transparency Legislation</strong></p>
<p>One important piece of legislation that has been introduced at the state level, but has not yet passed is Senate Bill S2846 <strong>[See </strong><a href="https://bit.ly/3iqT2X9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3iqT2X9</a><strong>] </strong>which would ensure fairness and transparency in the cooperative housing purchase process. This legislation would establish a finite timeline for a cooperative corporation board to respond to applicants and would also require a reason for any denial of an application in order to help combat illegal discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Legislation: </strong><strong>The All-Electric Building Act &amp; </strong><strong>The Climate and Community Investment Act</strong></p>
<p>The All-Electric Building Act would prohibit the use of gas or oil in all new residential, commercial, and mixed-use construction statewide by Dec. 31, 2023. Senate Bill S6843C [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3X2tSxe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3X2tSxe</a>] provides “that the state energy conservation construction code shall prohibit infrastructure, building systems, or equipment used for the combustion of fossil fuels in new construction statewide no later than Dec. 31, 2023, if the building is less than seven stories and July 1, 2027, if the building is seven stories or more.” The costs to implement these changes will be considerable and will certainly affect the ability of real estate owners to comply with the requirements of this legislation.</p>
<p>The Climate and Community Investment Act [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3GOpiN3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3GOpiN3</a>] makes a priority “the allocation of public investments in disadvantaged communities; addresses climate change challenges through the expansion and growth of clean and renewable energy sources; adopts best value requirements for the solicitation, evaluation and award of renewable energy projects; establishes a community just transition program; establishes a climate pollution fee and a household and small business energy rebate; creates the climate and community investment authority.” The legislation would impose new carbon emissions taxes and additional fees on homeowners and consumers.</p>
<p>While many believe that reduction of greenhouse gases and pollution is a laudable goal, passing such legislation and implementing onerous requirements without addressing the possibility of feasible alternatives, introducing longer and more reasonable transition goals, substantial costs relating to same, and most importantly, whether or not the state’s electrical grid would be able to support the transition to renewable forms of energy without the necessary upgrades, is not acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Legislation Imposing Additional Real Estate Transfer Taxes</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are also various bills that seek to increase transfer taxes in connection with the sale of real property, such as Senate Bill S4199 [See </strong><a href="https://bit.ly/3vOGxaW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3vOGxaW</a><strong>] (which </strong>would impose a Pied-a-Terre Tax), <strong>Senate Bill S5376 [<u>see</u> </strong><a href="https://bit.ly/3Gl1hfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Gl1hfg</a><strong>] </strong><strong>(which </strong>would impose an additional real estate transfer tax on properties in New York City that are sold within two years of their prior purchase and a tax on the transfer of certain properties in NYC sold for $1 million or more), and <strong>Senate Bill S1461 [<u>see</u> </strong><a href="https://bit.ly/3GMNcJ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3GMNcJ4</a><strong>] </strong><strong>(which </strong>would authorize cities or towns to impose additional real estate transfer taxes on sellers and would authorize municipalities to create community preservation funds to preserve open space).</p>
<p>Consumers and real estate professionals alike should be aware of these aforementioned legislative initiatives, as well as others, and should make a concerted effort to contact your local representatives to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>While 2022 may have brought its fair share of challenges, it is exciting to know that 2023 will be an exciting new year that will bring its fair share of opportunities. Keeping up with all market and legislative developments will provide everyone with key opportunities to advance economically, socially and personally.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Yep, it’s that time of year again. The 2022 year has ended and Realtors can go to OneKey MLS and see the final 2022 real estate activity statistics. It’s also at this time of year that, inevitably, Realtors come out of the woodwork with all sorts of marketing to say, “I’m #1!” Sadly, for me, it’s during this time of the year when I’m inundated with calls and e-mails from Realtors saying so-and-so can’t be number one; I’m number one. Agents get really mad. Complaints are filed. It can get pretty ugly.</p>
<p>So, this article is going to highlight the how-to of researching, marketing, and reviewing your (and other Realtors) statistics to ensure that you are doing it clearly and correctly so you can avoid any problems. This will be short and sweet.</p>
<p>Here are the significant rules that are implicated:</p>
<p><strong>Code of Ethics Article 12:</strong> Article 12 states that “Realtors shall be honest and truthful in their real estate communications and shall present a true picture in their advertising, marketing, and other representations….”</p>
<p><strong>OneKey Rules and Procedures #608:</strong> “…any print or non-print forms of advertising or other form of public representations based in whole or in part on information supplied by the association or its MLS must clearly demonstrate the period of time over which such claims are based and must include the following, or substantially similar, notice: ‘Based upon information from OneKey MLS, for the period (<em>date</em>) through (<em>date</em>).’”</p>
<p><strong>NY Real Property Law:</strong> In general, NY Real Property Law, which governs the actions and licensing of real estate professionals requires that licensees show competence and trustworthiness in their activities. Failure to do so can result in their real estate license being revoked. More specifically, RPL section 441-c(1)(a) states that a real estate license may be revoked for “dishonest or misleading advertising, or [the licensee] has demonstrated untrustworthiness or incompetency to act as a real estate broker or salesman, as the case may be.”</p>
<p><strong>Compliance With These Rules/Laws</strong></p>
<p>So, what should a Realtor do to avoid being found in violation of the above rules, particularly when they want to market themselves as being the top in a specific area? In short, do your homework to ensure that your categories are accurate. In conducting your ranking report searches, you are free to state that you are number one in any category which is accurate. An agent is free to fine tune any category to fit their needs, whether it’s done by streamlining under “status,” “property type,” “price range,” “county,” “city/town,” “post office,” “village,” “school district,” “home style,” or “zip code,” etc. You are free to refine your search by the date range, as well as by the various volume or transaction types (i.e., total transactions, total volume, list side transactions, list side volume, sale side transactions and sale side volume). So long as you are, for example, number one based upon OneKey MLS from the period of Jan. 1, 2021 – Dec. 31, 2021, in total sale side transactions, single-family homes, priced between $600,000 – $700,000, in Nyack, NY, you are free to say that, even though there may be just one transaction; thus making you number one. However, make sure that you put that little asterisk next to your claim and add special, detailed language that indicates your source and criteria.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you make a claim of #1 in a broad region, make sure that you are correct and use specific language for your claim. You might consider double-checking your results by using various search criteria. For example, run your search by town name, and then by zip code, and then by village or school district or post office. Surprisingly, sometimes the results may differ. Make sure that you’re solidly number one. If you’re not, you can rest assured that another Realtor is conducting the exact same search and will be reaching out to you, your manager, or me, or the DOS to complain. They may even contact New York State. There are, in fact, numerous cases where agents have lost their licenses over such claims, as this might be deemed a fraud on the public; a very serious matter in the eyes of the Department of State. This warning goes for all brokers too, as you have a duty to supervise all agents under your license.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Teams</strong></p>
<p>Currently, OneKey MLS does not have a category for teams and teams are not recognized by New York State. If you are aggregating all transactions under a team leader, that can be dangerous, so be very careful. Ensure that any team members transactions are accrued while a part of the team, as team members do not always join on January 1st and leave on December 31st. Further, NYSAR has indicated that a broker can assign MLS points to whomever they deem responsible for earning those points, similar to the way they would assign MLS points to someone seeking to obtain their broker’s license. However, the gray area is when a team leader does not touch a file/transaction, but is awarded all the MLS points. Once those points are counted up, it could amount to a substantial number and surpass many individual agents. Therefore, as a team leader, be wary of “earning” MLS points from a transaction that you did not touch. Additionally, if you are claiming to be number one based upon accumulated statistics from a team, I would advise you to identify yourself as the team and not as an individual. Otherwise, you can almost assuredly guarantee that someone will complain.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It’s great to be #1. Shout it from the rooftops if you want. But to avoid complaints, make sure that your statistics and criteria are clear. Double-check your numbers. If you’re wrong, you could be facing a lot of headaches and lost time in the new year. Also, you might even consider making that fine print a little large, just so others (and the public) can read it clearly.</p>
<p>If you’re #1 in 2022, congratulations. Interesting story: I heard that Bilbo Baggins became a Realtor and he was #1 in total volume between the prices of 250,000 and 300,000 Mithrils, for single-family hobbit holes, in the Shire, Hamlet of Hobbiton, Kingdom of Middle-Earth for quite some time.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> If the aforementioned Bilbo Baggins data is confusing to some, please consult a friend or colleague who is a “Lord of the Rings” fan.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—In her 2023 State of the State address on Jan. 10 in Albany, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul outlined key initiatives to reduce crime and gun violence, enhance mental health services and address the affordability crisis in the state.</p>
<p>The governor introduced her “New York Housing Compact,” a groundbreaking strategy to catalyze housing development that has a goal of creating 800,000 new units in the next decade. She said the state will provide assistance to localities to meet the housing goal by offering “substantial new funding for infrastructure like schools, roads, and sewers needed to support growing communities.”</p>
<p>Every single locality across the state will have a target for building new homes, she noted. Upstate, the target is for the current housing stock to grow by 1% every three years. Downstate, 3% every three years. She added that as part of the compact, any municipality with a train station should rezone the area within a half-mile of the station, to allow for the creation of new housing within the next three years. Gov. Hochul also promised a replacement for the 421a tax exemption in New York City.</p>
<p>Many business and political leaders praised the governor’s housing initiative.</p>
<p>The Welcome Home Westchester alliance, which is advocating for more affordable housing development in Westchester County, released a statement in support of the governor’s New York Housing Compact. The group, which includes members such as The Building and Realty Institute, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the Westchester County Association, stated, &#8220;Governor Hochul put forth a bold vision for tackling our housing shortage in our region. It acknowledges a truth at the heart of our housing affordability crisis—that every community in the Greater New York City area plays a role in creating this housing shortfall, and so every community needs to do what it can to be a part of the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group noted that the recently completed Westchester County Housing Needs Assessment found the the county needs to build 11,703 new units of housing just to see the present-day need. &#8220;A gap that large doesn&#8217;t happen by accident. Over the previous decades, the fragmented municipality by-municipality land use system we built made it too easy to create barriers to housing, create delays for approvals, pass the buck to other neighborhoods or other towns when it came to housing affordability, or fail to update local zoning codes such that we are often trying to squeeze our 21st Century needs into a tool designed for a mid-20th century lifestyle.  It has been simply too easy for too long to avoid building the housing we need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welcome Home Westchester later noted that while further details and fine tuning on her plan are expected, it believes the &#8220;basic approach would make a measurable difference towards making it easier to build the housing communities we need.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors also praised the governor&#8217;s housing compact. &#8220;We support the Governor&#8217;s New York State Housing Compact, including incentives to re-purpose commercial space and hotels for residential housing and increased state support for the creation of 800,000 new homes over the next decade, all of which builds on last year&#8217;s $25-billion investment to create and preserve 100,000 affordable homes over the next five years,&#8221; NYSAR stated. &#8220;also key to successfully moving forward is a commitment by New York State and its local governments to improve the regulatory climate that currently does not promote housing development. We encourage all lawmakers and regulators to rethink local building code and zoning rules that have been a root cause of the current housing shortage.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, because New York State is a &#8220;home-rule state,&#8221; opposition to imposing edicts to local municipalities will likely get some push-back from some local officials.</p>
<p>For example, Rockland County Executive Ed Day said, &#8220;I am concerned as well about some of the mandates included in the governor&#8217;s new NY Housing Compact that will require municipalities to change zoning in specific areas of their communities and meet mandatory home growth targets. As your County Executive, and past president of a local civic association, I believe this concept to be contradicted by the Constitution of New York State and will continue to stand firmly in opposition to any politically-based plan that undermines New York State Home Rule regulations and municipal zoning ordinances.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is also concerned about possible legislation that would allow, promote and possibly reward homeowners for building out Accessory Dwelling Units.</p>
<p>&#8220;While creating affordable housing is an admirable goal, our own Planning Department stated in their professional assessment the one-size fits&#8217;ll approach of the ADU legislation is extremely problematic and does not account for differences between rural, suburban, and urban communities and I&#8217;m concerned there is a strong likelihood that the character of our county could be changed forever,&#8221; Rockland County Day stated.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Governor&#8217;s &#8216;New York Housing Compact&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Under the compact, localities will decide how to best meet their new home construction targets. From repurposing underutilized office parks and strip malls to offering new incentives towards multifamily buildings, localities can choose how to tailor their strategies to increase housing supply. To encourage the inclusion of affordable housing as part of the new growth, affordable units will be assigned extra weight in calculating localities’ progress toward their goals.</p>
<p>Localities that do not meet targets can achieve Safe Harbor status for one three-year cycle by implementing certain good faith actions—or “Preferred Actions”—that create zoning capacity to achieve the growth targets. In municipalities where there is no market demand for new housing there will be no practical effect if localities fall short of their targets.</p>
<p>The New York Housing Compact will make available a $250-million Infrastructure Fund and a $20-million Planning Fund to support new housing production statewide. Municipalities may submit requests for planning funding to undertake either required Transit-Oriented Development rezonings or Preferred Actions to help them hit their growth targets. The plan will also create a new Housing Planning Office within New York State Homes and Community Renewal to provide municipalities with support and guidance.</p>
<p>The New York Housing Compact will require that localities with rail stations run by the MTA undertake a local rezoning or higher density multifamily development within half a mile of the station unless they already meet the density level. By expanding housing potential in these transit-oriented communities, more families will be able to enjoy improved access to jobs and thriving sustainable communities, state officials said.</p>
<p>After three years, in localities that do not meet growth targets or do not take steps to implement Preferred Actions, proposed housing developments that meet particular affordability criteria, but may not conform to existing zoning, may take advantage of a fast-track housing approval process if the locality denies the permit. The appeal can be made to a new State Housing Approval Board or through the courts. Appealed projects will be approved unless a locality can demonstrate a valid health or safety reason for denying the application.</p>
<p>To expedite rezoning and development of new homes, specific relief from environmental review will be included in the New Homes Targets and Transit Oriented Development proposals. The state will continue to exercise crucial safeguards that prevent environmental harm and ensure that public health remains a top priority.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul unveiled a series of new proposals to incentivize new housing construction and the rehabilitation of existing housing. This includes new property tax exemptions to encourage mixed income housing development near train stations and incentivize affordable housing in commercial buildings that are converted to residential use in New York City. This also includes updated property tax exemptions offered by local option to support homeowners that build Accessory Dwelling Units and for property owners who need support undertaking certain renovations in New York City.</p>
<p>To support the development of mixed-income housing outside of New York City, Gov. Hochul will direct New York State Homes and Community Renewal to make $5 million in State Low Income Housing Tax Credits available.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul will also make necessary changes to ensure that localities where new housing developments utilize Payment in Lieu of Taxes agreements are not penalized in tax cap calculations.</p>
<p>The governor will work with the State Legislature to develop a successor for the 421-a property tax exemption program that expired last year to stimulate production of new rental housing in New York City.</p>
<p>The governor announced additional proposals to increase the state’s supply of safe, stable, comfortable housing for all New Yorkers.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul will propose legislation to create a program that builds on proven models to drastically reduce lead exposure risk in rental housing outside of New York City, targeting areas classified as “high-risk” for lead exposure based on incidence of childhood elevated blood lead levels. This will require multi-family rental units in such areas that were built prior to 1980 to undergo a lead risk assessment every three years—if lead hazards are found, the landlord will be required to remediate the housing unit. There will be grant funding for eligible landlords to help cover the cost of these assessments and the remediation of identified hazards.</p>
<p>The governor will also propose legislation that will update the existing law that enables local governments to take ownership of certain dangerous abandoned properties. This legislation will help localities reduce public health risks, improve property values for neighboring homeowners, increase property tax revenues and create new housing opportunities.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[In 2022, high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s actions of hiking interest rates to tamp down the inflation rate that reached a peak of 9.1% in June have taken their toll on buyer demand.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The residential sales market in the Hudson Valley and New York City continues to transition from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced frenzied period where buyers flocked to take advantage of historically low interest rates. In 2022, high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s actions of hiking interest rates to tamp down the inflation rate that reached a peak of 9.1% in June have taken their toll on buyer demand.</p>
<p>The latest figures supplied by OneKey MLS on the six-county market area of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors paints a clear picture of a sales slowdown as each county posted double digit declines in the fourth quarter and year-to-year overall sales, with one exception—The Bronx, which posted a 3.3% overall year-to-year sales decrease in 2022 as compared to 2021.</p>
<p>HGAR officials and area Realtors agree that while sales volume declined in 2022, in fact, sales activity was higher than transactions posted pre-pandemic in 2019. While all expect a market that will continue to adapt to higher interest rates, as one veteran Realtor cautioned, “The sky is not falling.”</p>
<p>Total residential sales in the counties to the north of New York City decreased year-over-year with The Bronx County leading the HGAR market area with a decrease of only -3.3% (2,485 units compared to 2,571 in 2021). More significant year-over-year decreases included Westchester County with a decrease of -12.6% (10,367 units compared to 11,866 in 2021); Sullivan County with a decrease of -15% (1,188 units compared to 1,398 in 2021); Orange County with a decrease of -15.9% (4,554 units compared to 5,417 in 2021); Rockland County with a decrease of -19.9% (2,919 units compared to 3,644 in 2021); and Putnam County with a decline of -20.5% (1,277 units compared to 1,607 in 2021).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-43410 size-full" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Q4-HGAR-Market-Area-Overall-Home-Sales.png?_t=1674066928" alt="" width="383" height="337" />Sales of single-family residential units year-over-year decreased across the board. The median price of a single-family residence rose in every county, with the largest being a 13.8% increase in Rockland County to $637,000 from $560,000 in 2021, yet Rockland County’s single-family home sales decreased by -21.2% for the year to 2,121 units (compared to 2,693 in 2021). Notably, Westchester County, with the highest prices in the region, had the smallest percentage increase in the median single-family home price for the year at 4.5% ($815,000 as compared to $780,000 in 2021).</p>
<p>Putnam County saw its single-family median price rise 11.3% to $489,500 (from $440,000 in 2021), yet Putnam County had the largest percentage decrease (-21.9%) in single-family home sales year-over-year (1,074 units vs. 1,375 in 2021). Orange County saw a 9% increase in its single-family median price to $400,000 (from $367,000 in 2021), but saw a -15.6% decrease in sales (3,754 units vs. 4,450 in 2021). <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022-4th-Quarter-YTD-Report-FINAL.pdf">Read the full HGAR Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date 2022 Sales Report</a></p>
<p>Entering 2022, while many housing economists and analysts believe sales activity will continue to fall, at least for the short-term, there are some hopeful signs that perhaps the factors that have contributed to the downturn in the market are showing signs of improvement.</p>
<p>For example, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun had some favorable comments after the most recent Consumer Price Index figures for December were released recently, showing the inflation rate had fallen once again. Yun said, “Inflation has been coming down. Mortgage rates will also, therefore, come down. The latest Consumer Price Index of 6.45% in December is in the sixth consecutive month of deceleration after peak inflation of 9.1% in June 2022. Housing inflation due to rising rents is the one major item still showing acceleration but is soon expected to come down as well. Rents increased by 8.35% in December, its highest reading in more than 40 years. Private sector data in recent months have been pointing to near-zero rent growth in some major cities, and robust apartment construction will raise rental vacancy rates.”</p>
<p>He later stated, “The 30-year mortgage rate dropping under 6% is now a distinct possibility. The gate is beginning to open for homebuyers who got shut out in October and November when the rates went above 7%. However, there is still a housing shortage and not enough listings.”</p>
<p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that he believes 2023 will be a year of continued change for the residential real estate market. “I don’t think it will be transformational in a bad way,” he said, noting that buyer demand continues to be influenced by higher interest rates, low inventory and high home values.</p>
<p>“I think we are transforming back into what I hope will be reality because interest rates for about a decade have been at historic lows,” he said. “And I don’t think that reflects a strong and healthy market.”</p>
<p>D’Anzica, who is being installed as 2023 HGAR President on Feb. 2 at an event to be held at the Marina del Rey in the Bronx, added that the low interest rates were the result of “The Great Depression” that took place in 2008 and 2009 and were kept in place to keep the economy afloat at the time.” He added that he does not expect lending rates to be that low for some time, unless some major event warrants the Federal Reserve to bolster a struggling economy.</p>
<p>He said that for the past 30 to 40 years, mortgage rates have probably averaged between 7% and 8%, which he noted were more reflective of a normal market. He said that some Realtors were probably not in the business back in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 when rates were higher and therefore have no frame of reference of what a healthy market was in years gone by.</p>
<p>“We should embrace a normal, stable, healthy interest rate,” said D’Anzica, who is the Broker-Owner of Dynamax Realty NYC in New York City. He said Realtors need to educate buyers and sellers on the realities of the changing market and that he expects sales will moderate, as will the pace of home value increases in the region.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, D’Anzica expects the structural changes to continue in the real estate market and over the long term as rates stabilize at their current level and prices of some homes will become more affordable. “In 2023, we will see more moderate sales. There might be growth, but much more moderate,” he predicted.</p>
<p>He said there are a number of potential headwinds that could impact the real estate market in 2023, including the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Veteran Realtor Leah Caro, who is president of Park Sterling Realty in Bronxville, appearing on the Building and Realty Institute’s “Building Knowledge” radio program on WVOX on Friday, Jan. 13, told listeners that sales in single-family homes, condominiums and cooperatives were significantly higher in 2022 as compared to the pre-pandemic period in 2019. However, listings are significantly down year-over-year in comparison to 2021.</p>
<p>“The sky is not falling,” Caro said, “despite what you may be seeing on the news about the economy and real estate, it is actually not in bad shape.” She said market conditions going into 2023 are in fact better in many cases than 2019, which at the time was considered a healthy market. Caro added that in 2023 the market “seems to be heading back into some normalcy.”</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence in its recent market report for the region also pointed to some market shifts that may be signaling a more normalized market. “As we enter 2023, conditions remain ideal for sellers who properly price their homes, as discouraged yet price-savvy buyers continue to wait for new inventory,” said Liz Nunan, President and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence. “Our communities across Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties continue to attract new residents looking to establish new roots and inspire existing residents to move within our towns.”</p>
<p>In the brokerage firm’s luxury market report, Anthony P. Cutugno, Sr. Vice President, Private Brokerage of Houlihan Lawrence, said that pressure from employers to return to the office, lay-offs at technology companies, and smaller Wall Street bonuses may temper the luxury housing market in 2023.</p>
<p>“The market is admittedly complicated. The first half of 2023 will likely see a decline in sales north of New York City, though even a sharp drop does not mean the market is collapsing,” said Cutugno. He explained that the past two years of luxury sales in Westchester are about equal to the aggregate homes sold in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. “Perhaps 2023 will recalibrate our expectations of a healthy real estate market as the shadow of the pandemic recedes.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Although the population continues to increase, fewer Americans decided to move in 2022. After a historically low moving rate in 2021, data indicates that even fewer Americans moved across the country last year. However, this is not a new trend. Millions of people moved during the pandemic, driven by the opportunity to work remotely, the desire for more space, and better affordability.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the moving rate has declined for the last six years. While the Census Bureau hasn’t yet released the moving rate for 2022, another source of migration data—the United States Postal Service change-of-address data—demonstrates a persistent declining migration trend for 2022 as well. Nearly 70% of the ZIP codes across the United States experienced fewer inbound moves in 2022 compared to 2021.</p>
<p><strong>2022 Domestic Net Migration by State</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau recently released the net domestic migration—the number of people moving in and out of an area—for each state in 2022. Twenty-six states experienced an influx of people, with more people moving in than out, while 25 states lost movers. Florida (318,855), Texas (230,961), and the Carolinas—North Carolina (99,796) and South Carolina (84,030)—were the states with the most net domestic migration gains in 2022. Positive net domestic migration and positive net international migration significantly boosted population growth in these areas. Florida was the fastest-growing state in 2022, with an annual population increase of 1.9% within a year. In fact, that was the first time since 1957 that Florida’s population grew faster than anywhere else across the United States. With most of these fast-growing areas located in the South, this region continues to be the most populous region, with nearly 130 million residents.</p>
<p>However, California (-343,230), New York (-299,557), and Illinois (-141,656) experienced the largest net domestic outmigration. As a result, the population dropped even further in these states. Despite this decrease, California remained the most populous state, with nearly 39 million residents statewide.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-43518" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/States-sorted-by-Domestic-Net-Migration.png" alt="" width="400" height="1300" />2022 Domestic Net Migration by Metro Area</strong></p>
<p>Looking at the local level, remember that while the Census doesn’t yet provide any information for 2022, the current study uses the USPS change-of-address data to identify the local migration trends. Since people who want to forward their mail from their old homes to their new residences file a change of address request to the USPS, this dataset is a good proxy for how and where many people are moving. The current analysis covers relocations by ZIP code across the United States during 2022.</p>
<p>Most areas that experienced the largest influx of people were in Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas. Ocala, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Charlotte, NC; Savannah, GA; Houston, TX; Deltona, FL and Myrtle Beach, SC were some large areas1 where inbound exceeded outbound moves by more than six percentage points. For example, the inbound move rate was nearly 57% on average in the Charlotte metro area.</p>
<p>A common characteristic of these populous areas, in addition to the fact that they are located in the Sun Belt region, was a robust job market recovery after the pandemic. Among the top 10 large areas with the highest inbound move rates, not only was their economy able to recover all the jobs that were lost at the beginning of the pandemic, but there are about 5% on average more jobs now than in March 2020 in these areas. Compared to the national level, the job market recovery after the pandemic has been more than twice as fast as nationwide in these areas. There are about 6% more jobs in the Deltona metro area now compared to March 2020, while the inbound move rate was nearly 56%. Respectively, employment has increased about six percentage points since the pre-pandemic in the Charlotte metro area.</p>
<p>On the flip side, big city centers such as New York, San Francisco, and Chicago continued to lose movers. Although more people are returning to these areas as employers demand a return to the office, outbound still outpace inbound moves in these large areas. While affordability hit record lows in 2022, it is the primary reason that people continue to relocate from these big city centers to less dense and more affordable areas. Nevertheless, according to the USPS data, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Washington, DC experienced migration gains.</p>
<p><strong>Migration Before and After the Pandemic</strong></p>
<p>Compared to pre-pandemic, the Miami metro area experienced the largest inbound gains across the country. Inbound moves increased by nearly 60% in 2022 compared to 2019 in this area. Following in the list of the areas with the most inbound gains in 2022 were: Scranton, PA (45%), Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI (41%), Colorado Springs, CO (36%), and Cleveland, OH (31%). While many people continue to move out from big city centers, many areas with the most inbound gains compared to pre-pandemic regions are located near these big city centers. For example, Scranton, PA, is a couple of hours away from New York City. Even though the New York metro area also experienced inbound gains in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic, this area continues to have migration losses as more people moved out than in.</p>
<p><strong>What is Different Now vs. Before the Pandemic</strong></p>
<p>While housing is the main reason people move, data shows that housing-related moves rose even further due to the pandemic. For example, 46% of the moves were made for housing-related reasons in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This is an increase of six percentage points from the previous year. Based on the data, this increase was primarily due to people looking for a better neighborhood, cheaper housing and the desire for a newer/better/larger home. With the pandemic changing buyers’ preferences, these migration trends only go one way and affect every area’s demographics.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The plan sets housing target growth rates at 3% for downstate municipalities and 1% for upstate communities. The plan also provides incentives to facilitate transit-oriented development, removes barriers to housing creation, and incentivizes new construction.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Gov. Kathy Hochul in her address on her proposed Fiscal Year 2024 Executive Budget on Feb. 1 outlined her “New York Housing Compact” that looks to address the housing shortage in New York State by building 800,000 new homes over the next decade.</p>
<p>The plan sets housing target growth rates at 3% for downstate municipalities and 1% for upstate communities. The plan also provides incentives to facilitate transit-oriented development, removes barriers to housing creation, and incentivizes new construction.</p>
<p>The governor’s budget also had some welcome news for New York City developers as she has proposed extending the expired 421-a construction deadline through 2030. Currently, the deadline would mandate all construction that would fall under the tax exemption be completed by June 2026.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m committed to doing everything in my power to make the Empire State a more affordable, more livable, safer place for all New Yorkers,” Gov. Hochul said. “We will make bold, transformative investments that lift up New Yorkers while maintaining solid fiscal footing in uncertain times.”</p>
<p>Other key facets of the governor’s New York Housing Compact are:</p>
<p>• $250 million for infrastructure upgrades and improvements to support local housing growth and development.</p>
<p>• $20 million for planning and technical assistance to support local rezoning efforts and other solutions to drive growth.</p>
<p>• $15 million for a new statewide data collection effort.</p>
<p>• $4 million to create a new Housing Planning Office within Homes and Community Renewal to support localities in meeting their housing goals and coordinate planning efforts across the state.</p>
<p>• $39.8 million to reduce the risk of lead exposure in rental properties outside of New York City, including $20 million in assistance to property owners for building remediation, and</p>
<p>• $50 million for the creation of a statewide Homeowner Stabilization Fund to provide critical home repairs in 10 key communities with a high concentration of low-income homeowners of color.</p>
<p>The budget also expands HCR&#8217;s Tenant Protection Unit as part of a multi-year investment to provide targeted support for tenants in upstate New York.</p>
<p>The governor, who also highlighted a host of crime-reduction, health care and infrastructure initiatives, also proposed earmarking some of the revenues from downstate casinos to the beleaguered MTA. Her budget specifically calls for dedicating a share of $1.5 billion in the licensing fees if three casino licenses are awarded, and a share of an estimated $462 million to $826 million in annual tax revenue from the casinos for MTA operations. She is also proposing increasing the top rate of the Payroll Mobility Tax, which would generate an additional $800 million annually for the MTA.</p>
<p>Reaction from the business and real estate sectors was mostly positive. For example, Tony D’Anzica, President of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, termed the governor’s compact plan: “a common-sense approach to dealing with the lack of housing and housing affordability at the same time.”</p>
<p>D&#8217;Anzica noted that he supports the proposal to extend the 421a tax exemption construction deadline through 2030.</p>
<p>“With respect to The New York Housing Compact, I would say that it clearly recognizes that there is a public housing crisis in terms of both supply and affordability. Local communities need more tools and incentives that encourage the development of housing models that are more affordable, cost effective, sustainable and transit-oriented,” D’Anzica said. “While the New York Housing Compact is a step forward, many details are still missing. Dealing with these issues requires a dialogue and a close collaboration between both the state and all local communities to address the barriers and delays preventing the development of new and affordable housing.”</p>
<p>Timothy Foley, CEO and Executive Vice President of the Building and Realty Institute (BRI) and member of the Welcome Home Westchester campaign, said, “Westchester County is the poster child for why we need state leadership to help us through our housing shortage. We have so many communities like Ossining, Mamaroneck, Peekskill, Mount Vernon and others that have created transit-oriented developments that are climate-friendly, millennial- and senior-friendly, and have helped revitalize their downtowns, stabilize property taxes, and boost their local economies. We&#8217;ve also seen a handful of villages and towns move forward with thoughtful proposals to allow for accessory dwelling units. But just this month, we&#8217;ve also seen Greenburgh slam the breaks on the development of moderate-to-affordable condos and co-ops by increasing property taxes on them and Pleasantville enact a moratorium on building housing not to address a specific problem with schools or parking near the train station or some other identifiable issue, but simply because the loudest voices of the community demanded it.”</p>
<p>He added, “The governor&#8217;s approach offers a lot of options for municipalities to choose from, but the important point is that everyone needs to be part of the solution. ‘The way things have always been done’ is what got us into this mess. It&#8217;s time for something new.”</p>
<p>Carlo A. Scissura, Esq., President and CEO of the New York Building Congress also offered high praise for the governor’s proposed Executive Budget. “Gov. Hochul’s executive budget is infrastructure and housing forward, addressing today’s critical issues and continuing to move us toward more growth, fairness, and opportunity in the year ahead,” he said. “The governor rightly prioritizes initiatives that the Building Congress has long advocated for, including the extension of the 421-a tax abatement for affordable housing projects already underway and new incentives encouraging transit-oriented development across New York.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>All Professional Standard rules and procedures are developed by the National Association of Realtors and are adopted by each state and local association. Some rules and procedures are required, but others are subject to individual association adoption. One of these optional procedures is the possible adoption of a Citation Program. A Citation Program is simply a tool that provides the option to circumvent the Professional Standards Hearing process and instead imposes a fine. I’ll explain this in more detail shortly.</p>
<p>Last year, a Presidential Advisory Group (PAG) was created by then-HGAR President Anthony Domathoti, to investigate, develop and propose whether HGAR should create a Citation Program. After months of research, discussions, and meetings, the Citation PAG recommended the creation of an HGAR Citation Program and provided a framework for it to the Board of Directors. On Nov. 16, 2023, the HGAR Board of Directors voted to adopt the recommendations of the Citation PAG and the creation of an HGAR Citation Program was approved. It will be implemented sometime in 2023. So, this week I’ll go over what a Citation Program is in general, and what the HGAR Citation Program will entail.</p>
<p><strong>Citation Program</strong></p>
<p>The NAR Model Citation Program provides a template for the creation of other Citation Programs. This model limits what can and cannot be done. In short, a Citation Program is a mechanism through which a party who is accused of violating the Code of Ethics (the respondent) can “plead guilty” to certain specific offenses and pay a fine instead of appearing for a hearing. The program is designed to streamline the complaint process to conserve time and resources, so long as certain conditions are met.</p>
<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>The proposed HGAR Citation Program establishes that when a complaint is made, the Grievance Committee will review the complaint to determine if the matter can go forward (i.e., confirm timing, membership, facts, etc.). This is the same process for all complaints that are filed with HGAR. If the complaint is approved to go forward to a Professional Standards Panel, the Grievance Committee will forward the complaint to the Citation Panel to review the Articles/Standards of Practice to determine if the alleged violations coincide with one or several of the enumerated Articles/Standards of Practice on the HGAR Citation Schedule (“citable offense”). If the allegation(s) are not citable offenses, the case will be forwarded to the Professional Standards Committee for a hearing. If the allegations are a mix of citable offenses and non-citable offenses, the Citation Panel will forward the case to the Professional Standards Committee for a hearing. But, if the allegations are only citable offense(s), then the Citation Panel will issue a fine or impose discipline (Citation) consistent with the established HGAR’s Citation Schedule. However, the Citation Panel may determine that the actions alleged are so egregious that a hearing must be scheduled instead of a fine.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving a Citation and Options</strong></p>
<p>The Citation, along with the complaint and a written summary of the matter, will be sent to the respondent and the respondent’s broker. The respondent then has 20 days to agree to pay the Citation or request a hearing. If the respondent accepts the citation, or if the respondent does not request a hearing within 20 days of transmission of the Citation, this will be deemed to be a final resolution of the complaint. The resolution cannot be appealed.</p>
<p>If the respondent accepts the Citation, or if the respondent does not request a hearing within 20 days of transmission of the Citation, payment must be received by HGAR no later than five business days after the date of acceptance or after the time period to request a hearing has elapsed (i.e., 25 days). Thereafter, if respondent does not pay the Citation within 21 calendar days after the date of acceptance or after the time to request a hearing has expired, then their membership will be automatically suspended until the Citation has been paid.</p>
<p>In the alternative, if the respondent requests a hearing, the matter will be placed back on the standard Professional Standards Hearing track and scheduled for a full hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Fines and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>There is a limit on the number of total financial amounts in Citations a respondent can accumulate over a specified period of time before the respondent can no longer avail themselves of the Citation Program and must appear for a Professional Standards Hearing.</p>
<p>There can be no more than two Citations to a respondent in any consecutive 12-month period, starting on the date the first complaint was filed with HGAR.</p>
<p>There can be no more than three citations issued to a respondent within a consecutive 36-month period, starting on the date the first complaint was filed at HGAR.</p>
<p>No additional Citations are permitted where the cumulative fine for the Citations issued would be more than $5,000 in any three-year period.</p>
<p>In addition, the Citation Program will establish an escalating fine schedule for repeat Citations of the same conduct alleged.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p>Like all Professional Standards Hearings, matters that are subject to the Citation Program will remain confidential and neither the complainant, respondent, the Citation Panel, or Grievance Committee will be permitted to discuss the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the Citation Program is not earth-shattering, it does create a streamlined way for those who violate a certain Article/Standard of Practice to bypass a hearing and defend themselves in a “no-win” matter and simply pay a fine. This relieves the panels and parties from preparing for and appearing at a hearing and wasting time that could otherwise be spent working at their profession. The process properly screens out repeat offenders and provides assurances that truly offensive actions receive a full hearing. Overall, we contemplate that this new Citation Program will benefit HGAR, committee participants, complainants and staff.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In early 2023, it is clear that cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and the metaverse are on track for a significant recovery. In 2020 and 2021, increased interest in blockchain technology and significant investment in cryptocurrency and the metaverse became a major focal point for companies and investors alike. Throughout 2022, however, we witnessed what has been termed an extreme “crypto winter.”</p>
<p>With the fall of FTX in late 2022, as well as other companies in the crypto space, the belief of investors, both retail investors (i.e., individual investors) and professionals is that investment in cryptocurrency, and in companies that utilize its underlying blockchain technology for a variety of projects as a viable investment vehicle, was shaken to its core. Many pundits have called cryptocurrency a Ponzi scheme, a scam, and have called for its total collapse altogether. Many believe that it cannot be regulated and should not even be permitted to exist.</p>
<p><strong>Remembering the 2008 Financial Crisis</strong></p>
<p>Before everyone simply throws out the proverbial “baby with the bath water,” one should take a step back. It is easily forgotten that the 2008 financial crisis involved the collapse and bailout of some of the largest financial institutions and insurance companies in the nation and the world. These institutions were subject to some of the strictest regulations, and yet the entire financial system nearly suffered a total collapse.</p>
<p>Some of these companies included the biggest names in the financial and insurance sectors, like Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, as well as AIG, which was near oblivion and survived only as a result of billions in government bailout aid, just to name a few. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be basically nationalized and be run by the government. The term “too big to fail” was coined and became a well-known theme throughout the crisis. The entire financial system was saved only because the federal government, as well as other governments throughout the world, provided trillions upon trillions of dollars in bailouts to companies that were extremely overleveraged and which took extraordinary risks with funds belonging to investors and individuals.</p>
<p><strong>The Collapse of FTX and Other Exchanges in 2022</strong></p>
<p>On Nov. 11, 2022, FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, was arrested on Dec.12, 2022, in the Bahamas and then extradited to the United States. He was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud customers. Sam Bankman-Fried was worth nearly $38 billion in early 2022 and lost nearly all of that wealth by November. Investors in FTX have lost billions of dollars, and according to <em>NerdWallet</em>, “the exchange owes its top 50 creditors almost $3.1 billion combined, with almost over half of that amount ($1.45 billion) owed to just the top 10.” [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3wXVLuQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3wXVLuQ</a>]. Tens of billions of dollars were lost by the remaining investors.</p>
<p>In 2022, as reported by <em>Cointelegraph</em>, there were a number of other high-profile collapses and bankruptcy filings that occurred throughout the year in the crypto space. Some of these include the following: the hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network bridge (where $3 billion was initially stolen); the TerraUSD Luna collapse (where investors lost approximately $60 billion); the Three Arrows collapse (where $650 million was lost); the Voyager Digital collapse (where the company filed for bankruptcy and owes between $1 billion to $10 billion to debtors); the Celsius crash (where the company filed for bankruptcy having $6.6 billion in liabilities with only $3.8 billion in assets); and the BlockFi collapse and bankruptcy. [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3RxU5l0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3RxU5l0</a>].</p>
<p>It is easy to see why there was a “crypto winter” in 2022. Any one of these collapses should have brought the entire crypto market to its knees and, while there were significant losses on a percentage basis in most, if not all, cryptocurrencies in 2022, since January 1<sup>st</sup>, the entire crypto market has been on a bull run. Many cryptocurrencies and token prices, and stock prices of cryptocurrency exchanges, like Coinbase and Robinhood, have appreciated by double and triple digits on a percentage basis. In stark contrast to the 2008 financial crisis, the crypto market has been able to stabilize over the past several weeks without any government assistance, and while there have been significant losses in the space, the crypto market was able to weather the storm on its own.</p>
<p><strong>The Promise of Blockchain Technology and the Crypto Market</strong></p>
<p>One reason why the crypto market may have stabilized is because of the underlying technology that make cryptocurrencies viable, as well as the metaverse, and that is blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency and the metaverse, in their basic forms, are made possible through the use of blockchain technology.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Blockchain?</strong></p>
<p>According to IBM, “blockchain” is defined as “a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An <em>asset</em> can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.” IBM further points out that “a blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more.” Rather than simply call for the abolition of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and the metaverse, the focus should be on passing reasonable regulations. Blockchain technology is here to stay and will inevitably have an important role in many industries.</p>
<p><strong>Still a Nascent Market and Technology</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency, the metaverse and blockchain technology are still in their infancy. Investments in cryptocurrency and the metaverse will undoubtedly become more widespread. The use of blockchain technology will become a critical component of all industries, including the real estate industry. For example, Facebook, which changed its name to Meta, has made significant investments in developing the metaverse and many companies will certainly follow.</p>
<p><strong>Buying, Selling and Utilizing Real Estate in the Metaverse</strong></p>
<p>In December, <em>Inman</em> reported that The Agency Turks and Caicos, a luxury real estate franchise, opened its first fully virtual office in the virtual world of Decentraland [visit <a href="https://decentraland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://decentraland.org</a>]. [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3Gr5ZZ5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Gr5ZZ5</a>]. Decentraland is one of the first fully decentralized virtual worlds which operates through what is called a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Through the DAO, individuals are able to vote and can “control the policies created to determine how the world behaves: for example, what kinds of wearable items are allowed (or disallowed) after the launch of the DAO, moderation of content, LAND policy and auctions, among others.”</p>
<p>Decentraland also has its own virtual currency (i.e., ERC-20 token) known as MANA, which is used to pay for land in Decentraland. ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible <em>tokens</em> created using the Ethereum blockchain, which is one of the most widely-utilized blockchains in the crypto space. Since the beginning of the year, the price of the MANA token has risen more than 130%. In the same time frame, Ethereum’s price has risen more than 30% and Bitcoin has risen over 35%.</p>
<p>The Agency Turks and Caicos’ virtual office is the first brokerage-wide office that has been developed and opened to operate solely in the metaverse. The managing director, Sean O’Neill, told <em>Inman</em> that “the metaverse office will also serve as a place for agents to meet for training programs, and ultimately, office events…” and indicated “that they’re just beginning to tap into the possibilities for the office in the future.” While many may have serious reservations about pursuing investments in cryptocurrency, utilizing blockchain technology, or pursuing investments in the metaverse—the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>Buying Land in the Metaverse Utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens</strong></p>
<p>According to <em>Inman</em>, “the metaverse will be the next Internet, or Web 3.0 as it’s called, but space will be limited—just like real estate on land. So, people are jumping in headfirst to buy space in the metaverse and crossing their fingers that it’ll be a hotspot to make money in the future.” [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3RwTfVV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3RwTfVV</a>]. Real estate in the metaverse will be represented as a non-fungible token or NFT. <em>Inman</em> explains that a “non-fungible token, is built using the same programming as cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin. NFTs cannot be traded, exchanged, or replicated. They can represent real-world items, like real estate. Having the token reduces the probability of fraud because the token proves ownership.” In February 2022, virtual islands in The Sandbox, a game in the metaverse [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3wVPboz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3wVPboz</a>], sold for $2.9 million. <em>Inman</em> points out that virtual land located next to parcels owned by celebrities, such as Snoop Dog and others, can fetch a hefty premium. The Sandbox native cryptocurrency token (SAND) has also appreciated nearly 70% over the last month.</p>
<p><strong>Using Blockchain Technology </strong><strong>For R.E. Transfers, Title Insurance</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, talk of utilizing blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies for real estate transactions and title insurance purposes became more and more popular. <em>The Real Deal</em> explained that “one obvious way for [blockchain] to be used is to help make it easier for property owners to record and transfer legal ownership of their real estate, something that is known as title.” [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3YsF0n1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3YsF0n1</a>]. <em>Inman</em> indicated that since the title process is itself an inefficient process based on title searches and deed recordings handled by individuals, that “it seems like a perfect problem for the mighty blockchain technology to solve.” <em>Inman</em> points out that while many pilot projects were discussed by municipalities, in particular, relating to recording of deeds, mortgages, etc., many of these initiatives never went anywhere. There have also been some instances where cryptocurrency was used as a payment method in real estate transactions over the past few years, but the crypto winter, and volatility in cryptocurrency prices, have undoubtedly had a chilling effect on the advancement of utilizing blockchain technology and cryptocurrency payments in real estate.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain Technology, the Metaverse </strong><strong>And Cryptocurrency is Here to Stay</strong></p>
<p>As much as it may have seemed that the end was near, it is clear that blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and the metaverse are here to stay. Each of these can ultimately be utilized in a variety of ways, such as recording deeds, issuing title policies, lending, purchasing and showing property (in both virtual and non-virtual worlds), gaming, investing, conducting business on a worldwide basis using the metaverse and cryptocurrencies, and implementing new, secured forms of payment systems in worldwide commerce (which can also limit cybersecurity fraud and theft issues).</p>
<p>As is common with all emerging markets and technologies, it takes time for adoption, adaption, and ultimately, implementation. As one may recall, in 1998 there was the infamous bursting of the tech and Internet bubble. Billions of dollars were lost on investment in speculative Internet companies. Yet, nearly 25 years later, some of the largest and most influential technology companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Priceline, and many more) rose from the ashes to lead the world into new uncharted territories. One could even argue that it was not until recent events with the COVID-19 pandemic that the Internet economy really hit the next level. While everyone should be extremely careful when investing in these cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs and the like, as there is certainly high risk and volatility, it does not mean that the entire crypto and blockchain space should be discarded or ignored.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—President Joe Biden in his 72-minute address last night before a divided Congress stressed that the State of the Union is strong and pushed his economic agenda that includes trillions of dollars in funding for infrastructure, climate change and semiconductor manufacturing that is creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the construction industry alone.</p>
<p>During his speech, he touted the passage of the infrastructure bill, the CHIPs Act, the creation of more than 800,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector and low unemployment at 3.4%, a 50-year low. The President also noted that inflation has fallen from its peak last summer and gas prices have also declined by $1.50-per-gallon.</p>
<p>In referencing the many projects funded by the new infrastructure law, President Biden thanked those Republican lawmakers that voted for the bill and took a jab at those who voted against it but whose constituents benefit from the legislation.</p>
<p>“I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law. And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry. I promised to be the president for all Americans. We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the groundbreaking,” he said.</p>
<p>While GOP lawmakers pushed back on some portions of the speech, initial reaction from New York politicos and trade groups were positive.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a statement in support of the President’s speech, “In his address to the nation, President Biden highlighted significant achievements that are making a difference in the lives of all Americans &#8211; including New Yorkers: the Inflation Reduction Act is creating green jobs while fighting the climate crisis, the CHIPS and Science Act is attracting growing, innovative companies like Micron, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is helping once-in-a-generation projects like Gateway to move forward. “There is more work to do in order to make New York and the nation more affordable, more livable and safer.”</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams addressed a host of issues covered by the President in his State of the Union address. “This president’s focus on working people is exactly what the nation needs, and his focus on helping Americans care for their children, provide for their families, and put money in their wallets will resonate from coast to coast. The agenda he laid out goes hand-in-hand with what we are doing in New York City — this is a blue-collar president,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I’m a blue-collar mayor, and we’re both pursuing a blue-collar agenda for working people in New York and across the rest of the nation.” The mayor also agreed with President Biden that gun violence, the opioid epidemic and immigration reform must be addressed.</p>
<p>Carlo A. Scissura, Esq., President and CEO of the New York Building Congress, said, “President Biden has proven time and time again that his administration believes in the power of infrastructure investment as a key contributor to job creation and economic growth,&#8221; said &#8220;After hearing this idea echoed throughout his State of the Union address, our members stand ready to deliver the U.S. back to infrastructure prominence on the big-ticket projects that will lead to increased livability, accessibility, equity and resiliency for all. Because the President is right: &#8216;We used to be number one in the world in infrastructure… we’ve sunk to thirteenth…but we’re coming back … and we’re just getting started!&#8217; To that end, our advocacy on this front will remain steadfast, as we seek to expedite funding, and get our industry doing what it does best—building a better America. Let’s &#8216;finish the job&#8217; indeed.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Approximately nine out of 10 metro markets registered home price gains in the fourth quarter of 2022 despite mortgage rates eclipsing 7%, according to the National Association of Realtors’ latest quarterly report. A total of 18% of the 186 tracked metro areas registered double-digit price increases over the same time period, down from 46% in the third quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South saw the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (45%) in the third quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 4.9%. Prices grew 5.3% in the Northeast, 4.0% in the Midwest, and 2.6% in the West.</p>
<p>Compared to a year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price rose 4.0% to $378,700. Year-over-year price appreciation decelerated when compared to the previous quarter’s 8.6%.</p>
<p>“A slowdown in home prices is underway and welcomed, particularly as the typical home price has risen 42% in the past three years,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said, noting these costs increases have far surpassed wage increases and consumer price inflation of 15% and 14%, respectively, since 2019. “Far fewer metro markets experienced double-digit price gains in the latest quarter.”</p>
<p>“Even with a projected reduction in home sales this year, prices are expected to remain stable in the vast majority of the markets due to extremely limited supply,” Yun added. “Moreover, there are signs that buyers are returning as mortgage rates decline, even with inventory levels near historic lows.”</p>
<p>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year price increases all recorded gains of at least 14.5%, with seven of those markets in Florida and the Carolinas. Those include Farmington, NM (20.3%); North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, FL (19.5%); Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL (17.2%); Greensboro-High Point, NC (17.0%); Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach, SC-NC (16.2%); Oshkosh-Neenah, WI (16.0%); Winston-Salem, NC (15.7%); El Paso, TX (15.2%); Punta Gorda, FL (15.2%); and Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach, FL (14.5%).</p>
<p>Half of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California, including San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($1,577,500; -5.8%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,230,000; -6.1%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,132,000; -1.6%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,090,200; 3.4%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($857,000; 1.4%); Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($829,100; -1.3%); Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL ($802,500; 17.2%); Boulder, CO ($759,500; -2.0%); Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA ($708,900; 1.3%); and Barnstable Town, MA ($668,100; 4.0%).</p>
<p>Roughly one in 10 markets (11%; 20 of 186) experienced home price declines in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>“A few markets may see double-digit price drops, especially some of the more expensive parts of the country which have also seen weaker employment and higher instances of residents moving to other areas,” Yun added.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, housing affordability was exacerbated by elevated home prices and mortgage rates which roughly doubled from the beginning of the year. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $1,969. This represents a 7% increase from the third quarter of last year ($1,838) but a major surge of 58%—or $720—from one year ago. Families typically spent 26.2% of their income on mortgage payments, up from 25% in the prior quarter and 17.5% one year ago.</p>
<p>Once again, first-time buyers looking to purchase a typical home during the fourth quarter of 2022 encountered challenges related to housing’s growing unaffordability. For a typical starter home valued at $321,900 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment rose to $1,931, about 7% more than the previous quarter ($1,806) and an increase of almost $700, or 57%, from one year ago ($1,233). First-time buyers typically spent 39.5% of their family income on mortgage payments, up from 37.8% in the previous quarter. A mortgage is considered unaffordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) amounts to more than 25% of the family’s income.</p>
<p>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down payment mortgage in 71 markets, up from 59 in the prior quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 16 markets, down from 17 in the previous quarter.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The annual Commercial Real Estate Roundtable has certainly been known for its share of spot on, sometimes offbeat and even startling predictions over the years. The 2023 program, presented by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Commercial Investment Division, did not disappoint as the panel offered frank assessments of the office, multifamily and retail sectors and even dabbled into the political arena with views on Governor Kathy Hochul’s “The New York Compact” initiative that calls for the development of 800,000 new homes in three years and calls for downstate communities to grow their housing stock by 3%.</p>
<p>The roundtable held at the HGAR offices in White Plains on Jan. 31 was moderated by 2023 CID Chairman Clayton Livingston and featured panelists: William Cuddy, Executive Vice President, CBRE; Sarah Jones-Maturo, President, RM Friedland; Paul Adler, Chief Strategy Officer, Rand Commercial and Tom LaPerch, Director, Commercial Group, Houlihan Lawrence Commercial.</p>
<p>Looking back on 2022, CBRE’s Cuddy reported that there were two significant office transactions. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is undertaking a more than $1-billion expansion of its operations in Greenburgh-Tarrytown, leased 200,000 square feet of space at King St. in Armonk at the Swiss Re Building. The largest sales transaction was New York Presbyterian’s purchase of the Westpark Office Campus at 1111-1129 Westchester Ave., a two-building complex totaling 373,000 square feet of space for $83.5 million. The property was sold by WestPark Associates, LLC, an affiliate of Onyx Equities of Woodbridge, NJ.</p>
<p>Cuddy noted that the year-end office vacancy rate for Westchester County stood at 21.6%. Leasing activity for the year totaled 985,000 square feet, an increase of 4% from 2021’s totals and the highest volume since 2017. The county’s average asking rent, according to the recently released CBRE report was $29.55 per square foot, virtually unchanged from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Rand Commercial’s Adler said in the small-to-mid-sized leasing sector in Westchester, Rockland, Orange, and Sullivan counties, 2022 was a “very good year.”</p>
<p>Adler said in the more “meat and potatoes” niche of the commercial real estate market in the Lower Hudson Valley, the key drivers for growth in 2022 were: medical, non-profit and municipal transactions.</p>
<p>He also pointed out the growth in the hospitality sector as the region continues to evolve into a tourist destination. Adler pointed to several large hospitality deals Rand had brokered involving two major properties in Ulster and Rockland counties that are now under contract. “They are going to be significant tourism and destination locations coming to the Hudson Valley. The Ulster development involves an international investor, while the Rockland project is being spearheaded by a national West Coast investor.</p>
<p>The Hudson Valley is attracting investment in the tourism/hospitality sectors, Adler noted, in part due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. “We have seen an expansion of that market, which was really very tight around the Westchester, Rockland and the Bronx, and now the outer boroughs, the ex-urban areas are really seeing that kind of growth that we would not have seen before,” he said.</p>
<p>Another driver for that growth has been the multifamily housing boom that has taken place over the past few years, Adler added.</p>
<p>RM Friedland’s Jones-Maturo highlighted the changes taking place in the retail sector including the planned transformational redevelopments of the former Galleria Mall in White Plains and the outdated White Plains Mall.</p>
<p>“Our word for Westchester retail for the year ahead is ‘evolution,’ because the Westchester retail landscape continues to evolve,” she said. The county’s retail availability rate is down to levels posted right before the outbreak of COVID, Jones-Maturo added.</p>
<p>Vacant big box spaces in “viable retail locations” are getting filled up, she noted. For example, RM Friedland is the broker at The Center at Port Chester and leases are already out to fill space vacated by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Other shuttered Bed Bath locations in Greenburgh and Mount Vernon are also reportedly seeing strong leasing interest.</p>
<p>The Bronx is seeing a major increase in national retailer interest and asking rents are up significantly over 2021. Recently Target announced its fifth location in the borough.</p>
<p>Jones-Maturo noted that Westchester County’s industrial market is very tight at about a 6% availability rate. Asking prices are the highest on record at more than $19-per-square-foot. Property owners have moved forward on some speculative industrial projects in Westchester, she added.</p>
<p>The Bronx industrial market has pulled back after a protracted period of new development projects hitting the market and currently several blocks of 500,000 square feet of space are currently available in the borough.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence’s LaPerch said that his firm saw growth in activity in 2022 and sees the redevelopment of Port Chester’s TOD continuing in 2023.</p>
<p>Another hot market for the brokerage firm was the industrial market north of I-84.</p>
<p>“The pandemic opened up the corridors up north (for industrial uses),” he noted. Now in 2023, the Northern Westchester market is seeing interest from both industrial and multifamily developers.</p>
<p>“We anticipate 2023 to be a very active year in terms of more people looking for value plays,” LaPerch said. “I think it is really a good time to be a broker.”</p>
<p><strong>Interesting Observations/Predictions</strong></p>
<p>CBRE’s Cuddy said the amount of vacant office space in Westchester County equates to lining up 160 empty football fields. The vacant office space in Westchester (calculated at four jobs per 1,000 square feet) would accommodate 28,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The current return to work ratio for Westchester office space is currently between 45% to 50%. Cuddy said that hybrid work programs are here to stay.</p>
<p>In terms of Gov. Hochul’s “New York Compact” initiative, Cuddy said that outdated and mostly vacant office properties are ideal for conversion to multifamily since all have the infrastructure already in place. He said the proposed legislation “has the opportunity to create such a dramatic shift in the commercial real estate market and is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have seen and will see impacting our business” and urged the business community to support the governor’s housing program.</p>
<p>Jones-Maturo said that in order to meet the governor’s housing growth targets, “adaptive reuse is going to be critical,” but she questioned whether small communities such as Larchmont or Hastings-on-Hudson will be able to meet those targets.</p>
<p>“Experiential Retail” will also be a continuing trend to bring new life into some properties. Jones-Maturo said there are approximately 40 pickleball users in the market at the moment.</p>
<p>Alder agreed with LaPerch that the time is right to be a broker, adding that Rand Commercial is very busy trying to secure deals. Adler said that he expects 2023 to be another strong year for the commercial market. He advised the gathering: “This time, with this technology, really requires you to go out and canvass. There is just no other alternative.”</p>
<p>LaPerch said that there is a definite need for more affordable/workforce housing, adding that there has been too much senior housing-only projects developed in the region.</p>
<p>The sponsor of the program was Webster Bank.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>MOUNT PLEASANT, NY—Add Mount Pleasant Town Supervisor Carl Fulgenzi to a growing list of mainly Republican government officials who have come out against Gov. Kathy Hochul’s “New York Compact” housing plan that calls for the development of 800,000 new housing units over the next three years.</p>
<p>Fulgenzi in a prepared statement cited the state’s home rule law in his opposition to the governor’s proposal that calls for downstate communities to increase their housing stock by 3%. The Republican Town Supervisor states that he will strongly oppose Hochul’s plan to potentially override local zoning and planning regulations, calling the initiative “unconstitutional, unnecessary and a very real threat to the character and quality of life in municipalities state-wide.”</p>
<p>“The governor’s proposal to force communities to add housing where she thinks it should be is a slap in the face to every local municipality in the state,” Fulgenzi stated. “I still believe in government by the people, for the people, not something dictated or mandated by one level of government on another. And that is the direction the governor has decided to go by attempting to force her will through her New York Housing Compact.”</p>
<p>The governor’s plan also focuses on promoting the development of new housing communities adjacent to MTA train stations, which would impact both Valhalla and Hawthorne that are part of the Town of Mount Pleasant.</p>
<p>Fulgenzi noted that Mount Pleasant recently amended its Comprehensive Plan after four years of thorough study and community input. “Our focus was on the commercial corridors adjacent to the Metro-North Harlem line and the Valhalla and Hawthorne stations. We have created the opportunity for new, smart and appropriately scaled transit-oriented, multi-family uses in the limited re-zoned areas,” he said. “One project is already underway, and others are in the discussion stages. We are doing our part to provide new housing opportunities, and we will continue to do so in ways that are appropriate for our community.”</p>
<p>The Mount Pleasant Town Supervisor is not the only GOP lawmaker to come out against Hochul’s “New York Compact” initiative. Rockland County Executive Ed Day released a statement of opposition shortly after the governor outlined her proposal earlier this month.</p>
<p>Day said that he and the county’s Planning Department believe that a component of the plan that promotes Accessory Dwelling Units “is extremely problematic and does not account for differences between rural, suburban and urban communities and I’m concerned there is a strong likelihood that the character of our county could be changed forever.”</p>
<p>Like Fulgenzi, Rockland County Executive Day also bristled at the compact’s requirements for municipalities to change zoning to meet mandatory housing goals stating that the concept violates the State Constitution. Day stated that he “will continue to stand firmly in opposition to any politically-based plan that undermines New York State Home Rule regulations and municipal law ordinances. My administration will keep all our options open in order to stop this plan in its tracks.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-17) also announced his strong opposition to the Hochul housing plan.</p>
<p>“Threatening to remove a municipality’s control of local zoning if they don’t meet housing goals while not providing the adequate resources necessary for said municipalities to improve their infrastructure to support the additional population is oxymoronic,” said Rep. Lawler. “It’s a direct assault on towns like Mount Pleasant, Yorktown, Carmel, Clarkstown, and others all across the 17th District, and we won’t tolerate it.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Approximately 300 Realtor members, as well as federal, state and county political leaders were on hand for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ 2023 Installation gala on Feb. 2 at the lavish Marina Del Rey in the Bronx.

<p>New York State Association of Realtors President John Vernazza was on hand to officially install HGAR President D’Anzica, Broker-Owner of Dynamax Realty NYC, Inc., and the 2023 HGAR Executive Officers.</p>
<p>HGAR Interim CEO/Chief Operating Officer Jana Currier offered welcoming remarks and installed the 2023 HGAR Board of Directors. Eliezer Rodriguez, HGAR Regional Government Affairs Director/Director Bronx Chapter offered the Pledge of Allegiance, while HGAR Board Director Christina Stevens gave the invocation.</p>
<p>“We were so excited to host this year’s Installation Gala in the Bronx, which became part of HGAR in 2021”, said Jana Currier, Interim CEO and COO. “Our association is proud to welcome Tony as our 2023 President as well as our 2023 Board of Directors in their new roles this year. We look forward to working with them all.”</p>
<p>As a preview to D’Anzica’s 2023 platform speech where he stressed the association’s efforts in 2023 to “making the Bronx a priority,” he, along with the Bronx elected officials in attendance, presented HGAR&#8217;s Rodriguez with a new American flag to fly above HGAR’s Bronx Chapter offices.</p>

<p>D’Anzica began his career in 1997 at Borah, Goldstein, Altschuler, Nahins &amp; Goidel, one of New York City’s most prominent real estate law firms. In 2006, D’Anzica became a licensed real estate broker and joined the former Manhattan Association of Realtors. In 2010, D’Anzica became a MANAR Director and just six years later, he was elected President of MANAR. That same year, in 2016, he successfully spearheaded the merger of MANAR with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. With the merger complete, he joined the Board of Directors of HGAR in 2017 as the Regional Director for Manhattan.</p>
<p>Since then, he has served on multiple HGAR committees, including co-chair of HGAR’s Global Business Council. D’Anzica was responsible for expanding the annual Global Real Estate Summit from a collaboration between two local Realtor associations to an international event partnering with 11 Realtor associations, including the National Association of Realtors and the Canadian Real Estate Association. HGAR’s Global Business Council has garnered multiple accolades over the years, winning NAR’s coveted Global Ambassador of the Year Award and the 2022 Platinum Global Achievement Award.</p>
<p>Additionally, D’Anzica serves as a Director of both the National Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>In his acceptance speech, D’Anzica noted the growth of the association, with its humble beginnings back in 1916 representing Westchester Realtors to the organization it is today, considered as one of the largest and most influential associations in New York State and the United States. He noted that HGAR now boasts 14,000 members and has a jurisdiction that covers six counties from the Hudson Valley to the Bronx and Manhattan.</p>
<p>He highlighted the role of the Realtor, the industry’s Code of Ethics, its commitment to Fair Housing and eliminating discrimination in the housing process and advocacy for key legislation, including co-op transparency and other pro-consumer bills that became law thanks to the efforts of HGAR. D’Anzica also noted that once again HGAR held a highly successful Global Summit in New York City and advanced its groundbreaking efforts in the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion arena by staging the first-ever DEI Summit in 2022.</p>
<p>He concluded his remarks by saying, &#8220;Let’s celebrate what COVID prevented us from celebrating two years ago,” D’Anzica said. “As part of my Bronx initiative this year, let’s begin right now to demonstrate our association’s commitment to this great borough. So, together with all of our local elected officials who are here…let us celebrate and welcome the Bronx into the Hudson Gateway family and let’s do it Bronx style!”</p>
<p>The Installation program concluded with the recognition of 2022 HGAR Award Winners by HGAR Recognition Committee Chair Katheryn DeClerck. Afterwards, the entertainment facet of the event went into high gear with Tito Puente Jr. And His Jazz Ensemble prompting many to the dance floor.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ARMONK— The Building and Realty Institute released a new study on Feb. 16 entitled: The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act: An Analysis of Early Impacts in Westchester County” that revealed both tangible fiscal impacts, as well as unintended consequences of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) enacted into law in 2019 on the real estate market within Westchester County.</p>
<p>Part of the HSTPA involved changing a number of programs whereby property owners with rent-stabilized units could increase rents on new or renewing tenants. A previous vacancy bonus, which allowed landlords to add a fixed percentage to the rent when there is a change in tenant to help pay for renovations, had been eliminated entirely. Programs related to Major Capital Improvements, such as replacing a boiler or renovating an outdated elevator or Individual Apartment Improvements like repairing major wear and tear or replacing outdated appliances or fixtures were both greatly reduced in terms of the money that could be recouped and the period of time that such reimbursements needed to be spread out over, the report stated.</p>
<p>Key findings of the report include:</p>
<p>• There has been a measurable decrease in the number of MCI applications since HSTPA became law.</p>
<p>• There has been a decrease in the annual dollar amount on repairs and maintenance in rent-stabilized apartments.</p>
<p>• Allowable rent increases in Westchester for rent-stabilized buildings have not kept up with the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>• Buildings with low-rent units may have a more difficult time recouping the costs of major capital improvements.</p>
<div id="attachment_43764" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43764" class="wp-image-43764" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PATTERN-ADAM-BOSCH.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-43764" class="wp-caption-text">Adam Bosch, CEO of Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress</p></div>
<p>“The data collected for this study found a decrease in the number of applications for the maintenance and upkeep of buildings that are subject to HSTPA in Westchester County,” Pattern for Progress CEO Adam Bosch said. “These data need to be collected and tracked in future years to understand whether that decrease in applications is an effect of the law, an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a combination of both.”</p>
<p>Bosch added, “Our study will allow organizations like the BRI to track those changes over time to make fact-based conclusions about HSTPA and its impacts on renters and building owners. To help in that effort, the state Division of Homes and Community Renewal should post MCI applications, approvals and other data in a public portal to improve tracking and accountability for all.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Albany revised the rent-stabilization laws, we&#8217;ve heard from numerous property owners that the sweeping changes to the Individual Apartment Improvements and Major Capital Improvement programs had made it financially infeasible to do much more than patch over renovation and repair issues,” BRI CEO Tim Foley said.</p>
<p>He later noted, “We believe their report gives both policymakers and advocates a lot to consider on how we reach our shared goals of providing housing that is affordable, safe, stable, and dignified.&#8221;</p>
<p>To conduct the study objectively, Pattern employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In addition to interviews with various stakeholders, including building owners, housing advocates, housing lenders, and others, Pattern captured the potential quantitative impacts of HSTPA through an analysis of historic WRGB rent increases compared to the rate of inflation, an evaluation of changes to the IAI and MCI programs, an analysis of applications and orders under the MCI program before and after the legislation was passed, and a review of annual income and expense reports.</p>
<p>The BRI noted that primary limitations of the study were the short amount of time that has passed since HSTPA was adopted in 2019, the concurrent timing of THE COVID-19 pandemic with the passage of HSTPA which affected tenants, building owners, and the economy at large, and, in some cases, the quality of data available.</p>
<p>The Building and Realty Institute of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region, which is based in Armonk, has more than 1,800 members in 14 counties of New York State, including home builders, commercial builders, renovators, property managing agents, co-op and condo boards, and owners of multifamily apartment buildings in many communities, as well as suppliers and service providers with a special focus on real estate.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul traveled from Albany to the Pace University Elisabeth Haub School of Law here on Feb. 21 to announce a host of funding awards to communities in the Mid-Hudson Region to finance downtown revitalization campaigns and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul announced that the City of Port Jervis will receive $10 million in funding as the Mid-Hudson Region winner of the sixth round of the Downtown Revitalization Initiative. For DRI Round 6, each of the state&#8217;s 10 economic development regions are being awarded $10 million, to make for a total state commitment of $100 million in funding and investments to help communities boost their economies by transforming downtowns into vibrant neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The governor also reported at the event held at Pace University’s White Plains campus that the Village of Sleepy Hollow and the Town of Cornwall and the Village of Cornwall-on-Hudson, will each receive $4.5 million in funding as the two Mid-Hudson Region winners of the first round of NY Forward.</p>
<p>“Our Downtown Revitalization Initiative is helping communities across New York reinvigorate their downtowns, jumpstart their economies, and attract the businesses and jobs that allow residents to thrive,” Gov. Hochul said. “With this award, the City of Port Jervis will begin a new chapter toward revitalizing its downtown and growing its local economy as a scenic destination for community members and visitors alike.”</p>
<p>Port Jervis, located on the banks of the Delaware and Neversink rivers at the juncture of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has seen recent local private investments over the past several years that are helping to create momentum for downtown revitalization. Port Jervis&#8217;s vision for revitalization is to combine its historic charm with modern technologies and methods that support climate sustainability, business opportunities and residents, while promoting its outdoor activities along the wild, scenic Delaware River and mountainsides. The village seeks to realize its vision by enhancing downtown attractions, adding housing in new and existing buildings, creating safer streets, enhancing multi-modal transportation options and connectivity and improving energy efficiency throughout the community, state officials noted.</p>
<p>Sleepy Hollow has recently experienced reinvestment from major institutions and businesses, including regional health centers and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, as well as substantial private investment to create residential units for nearly 3,000 new residents. To successfully seize the opportunity offered by these investments, state officials related that Sleepy Hollow is seeking to create more attractive and safer streets with unique placemaking components, redevelop vacant and underutilized lots and add housing at multiple price points.</p>
<p>Cornwall has recently seen an influx of visitors in recent years partially due to these nearby assets. The town and village have been planning for and investing in revitalization that would make these downtowns into a unique destination in an area full of attractions while continuing to improve the quality of life for residents of this community. To further this progress, the Town of Cornwall and the Village of Cornwall-on Hudson seek to connect their two downtowns, enhance placemaking and public spaces and revitalize underutilized buildings and sites throughout the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The governor also announced the creation of a $150-million Mid-Hudson Momentum Fund, which is targeted at financing mixed-use housing and infrastructure projects throughout the Mid-Hudson Region.</p>
<p>Private companies, not-for-profits, municipalities, and public benefit corporations including IDAs and LDCs are eligible to apply and the funding will be broken up equally into mixed-use housing projects and essential infrastructure projects with awards ranging from $2 million to $10 million. A 50% match will be required for all projects. Detailed information will be available on the ESD website and interested parties may sign up to be notified when the fund is open and accepting applications at: <a href="http://esd.ny.gov/momentum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESD.ny.gov/momentum</a>.</p>
<p>She later highlighted a number of specific sectors that will receive funding from her proposed budget, including</p>
<p>• $3.6 billion in School Aid for the Mid-Hudson Valley Region</p>
<p>• A $250 million housing infrastructure fund and $20 million for planning assistance</p>
<p>$240 million in DOT capital projects, including: $51 million for bridge repair/replacement; $45 million for the Wurts Street Bridge project in Kingston; $30 million for new Route 17 interchange ramps; $60 million for improvements at Bear Mountain State Park; $14.8 million for improvements at Bellayre Mountain and $1.5 million for Neighborhood and Rural Preservation housing funding.</p>
<p>The governor also stated that a host of community colleges will receive state funding for their respective capital project: Ulster County CC, $5.1 million; Dutchess County CC, $2.3 million; Orange County, CC, $1 million; Sullivan County CC, $625,000 and Westchester CC, $2.9 million.</p>
<p>In reaction to the Port Jervis award, the $30 million earmarked for Route 17 improvements and other project awards, Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus said, “I congratulate the communities of Port Jervis and Cornwall/Cornwall-on-Hudson for this well-deserved infusion of state grant funds. At the same time, New York State is long overdue in making good on its investment into the 17-Forward-86 improvements. The state must continue to provide funding for this important project as Orange County’s economic development continues to grow and attract businesses and visitors alike to this corridor.”</p>
<p>“It has been my privilege to serve on the Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council since its inception and I am honored to have played a role in securing transformational investment for Orange County,” said Maureen Halahan, President and CEO of the Orange County Partnership.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>SLATE HILL—Scannell Properties of Indianapolis, IN and Seattle, WA-based Amazon have filed a joint application with the Orange County Industrial Development Agency for tax incentives in connection with their proposed $229-million, 925,000-square-foot warehouse distribution project to be built on 100 acres of a former commercial sand gravel mine here.</p>
<p>The proposed “Slate Hill Commerce Center” is located at 22 McBride Road and Hoops Road in Slate Hill in the Town of Wawayanda. If the project secures all approvals and moves forward it would mark the entrance of international industrial real estate development firm Scannell Properties into Orange County. Amazon on the other hand already has extensive operations in Orange County with a 1-million-square-foot warehouse/distribution facility in Montgomery (opened in 2021) and leased space in New Windsor. The firm is also building a 631,000-square-foot warehouse in Fishkill in Dutchess County, according to<em> Mid Hudson News</em>. Officials with the development project appeared before the Orange County IDA on Feb. 15.</p>
<p>The Slate Hill Commerce Center project would also involve the cessation of all commercial mining operations at the property. According to documents filed with the Orange County IDA, the project applicant: Scannell Properties #600 and Amazon.com Services LLC, secured a negative declaration to its proposed Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Oct. 12, 2022, by the Town of Wawayanda.</p>
<p>Once completed, all of the 925,000-square-foot building, which would include some office space, would be leased by Amazon. In total, Scannell and Amazon are seeking nearly $10.7 million in sales and mortgage recording tax incentives to develop the warehouse facility.</p>
<p>In its paperwork with the IDA, Scannell/Amazon estimated that construction could start on the project in the second quarter of 2023 and be completed anywhere from the third quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025. When operational, the project is expected to create 150 new jobs. No estimates were provided on the number of construction jobs that would be created during development.</p>
<p>The IDA filings break down the project cost as follows:</p>
<p>• Property Acquisition: $27,780,000</p>
<p>• Value of Improvements: $148,921,091</p>
<p>• Engineering/Architectural services: $2,700,000</p>
<p>• Soft Costs: $25,000,000</p>
<p>• Total Capital Costs (Scannell Properties): $204,401,091</p>
<p>• Amazon: (Equipment Purchases, Fixtures, Furnishings); $25,000,000</p>
<p><strong>• Total Development Cost: $229,401,091</strong></p>
<p>The project will be developed with $153,300,818 of bank financing and $51,100,273 of equity.</p>
<p>Scannell Properties is seeking a $7,486,658 sales tax exemption and a $1,149,756 in mortgage recording tax exemption in connection with its property acquisition and development costs. Amazon has filed with the IDA seeking $2,031,250 in sales tax exemptions for its investment in the project.</p>
<p><strong>Incentives Sought:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scannell Properties</strong></p>
<p>Sales Tax Exemption $7,486,658<br />
Mortgage Tax Exemption: $1,149,756</p>
<p>Total: $8,636,414</p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong></p>
<p>Sales Tax Exemption: $2,031,250</p>
<p><strong>Total Value of Combined Incentives: $10,667,664</strong></p>
<p>The second major Amazon warehouse project in Orange County comes as Amazon is reportedly cancelling plans to build dozens of warehouse facilities across the United States in reaction to lower sales growth. <em>Bloomberg</em> first reported that consulting firm MWPVL stated that Amazon is either closing or abandoning plans to open 42 facilities across the country totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Feb. 24 a $2.2-million expansion of New York’s Fair Housing Testing Program designed to root out discrimination in home rental and sale transactions.</p>
<p>New York State has partnered with six nonprofit organizations across the state to deploy undercover testers to act as potential renters and home seekers. The expansion will increase proactive investigations of suspected housing discrimination and enhance education and outreach efforts on fair housing rights, including for individuals with a history of criminal system involvement.</p>
<p>“As we expand access to housing across New York State, I am using all of the resources at my disposal to combat housing discrimination and ensure that all New Yorkers are treated with dignity, fairness, and respect when seeking the housing of their choice,” Gov. Hochul said. “Our investment in this crucial program sends a clear message: housing discrimination will not be tolerated here in New York.”</p>
<p>The Fair Housing Testing Program is administered by the New York State Homes and Community Renewal’s Fair and Equitable Housing Office and expands the pilot testing program established by the office in 2021.</p>
<div id="attachment_43858" style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43858" class="wp-image-43858" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Marlene-Zarfes-e1544547078948-823x1024.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-43858" class="wp-caption-text">Marlene Zarfes is the Executive Director of White Plains-based Westchester Residential Opportunities. WRO has entered into a contract with New York State to conduct undercover fair housing testing in the Lower Hudson Valley region.</p></div>
<p>HCR has finalized contracts with six organizations to conduct testing in 48 counties including Nassau and Suffolk, Westchester, Albany and Schenectady counties, as well as the five boroughs of New York City. The fair housing testing and outreach partners are: CNY Fair Housing, the Fair Housing Justice Center, Housing Opportunities Made Equal, Legal Assistance of Western New York, Long Island Housing Services, and Westchester Residential Opportunities. These nonprofit housing agencies will dispatch trained fair housing &#8220;testers&#8221; to act as potential renters or home seekers to uncover unlawful discriminatory treatment by sellers, brokers, and landlords.</p>
<p>The program’s outreach and training will focus on fair housing protections including for those with arrest and conviction histories. The outreach includes advertisements and social media messaging, training events, and professional education classes. The program also provides continuity to the Eliminating Barriers to Housing New York testing and outreach program launched by the New York Office of the Attorney General in partnership with Enterprise Community Partners.</p>
<p>New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “Housing is an essential human right and we must continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that all New Yorkers have a fair and equal opportunity to live in the communities of their choice. Our Fair Housing Testing program complements Governor Hochul’s New York Housing Compact, which will proactively address disparities in housing access, exclusionary zoning, and other barriers that impede fair housing goals, and help us build a better and more equitable New York for all.”</p>
<p>Marlene Zarfes, Executive Director of Westchester Residential Opportunities, said, “This work is critical to ensuring a housing market in the Lower Hudson Valley in which every household has an equal opportunity to participate, regardless of skin color, ethnicity, source of income, disability or any other protected class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Grossman, Executive Director of the Fair Housing Justice Center, said, “The Fair Housing Justice Center is immensely grateful for this support from HCR and we are eager to get to work on new testing and outreach activities. Testing remains a critical tool for fair housing organizations to use in the fight against discrimination, and we look forward to conducting robust investigations throughout the New York City region. The outreach funding will provide an enhanced opportunity for us to increase awareness of fair housing rights and responsibilities, especially the strong protections that New York State has put in place to counter source-of-income discrimination, and to provide training to tenants, home seekers, and housing providers. Thanks to the support of HCR, people throughout our service area will know that they can come to us for help, and that our programs will get them the help they need.”</p>
<p>Ian Wilder, Executive Director of Long Island Housing Services, said, “Long Island Housing Services is grateful to New York State for supporting much needed fair housing work. This funding allows us to assist in enforcing the very necessary protections afforded under New York State law. Even more so, it enables Long Islanders to move toward a home that we all strive for where our neighbors can choose to live wherever they want free of discrimination. Only by overcoming housing discrimination can we free Long Islanders to live their best lives.”</p>
<p>More information on Fair Housing can be found on HCR’s website: <a href="http://hcr.ny.gov/feho" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hcr.ny.gov/feho</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>It is an absolute pleasure to be writing this column. Not only is this the first time a Government Affairs Director has provided a column in many months, but also, this is my first opportunity to introduce myself to the HGAR membership. On top of that, we are weeks away from Lobby Day!</p>
<p>My name is Alex Roithmayr, and I am the new Government Affairs Director for HGAR. I am a long-time resident of Westchester County and grew up in the City of White Plains. I have a background in the New York State Legislature, spending most of the 2010s working as a Chief of Staff for a local Assemblymember. Following a run for elective office, I joined the Building and Realty Institute of the Hudson Valley as the Strategic Research Associate and Campaign Lead for Welcome Home Westchester, a pro-housing issue campaign that is still driving the conversation around housing today.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Recently, the HGAR Legislative Committee held a meeting where we outlined several legislative goals for this year.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR is in Opposition to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>• (S.305-Salazar</strong>) HGAR opposes the imposition of a statewide “good cause” eviction standard, which would implement impractical and overly restrictive standards and stifle investment in rental housing.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2783-Brisport)</strong> HGAR opposes the prohibition of landlords and landlords’ agents from collecting broker fees from a tenant.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2352-Kavanagh)</strong> HGAR opposes the requirement on real estate brokers and salespersons to request, compile and disclose personal demographic data on prospective home purchasers, including full name, race, ethnicity and gender, among other information.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2505-Kavanagh)</strong> The New York State Association of Realtors opposes the creation of a statewide residential rental registry and public online searchable database that would require owners of residential rental dwellings, housing two or more families living independently of each other, to register their property annually for a fee to be determined by the Department of State.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.221-Myrie)</strong> HGAR opposes the establishment of the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would provide tenant organizations the first opportunity to purchase rental properties prior to being put on the market, impose price stabilization provisions on the property for up to 99 years, cap annual rent increases and prohibit the eviction of any TOPA buyer except for “good cause.”</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2353-Kavanagh)</strong> HGAR opposes the requirement of property owners to conduct lead paint tests and provide reports of such tests prior to the selling or leasing of a property.</p>
<p>• HGAR opposes regulatory efforts by the Department of State to impose any new cease and desist zone on real estate licensees.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Supports:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Measures to Expand Access to Homeownership</strong></p>
<p>• HGAR supports enacting a first-time homebuyer savings account program to assist New Yorkers in saving for a first home within the state (bill introduction pending).</p>
<p>• HGAR supports expanding affordable and workforce housing development through the implementation of new zoning and tax incentives and easing restrictions on the conversion of existing commercial spaces into residential housing.</p>
<p>• HGAR supports directing funding in the New York State Budget to expand broadband access throughout the state, particularly in rural regions.</p>
<p><strong>Combating Discrimination in Cooperative Housing</strong></p>
<p><strong>• (A.1778-Lavine) (A.2685-Walker)</strong> HGAR supports ensuring fairness and transparency in the cooperative housing purchase process by establishing a clear timeline for the response to applicants by co-op boards and requiring a reason for any denial of an application in order to help combat illegal discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.412-Thomas)</strong> HGAR supports a technical amendment to a law passed in 2019 placing restrictions on legitimate telemarketing business services provided by licensed professionals, stipulating the ability to provide telemarketing services during states of emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are many other issues still being flushed out at press time that will be addressed prior to Lobby Day.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Lobby Day</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday, May 2nd is NYSAR’s Lobby Day in Albany. This is where HGAR, and other boards/associations across the state, get to take their agendas and make their voices heard. In order to do this, I need you to show up! This is a free and fun trip to Albany where you get the opportunity to meet with your State Representatives and make clear to them the issues that are important to our members and our industry.</p>
<p>So, if you feel that state government is focusing on the wrong issues week-after-week, then <strong>I need you to get on the bus.</strong></p>
<p>If you feel that your state representative is wildly misinformed and hurting your bottom line, <strong>get on the bus!</strong></p>
<p>If you have an opinion on broker’s fees or rents for life, or not being able to make calls during endless states of emergencies, then come to Albany and stand with your fellow Realtors! I need you to advocate, educate and activate our elected leaders to work for us and not against us. <strong>I need you to get on the bus!</strong></p>
<p>We have two busses to take you to and from Albany. One bus will leave at 5:50 a.m. from outside the HGAR offices at 110 Bloomingdale Rd., White Plains, and will stop at the DeCicco’s Market in Brewster at 6:30 a.m., before arriving in Albany. The other bus will depart at 5:50 a.m. from the former HGAR office in Nyack, located at 2 Medical Park Drive, and will stop at 6:30 a.m. at the rear of the Newburgh Mall, before continuing to Albany. Both busses will depart Albany after lunch to return home.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>One of the pleasures of my position is to make you feel heard and make you feel empowered. I am so excited to have joined the HGAR team in this capacity. Again, I want to encourage you to get involved and join us on May 2nd. Additional information and details for Lobby Day can be found at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/event/lobby-day-in-albany-20230502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/event/lobby-day-in-albany-20230502</a> or you can contact me directly at <a href="mailto:Alexander.Roithmayr@HGAR.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander.Roithmayr@HGAR.com</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Jan. 5, 2023, the Federal Trade Commission issued a proposed rule (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3T5ixuM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3T5ixuM</a>] (“Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” or NPRM), that would ban employers from imposing non-compete clauses and agreements on employees. The public comment period for the NPRM ends on April 19, 2023. The rule’s genesis stems from an Executive Order issued by President Biden in July 2021, which focused on promoting competition in America. The FTC describes the use of non-compete provisions as a “widespread and often exploitative practice that suppresses wages, hampers innovation, and block entrepreneurs from starting new businesses.” Those who oppose the FTC’s view argue that non-compete provisions are vital, long-standing tools that protect an employer’s legitimate business interests and protect businesses from harm caused by departing employees.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictive Covenants: Non-Compete and Other Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Black’s Law Dictionary defines “restrictive covenants” in the employment context as “clauses in contracts of partnership and employment which limit a contracting party after termination of the contract in performing similar work for a period of time and within a certain geographical area.” Restrictive covenants are utilized to address a variety of circumstances such as non-competition and non-solicitation arrangements, as well as restrictions relating to confidential information and trade secrets obtained by employee while working for the employer.</p>
<p>Normally, restrictive covenants are written agreements (or clauses included in agreements) entered into between employers and employees. In recent years, these restrictive covenants are being utilized in the real estate industry in independent contractor agreements between brokers and real estate agents and members of significant teams, as well as employment and severance agreements between brokers and high-ranking executives and employees employed by the employer.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictive Covenants Are Permissible in New York</strong></p>
<p>Although restrictive covenants are generally closely scrutinized by the courts in New York (and other states), these types of agreements and provisions are permissible under New York law. The FTC explains in its NPRM that “In the 47 states [including New York] where at least some non-compete clauses may be enforced, courts use a reasonableness inquiry to determine whether to enforce a non-compete clause, in addition to whatever statutory limits they are bound to apply.” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3YwXUZK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3YwXUZK</a>]. It is important to note that non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants are recognized in all but three states and have been long allowed under the law.</p>
<p><strong>The Reasonableness Test</strong></p>
<p>In <em>BDO Seidman v. Hirshberg</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3kXhNM1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3kXhNM1</a>], the New York Court of Appeals held that “The modern, prevailing common-law standard of reasonableness for employee agreements not to compete applies a three-pronged test. A restraint is reasonable only if it: (1) is no greater than is required for the protection of the legitimate interest of the employer, (2) does not impose undue hardship on the employee, and (3) is not injurious to the public. A violation of any prong renders the covenant invalid.” It is important that legal advice is sought before utilizing restrictive covenants in any employment or other agreement. If the non-compete provision or restrictive covenant is over-broad and does not meet the requirements of the tests laid out by the courts, it will be invalidated.</p>
<p><strong>Interests Protected by Non-Compete </strong><strong>Agreements in New York State</strong></p>
<p>In New York, courts have issued a variety of decisions which outline “protectable interests” of an employer. In New York, the courts “have limited the employer interests, which can justify the imposition of post-employment restraints to (1) protection of confidential customer information, (2) protection of trade secrets, (3) protection of an employer’s client base, and (4) protection against irreparable harm where an employee’s services are unique or extraordinary.” [See <em>Summary of Covenants Not to Compete: A Global Perspective </em>at <a href="https://bit.ly/3kXDcEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3kXDcEN</a>]. The courts have generally upheld restrictive covenants where trade secrets and confidential information are involved, as well as non-solicitation of existing customers and clients.</p>
<p>Courts have also held that a restrictive covenant is enforceable where an employee’s services are unique or extraordinary [see <em>Shearshon Lehman Bros., Inc. v. Schmetzler</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZZDCZQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ZZDCZQ</a>]. In many cases, where an employee’s services are found to be unique, special and/or extraordinary, the courts have held that an employer would be entitled to injunctive relief. However, the courts have held that any such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis and will be scrutinized carefully [see <em>Ticor Title Insurance Co. v. Cohen </em>at <a href="https://bit.ly/3JvXgaC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3JvXgaC</a>].</p>
<p><strong>The FTC’s Newly Proposed Rule </strong><strong>On Banning Non-Compete Clauses</strong></p>
<p>The FTC explains that “The rule would provide that noncompete clauses are an unfair method of competition. As a result, the rule would ban employers from entering [into] noncompete clauses with their workers, including independent contractors.” [See NPRM at <a href="https://bit.ly/3ywY4G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ywY4G0</a>]. This new rule simply makes illegal an invaluable tool that has been available to employers and brokers for many years.</p>
<p><strong>‘Non-Compete Clause’ Defined </strong><strong>And The FTC’s ‘Functionality Test’</strong></p>
<p>Under Section 910.1(b)(1) a “non-compete clause” is defined as “a contractual term between an employer and a worker that prevents the worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person, or operating a business, after the conclusion of the worker’s employment with the employer.” Although the new rule seems to apply only to non-compete clauses, the rule also provides a “Functionality Test” to determine if other types of restrictive covenants or agreements, which may not, on their face, prevent an employee or worker from accepting or seeking employment, but by its terms has the same effect. [see Section 910.1(b)(2) at <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZE6BCJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ZE6BCJ</a>].</p>
<p>The FTC’s Functionality Test [see Section 910.1(b)(2) at <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZE6BCJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ZE6BCJ</a>] basically provides that “the term non-compete clause includes a contractual term that is a <em>de facto </em>non-compete clause because it has the effect of prohibiting the worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operating a business after the conclusion of the worker’s employment with the employer.” According to the FTC’s new rule, if an agreement or restrictive covenant is entered into that effectively restricts the employee from going to a competitor firm or company, then that provision would be invalid. Additionally, if there are liquidated damages provisions or required payments included that may also be deemed to be a de facto non-compete clause prohibited by the FTC’s new rule.</p>
<p><strong>Generally, NDAs, Non-Solicitation </strong><strong>Agreements Permitted</strong></p>
<p>The FTC does clarify in its NPRM that “…the definition of non-compete clause would generally not include other types of restrictive employment covenants—such as non-disclosure agreements (“NDAs”) and client or customer non-solicitation agreements—because these covenants generally do not prevent a worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operating a business after the conclusion of the worker’s employment with the employer.” However, one must be careful that any NDA, non-solicitation agreement or other restrictive covenant is not “…so unusually broad in scope that they function [and] as such would be considered non-compete clauses&#8230;,” thereby failing the Functionality Test. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3J8GyfZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3J8GyfZ</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Broad Definition of ‘Worker’</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that the new rule would not only apply to W-2 employees, but also to all individuals defined as “workers,” which “includes, without limitation, an employee, individual classified as an independent contractor, extern, intern, volunteer, apprentice, or sole proprietor who provides a service to a client or customer.” The rule does exclude “a franchisee in the context of a franchisee-franchisor relationship,” which would remain subject to federal antitrust laws. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZE6BCJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ZE6BCJ</a>]. Therefore, any restrictions imposed by brokers on licensed real estate salespersons who are W-2 employees, as well as those engaged as independent contractors, would come squarely under the new rule.</p>
<p><strong>A Non-Compete Clause is Now </strong><strong>Deemed Unfair Competition</strong></p>
<p>Under Section 910.2(a) of the new rule, “It is an unfair method of competition for an employer to enter into or attempt to enter into a non-compete clause with a worker; maintain with a worker a non-compete clause; or represent to a worker that the worker is subject to a non-compete clause where the employer has no good faith basis to believe that the worker is subject to an enforceable non-compete clause.” Any non-compete clause in an agreement with any worker, including an independent contractor, is now deemed illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Employers Obligations Regarding </strong><strong>Existing Non-Compete Clauses</strong></p>
<p>Under Section 901.2(b)(1) an employer would be required to rescind any existing non-compete clauses entered into with any worker. This is a major issue. Normally, when a new law or rule is promulgated, any existing agreements would be “grandfathered”, meaning that they would be allowed to remain in effect, and that the inclusion of a non-compete provision going forward would be subject to the new rule and, therefore, banned. The FTC’s proposed rule would be retroactive and amount to an ex post facto regulation. In effect, thousands of non-compete agreements that have been negotiated and included in valid and binding agreements would be invalidated overnight.</p>
<p>An employer must rescind the non-compete provision by the compliance date, which is defined as 180 days after the publication of the final rule by the FTC. Section 910.4 also provides that the new rule would supersede any “State statute, regulations, order, or interpretation” unless they afford a worker greater protection than the new rule. Basically, the laws of 47 states would become null and void when it comes to non-compete provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Rescission Notice Requirements of Employers</strong></p>
<p>Under Section 901.2(b)(2), when an employer rescinds an existing non-compete clause, the employer “must provide notice to the worker that the worker’s non-compete clause is no longer in effect and may not be enforced against the worker.” The employer must provide the notice to each worker specifically and the notice can be provided by paper correspondence or by email or text. The new rule further provides that “the employer must provide the notice to the worker within 45 days of rescinding the non-compete clause.” The notice provision also applies to any worker who previously worked for the employer and is subject to a non-compete provision, “provided that the employer has the worker’s contact information readily available.” The new rule provides model language for the required notice:</p>
<p>A new rule enforced by the Federal Trade Commission makes it unlawful for us to maintain a non-compete clause in your employment contract. As of [DATE 180 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE], the non-compete clause in your contract is no longer in effect. This means that once you stop working for [EMPLOYER NAME]:</p>
<p>You may seek or accept a job with any company or any person—even if they compete with [EMPLOYER NAME].<br />
You may run your own business—even if it competes with [EMPLOYER NAME].<br />
You may compete with [EMPLOYER NAME] at any time following your employment with [EMPLOYER NAME].<br />
The FTC’s new rule does not affect any other terms of your employment contract.</p>
<p><strong>Exception Permitted with Sale of a Business</strong></p>
<p>Section 910.3 provides an exception to this new rule and allows a non-compete to be entered into with a person or persons selling their business or is “otherwise disposing of all of the person’s ownership interest in the business entity, or by a person who is selling all or substantially all of a business entity’s operating assets.” The person must be a “substantial owner” which is defined as <em>an individual that owns or holds at least a 25% ownership interest in the selling business entity</em>. The rule further makes clear that any non-compete provisions covered under this exception would still be subject to federal antitrust law, as well as all other applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do We Go from Here?</strong></p>
<p>There is no doubt that there will be lawsuits filed seeking to invalidate the FTC’s new rule. Non-compete provisions have been used and upheld for years and the courts have always been very careful when upholding or invalidating these types of provisions. Employers, including real estate brokers, have utilized these non-compete provisions when it comes to key individuals and their departure. Departing “workers” could cause irreparable harm to a business or brokerage firm and employers need mechanisms to limit the potential economic harm that could be caused by “workers” who move to competitors. If non-compete clauses are no longer valid, business owners need to ensure that effective and carefully drafted non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreements are entered into with workers and, provided they are not overbroad, these alternatives will afford employers the tools necessary to protect their legitimate business interests.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><strong>Stone Soup</strong>—For those that haven’t heard this story, it’s about hungry travelers who say they are going to boil a big stone in a pot of water to make soup for everyone. While they say it’s delicious, they also say that it needs a little bit of garnish, which is missing, to improve the flavor. The townsfolk all provide a little bit of this, and a little bit of that. They add potatoes, onions, celery, tomatoes, corn, meat, milk, butter, salt and pepper. Finally, the stone is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by everyone. The moral of the story is that sharing benefits everyone who contributes. Today, I’m going to share information I’ve obtained from various sources over the past month to create my version of Stone Soup. Bon appétit.</p>
<p><strong>Lobby Day</strong></p>
<p>Lobby Day is our annual trip to Albany to meet with our legislators and impress upon them the issues that are important to our membership. This year, Lobby Day is scheduled for Tuesday, May 2, 2023, at the Empire State Plaza. We will gather in Meeting Room 6 (breakfast and lunch will be provided). Make sure that you register on the HGAR website (it’s free) and indicate if you wish to ride the free bus up to Albany.</p>
<p>There are two busses that will take members to Albany. One bus will leave at 5:50 a.m. from outside the HGAR offices on 110 Bloomingdale Rd., White Plains, and will stop at the DiCicco’s Market in Brewster at 6:30 a.m., before arriving in Albany. The other bus will depart at 5:50 a.m. from the former HGAR office in Nyack, located at 2 Medical Park Drive, and will stop at 6:30 a.m. at the rear of the Newburgh Mall, before continuing on to Albany. Both busses will depart Albany after lunch to return home.</p>
<p>Additional information and details for Lobby Day can be found at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/event/lobby-day-in-albany-20230502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/event/lobby-day-in-albany-20230502</a>: or you can contact HGAR Government Affairs Director Alexander Roithmayr at<a href="mailto:Alexander.Roithmayr@HGAR.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Alexander.Roithmayr@HGAR.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to the governor’s Executive Order, cold calling is still not permitted. This includes any unsolicited calls or texts to any person or business with whom you do not already have an established business relationship.</p>
<p><strong>New Protected Classes</strong></p>
<p>Previously, New York State’s Department of Human Rights expanded the Human Rights Law to identify status as a victim of domestic violence as a protected class for discrimination purposes. Recently, the DHR added citizenship and immigration status as a protected class as well. While the DHR has always been of the opinion that immigration status/citizenship was protected under “national origin” and possibly under race, creed, and color as well, it felt it necessary to specifically identify this class. Further, it changed several terms, with “alien” being changed to “noncitizen” and “illegal alien” being changed to “undocumented noncitizen.”</p>
<p><strong>Flood Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Effective June 21, 2023, every residential lease will be required to provide notice of the following information related to the previous flood history and current flood risk of a leased premises:</p>
<p>• whether any or all of the leased premises is located wholly or partially in a Federal Emergency Management Agency designated floodplain;</p>
<p>• whether any or all of the leased premises is located wholly or partially in the Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain) according to FEMA’s current Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the leased premises’ area;</p>
<p>• whether any or all of the leased premises is located wholly or partially in a Moderate Risk Flood Hazard Area (500-year floodplain) according to FEMA’s current Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the leased premises’ area; and</p>
<p>• whether the leased premises has experienced any flood damage due to a natural flood event, such as heavy rainfall, coastal storm surge, tidal inundation, or river overflow.</p>
<p>Further, every residential lease must contain the following notice to tenants: “Flood insurance is available to renters through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Flood Insurance Program to cover your personal property and contents in the event of a flood. A standard renter’s insurance policy does not typically cover flood damage. You are encouraged to examine your policy to determine whether you are covered.”</p>
<p><strong>Mold Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Effective June 14, 2023, the language in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement form will change; therefore, it’s important that you advise/update these forms. The change is with regard to the issue of mold. The new form will now contain language that will encompass mold (using the language “other material” when referencing toxic or hazardous substances, as well as the phrase “and indoor mold,” which specifically identifies mold). Additionally, the new PCDS form will ask the following question:</p>
<p>“HAS THE PROPERTY BEEN TESTED FOR INDOOR MOLD? YES/NO/UNKN (IF YES, ATTACH A COPY OF THE REPORT).”</p>
<p>New PCDS forms will be made available by the DOS and must be used starting June 14, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Agency Disclosure in Different Languages</strong></p>
<p>New York State now requires that state agencies provide documents translated into seven different languages. These are: English, Spanish, Haitian-Creole, Italian, Korean, Russian and Chinese. As a result, the Department of State now provides agency disclosure forms in these languages. If a consumer is not proficient in reading and/or understanding English and the agency disclosure form is provided in a language they are proficient in, the licensee should provide the form with that language. Note: failure to provide a translated form in a language the consumer understands may expose the licensee to potential liability.</p>
<p><strong>End of Real Estate License Reciprocity</strong></p>
<p>Due to New York State’s increased requirements for obtaining a real estate license, including the required hours to obtain your license, fair housing training requirements, and the recent requirements that all real estate licensees must satisfy implicit bias and cultural competency programs, the DOS had terminated any reciprocity relationships it had previously maintained with other states. This means that licensees from other states may not waive into New York State to obtain a real estate license. Due to this termination of reciprocity, a member should check with formerly-reciprocal states to determine if they are continuing to observe reciprocity from New York State to its jurisdiction if they are considering obtaining a license in that jurisdiction. DOS has indicated that they are looking at future ways to reopen reciprocity.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this Stone Soup. As the saying goes, “sharing is caring,” so please share this information with others, particularly your colleagues and clients, and fill their minds with sustenance.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Commercial brokerage firm CBRE announced on March 14 that the headquarters building for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors has been sold to Hines U.S. Property Partners.</p>
<p>Hines U.S. Property Partners is the flagship commingled U.S. core plus fund for Hines, which is headquartered in Houston. No financial terms of the transaction were disclosed by CBRE in the sale of the 262,000-square-foot mixed-use, grocery-anchored property. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that Hines U.S. Property Partners acquired The Source for $110 million from UBS Realty Investors, LLC. In 2005, Bloomingdale Road Investors LLC, an entity controlled by UBS Realty Investors LLC, acquired The Source for $153 million. R Squared LLC of New York City, which built the shopping center for $96 million, was the seller.</p>
<p>The CBRE team of Jeffrey Dunne, David Gavin, Steve Bardsley and Travis Langer represented the seller and procured the buyer. The Source is 99% occupied and features anchor tenants Whole Foods, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Raymour &amp; Flanigan, The Cheesecake Factory, and White Plains’ new location for the DMV. Danone also leases the top floor of the property on a long-term basis for its US Headquarters, along with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>CBRE’s Dunne said, “The offering represented a unique opportunity to purchase a Whole Foods-anchored center offering highly stable income and no near-term rollover. Whole Foods and Dicks’ recent renewals further affirm the property’s strong position within the market.”</p>
<p>CBRE’s Gavin added, “We continue to see strong demand for properties like The Source, which provide long-term cash flow and an attractive rent roll in infill, high demographic markets.”</p>
<p>Located off Exit 8 of I-287 (103,293 cars per day) at the corner of Maple Avenue and Bloomingdale Road (22,759 cars per day), the center is located in White Plains’ bustling CBD which includes more than 24,000 housing units and millions of square feet of office space.</p>
<p>CBRE officials noted that White Plains has experienced a significant increase in population recently, with more than 7,500 apartments having been recently delivered, under construction or proposed. The strength of the property is further highlighted by a population of 101,000 within three miles, increasing to more than 212,000 within five miles and an average household incomes of more than $190,000.</p>
<p>CBRE’s Metro NY National Retail Partners Team is currently marketing for sale: Stop &amp; Shop and Chase Bank at Somers Commons, a 73,000- square-foot center in Somers; Majestic Corners, a 113,000-square-foot grocery anchored center in Shirley (Long Island); ShopRite at Greenport Towne Center, a net leased ShopRite center in Hudson, NY and a net leased Applebee’s and TD Bank in Phillipsburg, NJ.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>SANTA CLARA, CA—While any astute real estate professional will tell you it&#8217;s nearly impossible to time the real estate market, there is one week that is most likely to get home sellers the best possible outcome, according to Realtor.com. Nationally, homeowners who list the week of April 16-22, 2023 will hit the sweet spot in terms of the best combination of higher prices, fewer homes to compete against, faster sales time and strong buyer demand.</p>
<p>A survey released on March 15 from Realtor.com and HarrisX found that 60% of home sellers took up to three months to get their home ready to list, so for homeowners who have been making preparations, listing during that crucial April week could get $48,000 more for their home than they would have at the start of the year.</p>
<p>“Many home shoppers kick off their search in the early spring and they often beat the majority of home sellers to the punch,” said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. “For this reason, sellers who list on the earlier side will get more buyer attention and therefore be more likely to sell quickly and for a higher price.”</p>
<p><strong>Why is April 16-22 the Best Time to Sell?</strong></p>
<p>While mortgage rates are expected to remain elevated through 2023, for-sale inventory is still well below pre-pandemic levels, so sellers can still expect well-priced homes to be in high demand. Those looking to take advantage of seasonal market trends should consider getting ready to list April 16-22, which is anticipated to have the best mix of market conditions for sellers, including:</p>
<p><strong>Higher prices</strong>—Homes listed during this week have historically had prices 2.1% higher than the average week throughout the year, and are typically 12.1% higher than the start of the year. If 2023 follows the typical seasonal trend, the national median listing price could reach $8,400 higher than the average week, and $48,000 more than the start of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Strong buyer demand</strong>—The more buyers looking at a home, the better, as the home is likely to get more offers and sell quickly. Historically, this week garnered 16.4% more views per listing than the typical week, but in 2022 this week got 32.5% more views per listing than the average week, as buyer demand dropped in the latter part of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-selling homes</strong>—Thanks to above-average demand, homes tend to sell more quickly during this week. Historically, homes actively for sale during this week sold 18.0% faster than the average week. In the fast-moving 2022 market, this week saw homes typically on the market for 32 days, 13 days faster than the year&#8217;s average, and 37 days faster than was typical in 2019. The 2023 market is not expected to move as quickly as in 2022, but the best week is still expected to see faster sales than the year&#8217;s typical pace.</p>
<p><strong>Less competition from other sellers</strong>—Typically, there would be 9.3% fewer sellers on the market during this week compared to the average week throughout the year. Last year saw significant inventory gains as buyer demand cooled, but sellers responded by pulling back on listings by the end of the year. Active inventory was 65.5% higher at the start of 2023 versus 2022, but still 43.2% lower than pre-pandemic levels. This gap means there continues to be opportunities for sellers who enter the market this spring.</p>
<p><strong>Tips on Prepping a Home for Sale</strong></p>
<p>According to Realtor.com&#8217;s survey, it took most recent sellers (80%) between two weeks and six months to prepare their home for sale, with the sweet spot being between one-to-three-months (32%). For most (56%) it took more time than expected to list their home, while 23% said it was faster than expected and 22% said it took about as long as they expected. For those considering a home sale this year, it&#8217;s best to start preparing now in case it takes longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>For the best chance at a quick sale and high price, homeowners should make sure that their home looks its best, has been well cared for and is up-to-date with routine maintenance. To get ready to list, about a third of recent sellers (35%) made repairs/updates to the home, did some cleaning and decluttering (33%) and found an agent to help them (31%). In order to best market their home, owners and their agents had listing photos taken (34%); created marketing materials such as flyers (27%); created a 3D/virtual tour (20%) and staged the home (11%).</p>
<p>Making minor repairs can go a long way during a showing. Potentially, a buyer who sees leaky faucets and closet doors that don&#8217;t close might become concerned about larger potential problems with the home. The most common repairs made by survey respondents were:</p>
<p>• Minor cosmetic updates such as replacing light fixtures or faucets (16%)</p>
<p>• Carpet/floor replacement or refinishing (14%)</p>
<p>• Landscaping such as mulch, vegetation, etc. (13%)</p>
<p>• Full painting of exterior (12%)</p>

<p>• Replacing the roof (9%)</p>
<p>• Replacing major systems such as HVAC, hot water (8%)</p>
<p>• Caulking (6%)</p>
<p>• Replacing grout (6%)</p>
<p>“In today&#8217;s market, it&#8217;s really important to price your home well and make sure that it looks its best in order to get top dollar and find a buyer quickly,” said Hannah Jones, economic research analyst Realtor.com. “There are still buyers in the market, but due to high prices and interest rates, they&#8217;re being a bit more picky than they were the past several years.”</p>
<p>The survey was conducted online from Feb. 3-10, 2023, among 2,286 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of this poll is +/- 2.1 percentage points and larger for subgroups. The results reflect a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Results were weighted for age by gender, region, race/ethnicity, and income where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—As negotiations continue at the State Capital on the 2023-2024 New York State Budget, Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislative leaders agree that the state is facing a housing crisis. The issue seems to be how to go about solving it, through offering carrots in the form of incentives to spark new affordable housing construction or imposing the threat of a stick if municipalities fail to meet mandated housing development targets.</p>
<p>Just how the state intends to deal with a housing shortage and the high cost of housing will become clearer in the coming days as the governor and legislative leaders look to finalize a budget by the April 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul in her State of the State address in January unveiled her ambitious, yet controversial “New York Housing Compact,” which looks to catalyze housing development and has a goal of creating 800,000 new units in the next decade. The governor said the state would provide assistance to localities to meet the housing goal by offering $250 million in funding for infrastructure like schools, roads, and sewers needed to support growing communities.”</p>
<p>Under the compact, every single locality across the state will have a target for building new homes, Upstate, the target is for the current housing stock to grow by 1% every three years. Downstate, 3% every three years. She added that as part of the compact, any municipality with a train station should rezone the area within a half-mile of the station to allow for the creation of new housing within the next three years. Gov. Hochul also proposed an extension of the 421a tax exemption in New York City through 2030.</p>
<p>Other key facets of the governor’s New York Housing Compact are: $20 million for planning and technical assistance to support local rezoning efforts and other solutions to drive growth; $15 million for a new statewide data collection effort; $4 million to create a new Housing Planning Office within Homes and Community Renewal to support localities in meeting their housing goals and coordinate planning efforts across the state; $39.8 million to reduce the risk of lead exposure in rental properties outside of New York City, including $20 million in assistance to property owners for building remediation, and $50 million for the creation of a statewide Homeowner Stabilization Fund to provide critical home repairs in 10 key communities with a high concentration of low-income homeowners of color.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, her plan has been praised by many business and construction trades organizations, but has been criticized by a host of suburban municipal officials from the Hudson Valley and Long Island over state government’s infringement on ‘home rule” and local zoning regulations.</p>
<p>On March 14, the New York State Senate and Assembly released their respective “One House” budgets in response to the governor’s proposed budget. Both the Senate and Assembly rejected key provisions of the New York Housing Compact, particularly the mandates and development targets and instead offered proposals to provide incentives for housing development, without penalties. The proposals by the Assembly and the Senate would allocate $500 million to help municipalities create a housing plan and help pay for its implementation. However, the Assembly and Senate rejected the idea of extending the 421a deadline.</p>
<p>“I think we all agree that we must build more housing. We definitely need affordable housing. So, I’m sure that will be a broad conversation,” Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said on Spectrum News’ “Capital Tonight” broadcast earlier this month.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping that we can figure out a way to move the housing situation, that obviously has to be addressed, forward in the budget, but if it can’t be moved in the budget, then it will be moved outside of the budget,” Sen. Stewart-Cousins added. “This is a very, very big conversation to have in a compacted amount of time.”</p>

Kathy Hochul; Joe Kenner, CEO and President of non-profit Greyston of Yonkers; and John Levy, CEO, of chip maker SEEQC, Inc, Elmsford.</p></div>
<p>Gov. Hochul visited the headquarters of The Business Council of Westchester in Rye Brook on March 15 to continue her push for her New York Housing Compact and its key provisions.</p>
<p>At the event, Peter Herero, Jr. president of New York Hospitality Group of White Plains; John Levy, CEO, of chip maker SEEQC, Inc. of Elmsford; and Joe Kenner, CEO and President of non-profit Greyston of Yonkers, discussed how the lack of affordable housing was impacting their operations. Herero said that the biggest obstacle for growth for many businesses is finding suitable housing for its workforce.</p>
<p>“As a fast-growing chip manufacturing company, we know that housing that is affordable, convenient to our foundry and nearby to public transportation is critical to our ability to recruit and retain our employees over the long term,” Levy said. “Governor Hochul&#8217;s New York Housing Compact addresses these critical needs and will enable us to meet the growing demands of our quantum chip business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greyston’s Kenner added, &#8220;I applaud Gov. Kathy Hochul&#8217;s efforts to tackle the state&#8217;s housing challenges. Housing is a fundamental need that impacts an individual&#8217;s ability to get to the next level, like finding employment and keeping that job. Many of our Open Hire staff indicated housing as a significant obstacle to securing and maintaining a stable job. By making housing more accessible and affordable, this initiative can help our team members meet their basic needs, focus on their work, and contribute to the growth of our state&#8217;s economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 100 business and non-profit organizations throughout New York State have come out in support of Gov. Hochul’s New York Housing Compact, including both The Business Council of Westchester, The County Association and others.</p>
<p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica agrees that the state is facing a housing crisis involving both supply and cost. “New York State has an affordable housing crisis and that crisis will not be solved with this budget. The governor, the legislature, local municipalities, and all interested parties, including the real estate industry, must come together to study and understand the root causes of our housing crisis and to collaborate in finding long term solutions,” he said. “New Yorkers across the state are entitled to a thoughtful and deliberative process that engages all communities and all affected parties in helping to find long term solutions. Until such time, our elected officials should work together to adopt common sense measures that we all can agree upon.”</p>
<p>Leah Caro, co-chair of HGAR’s Legislative Committee, attended the governor’s event in Rye Brook and believes that negotiation between the governor and legislative leaders can produce a plan that will address the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Caro, who is President and Principal Broker of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville, said, “The Governor and the guest speakers offered compelling stories regarding the lack of available and affordable housing in New York, particularly in regard to hiring talent for our county&#8217;s growing industries; business leaders looking to increase their workforce, from executives and scientists to restaurant workers, find that many viable candidates just can&#8217;t find somewhere nearby to live. While we applaud the concept of increasing our housing stock, what the final product looks like remains to be seen. Clearly, a co-operative effort between local municipalities, the State Legislature and the governor&#8217;s office will need to be mapped out, and we look forward to supporting those efforts.”</p>
<div id="attachment_44023" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44023" class="wp-image-44023" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/JVP_0124.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-44023" class="wp-caption-text">More than 100 business and non-profit organizations throughout New York State have come out in support of Gov. Hochul’s New York Housing Compact, including both The Business Council of Westchester, The County Association and others.</p></div>
<p>Gov. Hochul said that she is hopeful that state legislative leaders will have “open minds” in trying to hammer out a housing plan. The governor told reporters after the Business Council program ended, “Change is necessary. We cannot continue the way we have. We are losing people to Connecticut and New Jersey… and the reason is the lack of affordable housing or housing at any (income) level and we have to stop that right now.”</p>
<p>When asked by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> what she would say to those government officials that say her plan flies in the face of home rule and takes away local planning control, Gov. Hochul responded, “That is not the case at all. We are simply saying that sometimes it is hard to grow. You get some people in parts of your community who don’t want to see your community prosper and this gives you a tool to be able to say ‘This is what we are going to do because we are part of a statewide solution.’”</p>
<p>She added that for 80% of the municipalities in New York State, the compact target would involve the addition of only 100 units or less and if affordable, the target number would drop to 50.</p>
<p>A host of local business leaders expressed support for the governor’s plan, including Business Council of Westchester President and CEO Dr. Marsha Gordon, who said, “Westchester County and New York State residents suffer from a chronic and growing shortage of workforce housing. Employers cannot compete to attract and retain talent for their workforce without attractive housing opportunities available to its prospective employees. This housing crisis threatens our economic future. The Business Council of Westchester commends Governor Hochul for her strong leadership in addressing this critical issue. The New York Housing Compact directly confronts this crisis unlike any of the past plans of her predecessors. The BCW recognizes that fundamental change can be difficult to implement. We commend the governor for reaching out to business, labor, not-for-profit, and faith-based organizations in her effort to create desperately needed housing in our communities.”</p>
<p>Michael Romita, President and CEO of the Westchester County Association said, “New York&#8217;s housing crisis continues to be a serious impediment to economic growth and community vitality. It is harming our residents, workers, and businesses. The major culprit is an antiquated patchwork of local land use and zoning restrictions. This has placed New York at a competitive disadvantage to our neighboring states who have taken steps to modernize their laws. The governor&#8217;s Housing Compact is a bold step and has the support of businesses, nonprofits, and housing advocacy groups from across the state. We at the Westchester County Association call on the legislature to work with the governor to pass housing reform by addressing the issue head-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Foley, CEO of The Building and Realty Institute of Westchester said, “It has simply been too easy for too long to avoid building the housing we need. In Westchester, our housing shortage comes with real costs, and those costs are borne by seniors, millennials, people of color, middle-class families, and others who struggle with rising rents and dwindling affordable home ownership options. The governor&#8217;s New York Compact plan is a bold solution that at its essence makes it clear that this is a shared problem and requires a shared response. Every community does not need to do the same things to address our housing shortage, but no community should be allowed to do nothing.”</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer said, “We agree with the governor that we need to provide more housing units in Westchester as part of the overall statewide need. Our task is to work closely with our local governments, using the tools available, to achieve these goals.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Her background in real estate as she tells it almost began by happenstance, but her hard work has led her to found her own New York City-based real estate development firm—MAG Partners—in 2020 that in a short time has built a $1-billion pipeline.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> pondered who would be the candidate for the Five Questions feature for Women’s Month, the logical choice was MaryAnne Gilmartin.</p>
<p>Her background in real estate as she tells it almost began by happenstance, but her hard work has led her to found her own New York City-based real estate development firm—MAG Partners—in 2020 that in a short time has built a $1-billion pipeline.</p>
<p>The Fordham University graduate (undergraduate and graduate degree) began her career with the New York City Public Development Agency (the predecessor to the New York City Economic Development Corp.) and since then has held chief executive positions with some of the country’s leading development firms, including Forest City Ratner and Mack-Cali Realty Corp. She has overseen a host of high-profile projects and has been frank about who has guided her and now pays it forward and mentors others in their real estate careers.</p>
<p>Gilmartin, who serves as a special advisor to Fordham Real Estate Institute’s Executive Advisory Council, recently said at a “She Builds” session held at the university’s Lincoln Center campus, “I’ve built my career trying to bump up against what people think of as a developer and identify more with ‘placemaker.’ If I use the word ‘developer,’ I refer to myself as a ‘civic developer’ because what we do is contribute to civic life and with that comes a great responsibility. I’d love the word developer to mean all that I know that it is, which is a person who creates place, changes the skyline and the ground plane in cities, and builds something of lasting quality that impacts the lives of the community in which it exists.”</p>
<p>Gilmartin served as President and CEO of Forest City Ratner Companies, where she oversaw a host of game-changing ground-up developments and managed its multimillion square foot residential, commercial and retail portfolio. She also served as Chair of the Board of Directors and interim Chief Executive Officer of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.</p>
<p>In her tenure at Forest City Ratner Companies, she spearheaded the development of some of the most high-profile real estate projects in New York City. She led the efforts to build Barclays Center, the state-of-the-art sports and entertainment venue and the centerpiece of the $4.9 billion, 22-acre mixed-use Pacific Park Brooklyn development.</p>
<p>She also oversaw the development of The New York Times Building, designed by world-renowned architect Renzo Piano; New York by Gehry, designed by award-winning architect Frank Gehry; and the Tata Innovation Center at Cornell Tech, a new office building that is a first-of-its-kind space for tech innovation, designed by Weiss/Manfredi on Roosevelt Island. During her tenure at Forest City, the firm also developed Ridge Hill in Yonkers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-44075" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MaryAnnesquare-300x300@2x.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" />Today, MAG Partners is developing a number of distinctive projects, including 281 West 28th Street, a mixed-income residential building designed by COOKFOX that will begin leasing in early 2023. In addition, the company is developing two other residential buildings and a boutique office building in Hudson Square. In partnership with Sagamore Ventures, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and MacFarlane Partners, MAG Partners is leading the development of Baltimore Peninsula, a 235-acre masterplan in Baltimore, MD. In 2023, 1.1 million square feet of office, retail and residential development will open on a prime waterfront location.</p>
<p>Gilmartin is a civic leader in the New York metropolitan area, serving as Chair Emeritus of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a member of the Board of Trustees of The Brooklyn Academy of Music, a member of the New York Public Radio Board of Trustees, and a member of the Executive Committee and Board of Governors of The Real Estate Board of New York. At Columbia University, she is part of the Industry Advisory Board of the MS Real Estate Development Program as well as a member of the real estate advisory board in the Center for AI in Business Analytics &amp; FinTech. In addition to her civic and industry board service, she was appointed a member of the board of directors of the global investment banking firm Jefferies Group LLC in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Your background in real estate is very impressive, rising to president and CEO of Forest City Ratner Companies, serving as chairman and interim CEO of Mack-Cali Realty during a tense shareholder battle and founding your own real estate development company MAG Partners three years ago. Can you tell us what led you into the industry and what have been your keys to success in what has been a male-dominated industry?</p>
<p><strong>Gilmartin:</strong> I call myself an accidental developer because this career path relied on serendipity. I had no inkling of what I wanted to be when I grew up, but coming out of university, I landed an Urban Fellow fellowship. I was assigned to New York City’s Public Development Agency, which is now the Economic Development Corporation. My plan was to spend a summer with them, and then go off to law school in September and fight for the rights of juveniles in the justice system.</p>
<p>At the Public Development Agency, I discovered that I had real estate development in my veins. At the time, leadership at PDC would challenge the team by saying, “Let’s look at the West Side, what should we do with it?” It was an incredible place to start a career and my path to meeting Bruce Ratner with whom I would work for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>My career grew in a meritocracy. Bruce always chose the best man or the best woman for the job. So, I always made sure to know the most, be the most prepared and worked the hardest. I never had my eye on the corner office, but it turns out, in a meritocracy, if you prove yourself, you can get the top job.</p>
<p>After serving as CEO at Forest City Ratner, I set out to build a company that looks a little more like the community for which we build, MAG Partners. This of course is a very simple statement, but I clearly have been a little bit of an anomaly in the business in a way that I wish I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Were there people who were your mentors and/or helped you along the way in your career. If so, please explain?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-44074" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fodham-She-Builds--e1679419428201.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="289" />Gilmartin:</strong> Mentoring has played an outsized role in my professional evolution. The role of mentor or mentee is critical to the career development of the women in our field, and I take my own responsibility seriously when I meet young women who want to get into the industry. My two most influential mentors have been Bruce Ratner and Mary Ann Tighe (CBRE). With both in my corner, I hit the career lottery. Because of the profound impact mentoring has had on my career, I have vowed to always be a mentor to others in order to pay it forward.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What would you say were the obstacles you faced and women still must overcome in the commercial development arena and what advice do you have for women in commercial real estate?</p>
<p><strong>Gilmartin:</strong> While I have said many times before that I never got that email that said, “you’re a woman so you should feel really intimidated” in this industry. But again, that is because I was part of a meritocracy and it was always the best man or woman for the job with Bruce Ratner. My advice is to be the most prepared and to not be afraid to show off your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> You recently began leasing MAG Partners’ first project—Ruby—a 480-unit residential project at 243 West 28th St. in Chelsea. In a short time, MAG Partners has built an impressive pipeline with projects planned at 335 Eighth Avenue, 300 East 50th St.; 122 Varick St. in the Hudson Square District; 44-02 Vernon Blvd. in Long Island City, as well as MAG Partners’ participation in the 1.1-million-square-foot Baltimore Peninsula Project. From what I understand, all of your New York City projects qualified for the now expired 421a tax incentive. Will the lack of 421a inhibit development in New York City in years to come if not reinstated in some form?</p>
<p><strong>Gilmartin:</strong> Absolutely. But in the more near term, we are extremely focused on an extension to the deadline to complete these projects, something Governor Hochul put forward in her budget. This deadline is not just important to my company and the projects we have moving—the danger of missing the 2026 deadline is putting 33,000+ units in jeopardy of not moving forward. With the current challenges in the markets, it is critical that the legislature extend the deadline for vested projects.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Does MAG Partners have any plans to enter other markets in the New York City metro area, specifically the lower Hudson Valley?</p>
<p><strong>Gilmartin:</strong> The great thing about being a private company is that we can be opportunistic. We want to be rational and strategic, and we are not confined to New York City.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The share of baby boomers has surpassed millennials and now makes up the largest generation of home buyers, according to the latest study from the National Association of Realtors released on March 28.</p>
<p>The 2023 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends report, which examines the similarities and differences of recent home buyers and sellers across generations, found that the combined share of younger boomer (58 to 67 years old) and older boomer buyers (68 to 76 years old) rose to 39% in 2022, up from 29% the year prior. Younger millennials (24 to 32 years old) and older millennials (33 to 42 years old) have been the top group of buyers since 2014, but they saw their combined share fall from 43% in 2021 to 28% last year.</p>
<p>“Baby boomers have the upper hand in the homebuying market,” said Dr. Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “The majority of them are repeat buyers who have housing equity to propel them into their dream home—be it a place to enjoy retirement or a home near friends and family. They are living healthier and longer and making housing trades later in life.”</p>
<p>Twenty-six percent of all buyers were first-time buyers, the lowest since NAR began tracking the data and a decrease from 34% last year. Seventy percent of younger millennials and 46% of older millennials were first-time buyers. Behind these groups, only 21% of Generation X (43 to 57 years old) and 9% of younger boomers were first-time purchasers.</p>
<p>Generation Z—ages 18 to 23—now makes up 4% of home buyers, a slight increase from 2% in 2021. Nearly one in three Gen Z buyers—30%—moved directly from a family member’s home into homeownership. Finding a location convenient to friends and family was most important to this cohort of buyers.</p>
<p>“As the youngest generation of home buyers and sellers, it’s encouraging to see Gen Z entering the market,” Lautz said. “Their desire for homeownership is strong, and many are relying on family support systems to help make their first real estate purchase.”</p>
<p>Generation X made up 24% of total buyers. They had the highest median household income of any generation ($114,300), followed by older millennials ($102,900).</p>
<p>In addition to leading the way in home buying, baby boomers remained the largest home seller generation, jumping from 42% in 2021 to 52% in 2022. Among all generations, sellers typically remained in their home for 10 years before selling, up from nine years last year. On average, younger millennials stayed in their homes for four years, while older boomers sold their homes after 16 years.</p>
<p>All generations agreed that the most common reason to sell was to be closer to friends and family. Older generations were also more likely to sell due to retirement, while younger generations cited the desire for a larger home and job relocation as top reasons to sell their home.</p>
<div id="attachment_44108" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44108" class="wp-image-44108" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NAR-HOMEBUYERS-STUDY-CHART.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-44108" class="wp-caption-text">Source: 2023 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends Report</p>

<p>On average, people are moving farther distances. Overall, buyers moved a median of 50 miles when relocating, the highest ever recorded and up significantly from 15 miles last year. Younger generations moved shorter distances, with younger and older millennials each typically moving 15 miles away. Younger boomers moved the furthest (90 miles), followed by older boomers (60 miles) and the silent generation (50 miles).</p>
<p>Overall, buyers expected to live in their homes for 15 years, up from 12 years in 2021. For younger millennials, the expected duration was only 10 years, compared to 20 years for younger and older boomers. Surprisingly, Generation Z expected to remain in their newly purchased home for 19 years.</p>
<p>Eighty-six percent of all buyers purchased their homes through a real estate agent. This number was highest among younger boomers (90%) and Generation X (88%). Buyers from all generations agreed about the top reasons for using an agent: they wanted help finding the right home to purchase (49%), negotiating the terms of sale (13%) and negotiating the price (11%). Younger (14%) and older (12%) millennials were most likely to want their agent to help with paperwork.</p>
<p>Eighty-eight percent of all buyers reported that they view a home purchase as a good investment. Seventy-four percent of younger millennials and 77% of older millennials viewed a home as better than or about as good a financial investment as stocks.</p>
<p>Seventy-six percent of buyers said that they would use their agent again or recommend their agent to others, a number that was consistent across all generations.</p>
<p>“Owning a home is more than just a financial investment. It’s a symbol of stability, independence and community that helps people build their lives and achieve their dreams,” said NAR President Kenny Parcell, a Realtor® from Spanish Fork, UT, and broker-owner of Equity Real Estate Utah. “Whether you’re a first-time home buyer or an experienced investor, Realtors have the expertise and knowledge needed to provide valuable advice and help you make informed decisions about your purchase.”</p>
<p>NAR mailed a 129-question survey in July 2022 using a random sample weighted to be representative of sales on a geographic basis to 153,045 recent home buyers. Buyers had to have purchased a primary residence home between July 2021 and June 2022. A total of 4,854 responses were received from primary residence buyers. After accounting for undeliverable questionnaires, the survey had an adjusted response rate of 3.2%.</p>
<p>All information in this profile is characteristic of the 12-month period ending June 2022, with the exception of income data, which are reported for 2021. In some sections, comparisons are also given for results obtained in previous surveys. Not all results are directly comparable due to changes in questionnaire design and sample size.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The chief executives of five major business organizations in Westchester County, including the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, have jointly sent a letter to the Westchester State Delegation urging them that incentives alone will not solve the housing crisis in Westchester County and therefore lawmakers should enact some key facets of Gov. Kathy Hochul’s “New York Housing Compact” plan.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by: Jana Currier, Interim CEO and COO, Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors; John T. Cooney Jr., Executive Director, Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc.; Jan Fisher, Executive Director, Nonprofit Westchester; Tim Foley, CEO, Building and Realty Institute of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region; and Michael N. Romita, President and CEO, Westchester County Association.</p>
<p>Noting the recently released one-house budget proposals by the Assembly and Senate offer incentives to foster needed housing development and an increase in infrastructure spending as compared to Gov. Hochul’s plan, the business groups noted in the letter: “We have consistently advocated for setting clear housing growth targets (including transit-oriented development) coupled with consequences for not meeting those targets. Incentives alone will not succeed.” Gov. Hochul’s plan sets targets for housing development and consequences for failure to meet those targets.</p>
<p>The letter also cited Westchester’s historic battle with the federal government over fair housing and noted that “even with court appointed supervision, repeated intervention in favor of local projects, and $70 million of additional county spending, it took 15 years to build 750 additional units of housing—far short of the 11,700 units deemed needed by the county’s most recent housing needs assessment.”</p>
<p>The business groups concluded by stating: “Additional support for infrastructure is welcome, as is flexibility for communities to decide how best to meet their housing goals. However, incentives alone (including the withholding of financial support), without clear growth targets coupled with consequences and enforcement for noncompliance, will bring no change in high-income, historically exclusionary suburbs such as Westchester where more housing opportunities are needed most.”</p>
<p>Housing reform is just one of a number of legislative priorities that will be presented to New York State lawmakers by HGAR members at the New York State Association of Realtors’ annual Lobby Day on May 2 in Albany.</p>
<p>HGAR will have two busses to take members to and from Albany. One bus will leave at 5:50 a.m. from outside the HGAR offices at 110 Bloomingdale Rd., White Plains, and will stop at the DeCicco’s Market in Brewster at 6:30 a.m., before arriving in Albany. The other bus will depart at 5:50 a.m. from the former HGAR office in Nyack, located at 2 Medical Park Drive, and will stop at 6:30 a.m. at the rear of the Newburgh Mall, before continuing to Albany. Both busses will depart Albany after lunch to return home.</p>
<p>According to HGAR Director of Government Affairs Alexander Roithmayr, the HGAR Legislative Committee outlined its legislative goals for this year.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR is in Opposition to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>• (S.305-Salazar</strong>) HGAR opposes the imposition of a statewide “good cause” eviction standard, which would implement impractical and overly restrictive standards and stifle investment in rental housing.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2783-Brisport) </strong>HGAR opposes the prohibition of landlords and landlords’ agents from collecting broker fees from a tenant.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2352-Kavanagh)</strong> HGAR opposes the requirement on real estate brokers and salespersons to request, compile and disclose personal demographic data on prospective home purchasers, including full name, race, ethnicity and gender, among other information.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2505-Kavanagh)</strong> The New York State Association of Realtors opposes the creation of a statewide residential rental registry and public online searchable database that would require owners of residential rental dwellings, housing two or more families living independently of each other, to register their property annually for a fee to be determined by the Department of State.</p>
<p><strong>• (S.221-Myrie)</strong> HGAR opposes the establishment of the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would provide tenant organizations the first opportunity to purchase rental properties prior to being put on the market, impose price stabilization provisions on the property for up to 99 years, cap annual rent increases and prohibit the eviction of any TOPA buyer except for “good cause.”</p>
<p><strong>• (S.2353-Kavanagh)</strong> HGAR opposes the requirement of property owners to conduct lead paint tests and provide reports of such tests prior to the selling or leasing of a property.</p>
<p>• HGAR opposes regulatory efforts by the Department of State to impose any new cease and desist zone on real estate licensees.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Supports:</strong></p>
<p>Measures to Expand Access to Homeownership</p>
<p>• HGAR supports enacting a first-time homebuyer savings account program to assist New Yorkers in saving for a first home within the state (bill introduction pending).</p>
<p>• HGAR supports expanding affordable and workforce housing development through the implementation of new zoning and tax incentives and easing restrictions on the conversion of existing commercial spaces into residential housing.</p>
<p>• HGAR supports directing funding in the New York State budget to expand broadband access throughout the state, particularly in rural regions.</p>
<p>Combating Discrimination in Cooperative Housing</p>
<p>• <strong>(A.1778-Lavine) (A.2685-Walker)</strong> HGAR supports ensuring fairness and transparency in the cooperative housing purchase process by establishing a clear timeline for the response to applicants by co-op boards and requiring a reason for any denial of an application in order to help combat illegal discrimination.</p>
<p>• <strong>(S.412-Thomas)</strong> HGAR supports a technical amendment to a law passed in 2019 placing restrictions on legitimate telemarketing business services provided by licensed professionals, stipulating the ability to provide telemarketing services during states of emergency.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>All New York state real estate Salespersons or Associate Brokers must place their licenses with a brokerage in order to conduct business. While you may not be an employee, the brokerage is required to monitor and supervise your activities. If a licensee violates the Department of State (DOS) rules and regulations relating to real estate activities, not only may the licensee be fined or have their license suspended or revoked, but the broker may be subject to the same thing. Holding someone’s license is a very serious matter. Therefore, it’s important that everyone understands the ins and outs of keeping your license with a brokerage and what you and your broker’s duties and responsibilities are related to that license.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA)</strong></p>
<p>An Independent Contractor Agreement is a document that binds both the broker and licensee in a working relationship. In most cases, you are not an employee, but you have access to materials and the office and you act on behalf of the broker as an independent contractor. In some cases, you have the ability to bind the brokerage. For instance, some licensees have the ability to sign up listings for the brokerage without having the broker actually sign the listing agreement. In other cases, the licensee may be authorized to accept less money as commission at the closing table in the event that something goes awry and the agents need to contribute some money to make the parties amenable and close the deal.</p>
<p>What’s most important about an ICA is that it establishes the foundations of your relationship with your broker and it should set forth your commission split in writing. Further, your ICA should set forth your commissions in the event that you leave the brokerage and you have deals in play. If you leave and you still have a deal that will close after you depart, are you entitled to the same commission? Less commission? No commission? It all depends on your ICA, so you need to look at it and have a discussion with your broker; particularly if you are considering leaving, either now or sometime in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Parting Ways with Your Brokerage</strong></p>
<p>Your ICA agreement should set forth what will happen if you decide to terminate your relationship with your brokerage. Things such as returning supplies, keys, name tags, access to computers, signage, etc. will be covered in your agreement. Once you terminate your relationship, you must make efforts to ensure that any marketing that affiliates you with that brokerage is stopped. This includes ads, mailings, social media, signage and business cards. If you have deals in play, you should confirm or discuss with your broker the payment of those commissions; keeping in mind that those commissions are the brokers, not yours, and you cannot automatically take those deals with you to another brokerage without your soon-to-be former brokerage’s permission. In fact, a broker is entitled to keep the listing that you worked so hard on, give it to someone else and, in fact, give that other agent the MLS credit too (and possibly the commission—it all depends on your ICA).</p>
<p><strong>Release of Your Real Estate License</strong></p>
<p>When an agent decides to leave a brokerage, the broker of record must release that agent’s license back to the state. From there, the new brokerage will pick up that agent’s license. However, there are rules surrounding this transition of the agent’s license.</p>
<p>N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 442-b mandates that “When the association of any real estate salesman shall have been terminated for any reason whatsoever, his broker shall <strong>forthwith</strong> notify the department of state thereof in such manner as the department shall prescribe.” Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary defines the meaning of the term “forthwith” as “1. Immediately; without delay. 2. Directly; promptly; within a reasonable time under the circumstances; with all convenient dispatch.”</p>
<p>Based upon the foregoing and the ability to effectuate a transfer electronically, the DOS has indicated that absent demonstrable and unusual circumstances, termination should not exceed five (5) days. Additionally, the DOS makes it clear that while a broker has “reasonable time under the circumstances” to wind up the agent’s activities, they cannot simply delay 5 days out of spite or pettiness. For example, if a broker falls ill suddenly and cannot terminate, he/she would most likely not face discipline because of the delay, even if it potentially ran beyond five days, as such delay may be considered “reasonable time under the circumstances.” However, a broker that fails to terminate simply because they think they have five days under all circumstances and/or is acting out of spite or pettiness, may face discipline. Unless there is a real compelling reason to delay the termination of a license, a broker has five days or less to do so. General housekeeping issues such as keys, paperwork, etc. will not relieve the broker of his/her duty to release the agent. Additionally, keep in mind that a broker who fails to timely release a licensee renders that licensee unable to work and the broker may be held liable for damages in a subsequent lawsuit. Further, it is important to remember that a broker’s failure to provide the required notice, without justification after five days, could potentially result in a disciplinary proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 441-c.</p>
<p>As noted above, once a real estate license is terminated, that agent cannot conduct any real estate activities whatsoever, including conducting old business, establishing new business, handing out old business cards or consulting, until they associate with a new brokerage. Doing so would be a violation of New York licensing law.<br />
<strong><br />
Clients</strong></p>
<p>Once you depart a brokerage, you must remember that all of the clients you were working with are and remain with the broker. This includes all homeowners with listing agreements and those with whom you have developed potential future business, so long as it was done on the brokerage’s behalf. Further, all the buyer agents you have are the clients of the broker as well, whether there is a written agreement or not. The same goes for landlords and tenants. While these clients are free to choose who they wish to work with and can choose to follow you to a new brokerage, you must keep in mind several things:</p>
<p><strong>You cannot encourage a client to leave a brokerage.</strong> You can say that you are leaving, but you cannot encourage the client to follow you. To encourage them to leave or assist them in trying to leave, could be a violation of Article 16 of the Code of Ethics. If a licensee were to do this prior to leaving, this may also be deemed a violation of the agent’s fiduciary duty to the broker and could result in a complaint to DOS.</p>
<p><strong>If the client has an exclusive listing agreement (listing or buyer agreement), then that client is bound by that agreement.</strong> They cannot unilaterally get out of that contract. If an agent encouraged that client to sign a new agreement, they may be causing a situation where that client will now be paying two commissions. In that situation, it may not only be a violation under the Code of Ethics (Article 16, Standards of Practice 16-9 and 16-14) but, worse still as such an action may be deemed an interference with a binding contract and subject that agent to a lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Joining and leaving a brokerage is not as easy as one may think. Make sure your ICA accounts for your commissions during and after your relationship ends. Make sure that your broker timely releases your license (within five days) and that you do not do any real estate work between the time that you leave one brokerage and join another. Lastly, remember that the people you are working with are not your clients; they are the broker’s clients. You can tell them where you are going, but you cannot make them or entice them to follow you. That decision is entirely theirs to make.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Various state and federal court decisions have been issued recently impacting the real estate industry. At the federal level, two important decisions have been issued relating to antitrust lawsuits involving the payment of real estate commissions and the Department of Justice’s investigation initiated in 2019 into the National Association of Realtors’ Clear Cooperation Policy and Participation Rule. In New York, two lawsuits uphold the doctrines of “Buyer Beware” and “Time of the Essence”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moehrl v. NAR</em></strong><strong>:</strong> <strong>The Commission Lawsuit Moves Ahead</strong></p>
<p>On March 29<sup>th</sup>, the judge in <em>Moehrl v. NAR</em> [see <a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3KNdo8j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tmsnrt.rs/3KNdo8j</a>] issued an order granting class certification to the plaintiffs in the case. The class certification ordered in this lawsuit is a crucial ruling issued against NAR and the other defendants. While the case is far from over, a decision against NAR and the other defendants would not only dramatically alter the commission payment landscape across the country but could have a major impact on the entire real estate industry. The plaintiffs in the <em>Moehrl</em> case allege that the requirement that the sellers pay the commission in real estate transactions is a violation of federal antitrust laws by inflating the costs for sellers.</p>
<p>In <em>Moehrl</em>, the judge points out that the “Plaintiffs contend that together the NAR and Corporate Defendants have engaged in a continuing contract, combination, or conspiracy to unreasonably restrain price competition among real estate brokers in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1.” The plaintiffs each sold a home on a Multiple Listing Service (MLS) that implemented and engaged in the practice of unreasonably restraining price competition and “therefore paid a purportedly inflated commission to the successful buyer-broker.” This lawsuit is quite expansive and covers homes listed with the defendants on 20 NAR-affiliated MLSs across the nation.</p>
<p>There are two classes of individuals covered under the court’s certifications: (1) “Home sellers who paid a commission between March 6, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2020, to a brokerage affiliated with a Corporate Defendant in connection with the sale of residential real estate listed on a Covered MLS and in a covered jurisdiction;” and (2) “Current and future owners of residential real estate in the covered jurisdictions who are presently listing or will in the future list their home for sale on a Covered MLS.” The ruling relied on the testimony of two expert witnesses, a law school professor from Harvard University School of Law, and an economics professor from New York University. According to an article published by <em>Inman</em>, the NYU economics professor “estimated that total class damages in the case come to $13.7 billion. If the court awards treble damages, that figure could go up to $41.1 billion.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3Gz4s42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Gz4s42</a>]. This case is extremely important for the real estate industry and will be closely followed.</p>
<p><strong><em>DOJ v. NAR</em></strong><strong>: Clear Cooperation Policy and Participation Rule</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, the DOJ opened an investigation into certain NAR policies, including the Clear Cooperation Policy and the Participation Rule, by issuing Civil Investigative Demands to NAR. The DOJ alleged that these policies violated antitrust laws and they restrict competition and prevent real estate agents from offering lower commission rates and alternative service models to consumers.</p>
<p>NAR’s Clear Cooperation Policy generally requires that brokers who are Realtor members publicly advertise all properties that they list for sale, regardless of whether the listings are intended to be sold through the MLS or through other means. The Participation Rule, on the other hand, requires that brokers who participate in the MLS share their listings with other MLS participants and offer compensation to other brokers who introduce buyers to a real estate transaction. The DOJ argued that these policies limit competition and consumer choice, and ultimately violate antitrust laws.</p>
<p>In 2020, the DOJ and NAR negotiated a settlement of the DOJ’s action and ultimately, the DOJ entered a Complaint, Stipulation and Order, and Proposed Final Judgment with the court. On the same day, the DOJ sent a “closing” letter to NAR which confirmed “‘that the Antitrust Division has closed its investigation into (NAR’s) Clear Cooperation Policy and Participation Rule’ and that NAR ‘Accordingly’ had ‘no obligation to respond to’ the corresponding CIDs.’” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/40QN42O" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/40QN42O</a>].</p>
<p>After the DOJ and NAR entered into their Settlement Agreement, NAR made changes to these policies in order to comply with the terms of the Settlement, and submitted the changes to the DOJ for approval. In early 2021, NAR reached out to the DOJ for an update and received no response. In April, the DOJ ultimately responded, however, it tried to renegotiate the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and in July 2021, the DOJ issued new CIDs and reopened its investigation.</p>
<p>On Jan. 25, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, issued a Memorandum Opinion holding that “not setting aside the CID at issue would deprive NAR of the benefit for which it bargained: the closure of the Antitrust Division’s investigation into its Participation Rule and Clear Cooperation Policy. The government, like any party, must be held to the terms of its settlement agreements, whether or not a new administration likes those agreements. For this reason, the CID at issue must be set aside. A separate order will issue.” This is a very important decision as it not only allows NAR’s Clear Cooperation Policy and Participation Rule to remain in place, but also firmly establishes that the government, like all parties, must abide by the terms of any agreement, including the Settlement Agreement entered into by the DOJ and NAR.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fink v. 218 Hamilton LLC</em></strong><strong>: Affirming </strong><strong>The Declaration of Time of the Essence</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Fink v. 218 Hamilton LLC</em>, [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3MADXPk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3MADXPk</a>], the contract of sale between the seller and purchaser included a customary mortgage contingency clause. The purchaser was provided with a 60-day mortgage contingency period to obtain a mortgage commitment. The mortgage contingency provision permitted the purchaser to cancel the contract and receive a refund of the down payment paid at contract signing if the purchaser was unable to obtain a commitment within the 60-day period.</p>
<p>The purchaser failed to obtain a mortgage commitment before the expiration of the mortgage contingency period, did not terminate the contract, and failed to request a return of the down payment. The purchaser also failed to close by the projected closing date contained in the contract. In light of the purchaser’s actions, the seller’s attorney sent a “time of the essence” letter and set a specific closing date. Upon receipt of the TOE letter, the purchaser requested a 10-day extension to close. The seller denied the purchaser’s request and no closing occurred.</p>
<p>The purchaser then sued the seller for specific performance and breach of contract. The Supreme Court, Kings County, denied the purchaser’s motion for summary judgment and granted the seller’s motion to dismiss. The purchaser argued that the TOE letter was defective because the seller knew that the purchaser needed additional time to close.</p>
<p>The court explained that when the contract was not terminated in accordance with its terms, the purchaser was bound to proceed with the transaction and had no further right to terminate the contract of sale, or to delay the closing.</p>
<p>According to the court, “there is no requirement that a time of the essence letter must consider the purchaser’s ability to close by that date. Indeed, if that were true then the entire expedient of sending such time of the essence letters would be undermined thereby.” The purchaser further argued that the contract of sale afforded the purchaser an additional 10 days to cure if it failed to close by the closing date. However, the court held that “where a time of the essence letter has been duly served and purchaser fails to abide by those terms, the purchaser is not afforded another 10 days [to cure] in addition to the time provided by the time of the essence letter.”</p>
<p><strong><em>R. Vig Properties, LLC v. Rahimzada</em></strong><strong>: </strong><strong>Caveat Emptor, Merger Doctrine Revisited</strong></p>
<p>On Feb.  23<sup>rd</sup>, the Appellate Division, Second Department, issued its decision in <em>R. Vig Properties, LLC v. Rahimzada</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40Zqe9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/40Zqe9k</a>], which upheld the longstanding doctrine of <em>Caveat Emptor</em> (“Buyer Beware”) and the merger doctrine. The parties entered into a contract of sale whereby the sellers (defendants) agreed to sell to the purchasers (plaintiffs) three improved commercial properties. The real estate transaction closed in 2006 and, in 2012, the plaintiffs sued the defendants alleging fraud and deceit, misrepresentation, and breach of contract.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants represented to them that one of the properties being sold was occupied by a tenant pursuant to “a self-sustaining triple-net master lease.” The plaintiffs further alleged, among other allegations, “that the defendants withheld from them certain facts…including the fact that the master tenant…was experiencing financial difficulties and absent rent concessions would breach the master lease and vacate the property; the fact that a prior determination of the United States Bankruptcy Court…relieved all prior assignees of the master lease for that property from liability notwithstanding that the terms of the master lease, annexed as an exhibit to the contract of sale, provided that such assignees were liable; and the fact that the tenant…was a single asset entity with no assets ….” This was all information that could have been investigated by the purchaser and/or was available publicly.</p>
<p><strong>The Doctrine of Buyer Beware: Fraudulent </strong><strong>Misrepresentation and Active Concealment</strong></p>
<p>In New York, it is well-settled that in real estate transactions purchasers are subject to the doctrine of <em>Caveat Emptor</em> (i.e., Buyer Beware). Purchasers must conduct all due diligence in connection with the purchase of real property and must satisfy themselves as to the condition of the property. There are very limited legal remedies available to purchasers post-closing.</p>
<p>One such remedy is a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation. The Court in <em>F. Vig Properties, LLC</em> explains that “a cause of action to recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation requires ‘a misrepresentation or a material omission of fact which was false and known to be false by defendant, made for the purpose of inducing the other party to rely upon it, justifiable reliance of the other party on the misrepresentation or material omission, and injury.’”</p>
<p>Another remedy available to a purchaser is a cause of action for active or fraudulent concealment. Ultimately, the court held “the facts alleged to have been misrepresented and/or improperly concealed were not matters peculiarly within the defendants&#8217; knowledge which could not have discovered by the plaintiffs by the exercise of ordinary intelligence and/or which thwarted the plaintiffs in their efforts to fulfill their responsibilities imposed by the doctrine of caveat emptor.” A seller is not required to disclose anything about the property unless required to do so by law or “some conduct (i.e., more than mere silence) on the part of the seller rises to the level of active concealment.”</p>
<p><strong>The Merger Doctrine</strong></p>
<p>Another important doctrine in contract law is the merger doctrine. The court in <em>F. Vig Properties, LLC</em> explains that “The merger doctrine in a real estate transaction provides that once the deed is delivered, its terms are all that survive and the purchaser is barred from prosecuting any claims arising out of the contract.” The court dismissed the plaintiff’s action based on the fact that all of the terms contained in the contract of sale merged into the deed, and the terms contained in the deed are the only provisions that survive the closing, unless the contract specifically provides that a particular provision or provisions survive the closing.</p>

<p>The report by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli indicated that the total value of projects approved by IDA for incentives in 2021 grew by 10.4% or $11.9 billion over the previous year. The total number of IDA projects increased by 1.5%. Meanwhile, total tax exemptions granted to developers by the IDAS in New York State grew by nearly 8%.</p>
<p>New York State Sen. James Skoufis (D-42) of Cornwall has been a vocal critic of IDAs statewide and specifically the Orange County Industrial Development Agency. He included a provision in the pending budget bill from the Senate to require a monitor to oversee the Orange County IDA’s operations.</p>
<p>“IDAs can play an important role in helping local economies and businesses expand. This report provides taxpayers with a look at the financial and project data reported by local IDAs so they can track their activities,” DiNapoli said. “The tax breaks IDAs provide can impact local taxes so it’s important to ensure these projects are creating or retaining the jobs and economic benefits they are supposed to. Publishing this information, including IDA costs, helps to increase their accountability.”</p>
<p>Since 2011, the number of active IDA projects has remained relatively stable, but total project value has been increasing, according to the report. Average project value over the period increased 76% from $16.5 million per project in 2011 to $29.2 million in 2021. County IDAs were responsible for 61.2% of all active IDA projects in 2021, followed by towns (18.5%), cities (12.3%), New York City (7.4%), villages (0.5%), and city-town IDAs (0.1%).</p>
<p>Some of the key findings of the DiNapoli report included:</p>
<p>• Tax exemptions for IDA projects totaled almost $1.9 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 7.7%, over 2020. The largest exemptions in any year are property tax exemptions, which totaled $1.7 billion, or 89.1% of the total exemptions.</p>
<p>• Net tax benefits for IDA projects (reflecting total tax exemptions minus payments in lieu of taxes) totaled almost $1.1 billion for the year, an increase of $87 million (9%) from the previous year. This continues a longer-term trend of increasing net tax benefits, the State Comptroller report stated.</p>
<p>• Project operators estimated that 221,287 jobs would be created during the life of their projects, with a median salary of $40,000. This is 1.7% (3,942 jobs) lower than in 2020. Another 241,236 jobs were retained with a median salary of $45,000.</p>
<p>• IDAs had total revenues of $132 million, an increase of $60 million from 2020. The New York City IDA had the largest revenues at $14.6 million, $12.3 million of which was attributed to the project finance fees from the refunding bond closings of Yankee Stadium LLC and Queens Ballpark Co. LLC (Citi Field).</p>
<p>• Total IDA expenses in 2021 were $79.3 million, down $5.4 million from 2020. The largest operating expense category for IDAs was professional service contracts for accounting, legal, or marketing services ($21.7 million, or 27%, of the total). Erie County IDA had the highest expenses ($9 million), followed by New York City IDA ($6.8 million), and Genesee County IDA ($5.9 million).</p>
<p>• IDAs reported 359 new projects in 2021, led by Finger Lakes region IDAs, which reported 80 new projects with a combined project value of $1.9 billion, followed by Long Island IDAs with 69 new projects with a combined project value of nearly $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>• The number of “clean energy” projects, increased from 25 to 85. Some of the increase is a result of the election by some IDAs to reclassify existing projects, but 34 of the 60 new clean energy projects were approved in 2021. North Country IDAs reported 30 clean energy projects in 2021, far outpacing other regions. In addition, Western New York IDAs reported 18 such projects and Southern Tier IDAs reported 14.</p>
<p>• Legislation enacted in 2020 temporarily authorized IDAs to provide loans and grants to small businesses and not-for-profit corporations during the COVID-19 State disaster emergency. Erie County IDA, which established a COVID-19 Emergency Grant Program in July 2020, was responsible for $5.8 million (68.1%) of all reported grants and donations in 2021.</p>
<p>Three IDAs—Town of Concord IDA, Town of Corinth IDA and City of Mount Vernon IDA—did not submit their data in time for this report. The State Comptroller’s report also contains information on Local Development Corporations, a related type of local authority.</p>
<p>The report summarized data as reported by IDAs for fiscal year end 2021 through the Public Authorities Reporting Information System (PARIS) and is not independently verified by the State Comptroller’s Office. While most IDAs operate on a calendar year basis, several, including the New York City IDA, do not.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[While not everyone has the same opportunities for homeownership, data show substantial variations and inequalities in homeownership rates across different income and racial and ethnic groups. For instance, low-income homeowners were able to build $98,900 in wealth in the last decade from home price ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>KANSAS CITY, MO—– A newly released housing report by the National Association of Realtors reveals middle-income homeowners accumulated $122,100 in wealth as their homes appreciated by 68% in the last 10 years. The report indicated all income earner brackets benefitted from home appreciation, however, some stark inequalities in benefits were revealed.</p>
<p>The report, <em>Wealth Gains by Income and Racial/Ethnic Group</em>, backs up the value agents and Realtors bring to consumers when helping buy and sell homes that build generational wealth. NAR released the report on April 18 during its 2023 Realtor Brokers Summit this week as the association commemorates Fair Housing Month.</p>
<p>While not everyone has the same opportunities for homeownership, data show substantial variations and inequalities in homeownership rates across different income and racial and ethnic groups. For instance, low-income homeowners were able to build $98,900 in wealth in the last decade from home price appreciation only, while upper-income households saw an increase of $150,800.</p>
<p>“This analysis shows how homeownership is a catalyst for building wealth for people from all walks of life,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “A monthly mortgage payment is often considered a forced savings account that helps homeowners build a net worth about 40 times higher than that of a renter.”</p>
<p>Although Black homeowners experienced the smallest wealth gains among any other racial or ethnic group, these owners were able to accumulate more than $115,000 in wealth in the last decade. For the first time in this report, NAR identified the top 10 U.S. metro areas which have recorded the largest wealth gains for Black homeowners over the last 10 years. Black households in Bellingham, WA; Ocala, FL; Palm Bay, FL; Modesto, CA; Greeley, CO; and Charleston, SC were among the areas where more than 60% of Black households own their home. Owners in these areas were able to accumulate more than $125,000 in wealth in the last decade.</p>
<p>Along with the wealth gains accumulated in the last decade, homeowners also saw their debt drop by 21%. Many homeowners who were able to refinance and secure a rate lower than 4% in the months following the onset of COVID-19 may have paid off an even larger amount of their mortgage, Yun noted.</p>
<p>According to data supplied by the National Association of Realtors to<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em>, in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA market, White homeowners saw a $165,530 increase in wealth in the past decade as compared to $164,390 for Black homeowners; $199,990 for Asian homeowners and $154,780 for Hispanic homeowners.</p>
<p>In the New York metro market, the homeownership rate for low, middle and upper-income households was 34.5%, 59.6% and 77.1% respectively. The wealth gains during the past decade by income bracket were $118,630 for low-income households; $134,900 for middle-income and $140,570 for upper income households in the region.</p>
<p>The New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA ranked seventh in the nation with the highest share of low-income households at 41%, according to the NAR study.</p>
<p>“Your neighborhood Realtor is a champion able to help you achieve the dream of homeownership,” said NAR President Kenny Parcell, a Realtor from Spanish Fork, UT, and a broker-owner of Equity Real Estate, UT. “Homeownership helps create long-term wealth and financial stability for your family and future generations.”</p>
<p>No matter the income level, owners who live in expensive metro areas experienced the largest wealth gains. In the San Jose, CA metro area, low-income owners have accumulated nearly $630,000 in the last decade, and middle-income owners gained $643,000. All of the top 10 areas with the largest wealth gains for low-income owners—surpassing $290,000—were located in California.</p>
<p>In the top 10 areas with the highest homeownership rates for middle-income households, owners gained $110,000 in wealth on average in the last 10 years. In Ogden, Utah, for example, with 85% of the middle-income households owning their home, homeowners have built nearly $220,000 in wealth in the last decade.</p>
<p>Some significant areas to note include Port St. Lucie, FL, where the homeownership rate for middle-income households was 83%, and middle-income owners gained nearly $200,000 in wealth. The metro areas of Barnstable Town, MA and Palm Bay, FL were some other areas where most middle-income households own their home and accumulated a substantial amount of wealth—more than $170,000—in the last decade.</p>
<p>Respectively, in the areas with the highest homeownership rates for low-income households, wealth gains were $140,000 on average. In Prescott, AZ while more than two out of three low-income households (68%) own their own home, owners have built more than $200,000 in wealth in the last decade. Barnstable Town, MA, as well as the Florida metro areas of North Port, Port St. Lucie, Palm Bay and Deltona, were other areas where most low-income households owned their home and accumulated a substantial amount of wealth—over $120,000—in the last decade.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Up for debate are Good Cause Eviction, Bail Reform and 421a. What this means for HGAR and our members is that we need to work that much harder to garner the attention we need for our issues as Realtors, entrepreneurs and individuals.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>As of the writing of this column, the New York State budget is late and still has not passed. Often referred to as the “Big Ugly,” the state budget has historically been negotiated on time, meaning by April 1st, for most of the 2010s under Governor Andrew Cuomo. Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration has made increasing housing stock and bail reform some of her top priorities, and so far, she is not budging, even in spite of the Assembly and Senate almost wholly rejecting the housing growth plan.</p>
<p>How this all plays out is anyone’s guess. In the not-to-distant past, New York State has operated without a budget for months by funding the government through short-term extensions.</p>
<p>Also, up for debate are Good Cause Eviction, Bail Reform and 421a. What this means for HGAR and our members is that we need to work that much harder to garner the attention we need for our issues as Realtors, entrepreneurs and individuals.</p>
<p>As a reminder, below are a few of the issues we will be advocating on May 2nd.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Priorities</strong></p>
<p><strong>HGAR is in Opposition to:</strong></p>
<p>• (S.305-Salazar) HGAR opposes the imposition of a statewide “Good Cause” eviction standard, which would implement impractical and overly restrictive standards and stifle investment in rental housing.</p>
<p>• (S.2783-Brisport) HGAR opposes the prohibition of landlords and landlords’ agents from collecting broker fees from a tenant.</p>
<p>• (S.2352-Kavanagh) HGAR opposes the requirement on real estate brokers and salespersons to request, compile and disclose personal demographic data on prospective home purchasers, including full name, race, ethnicity and gender, among other information.</p>
<p>• (S.2505-Kavanagh) The New York State Association of Realtors opposes the creation of a statewide residential rental registry and public online searchable database that would require owners of residential rental dwellings, housing two or more families living independently of each other, to register their property annually for a fee to be determined by the Department of State.</p>
<p>• (S.221-Myrie) HGAR opposes the establishment of the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would provide tenant organizations the first opportunity to purchase rental properties prior to being put on the market, impose price stabilization provisions on the property for up to 99 years, cap annual rent increases and prohibit the eviction of any TOPA buyer except for “good cause.”</p>
<p>• (S.2353-Kavanagh) HGAR opposes the requirement of property owners to conduct lead paint tests and provide reports of such tests prior to the selling or leasing of a property.</p>
<p>• HGAR opposes regulatory efforts by the Department of State to impose any new cease and desist zone on real estate licensees.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Supports:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Measures to Expand Access to Homeownership</strong></p>
<p>• HGAR supports enacting a first-time homebuyer savings account program to assist New Yorkers in saving for a first home within the state (bill introduction pending).</p>
<p>• HGAR supports expanding affordable and workforce housing development through the implementation of new zoning and tax incentives and easing restrictions on the conversion of existing commercial spaces into residential housing.</p>
<p>• HGAR supports directing funding in the New York State budget to expand broadband access throughout the state, particularly in rural regions.</p>
<p><strong>Combating Discrimination in Cooperative Housing</strong></p>
<p>• (A.1778-Lavine) (A.2685-Walker) HGAR supports ensuring fairness and transparency in the cooperative housing purchase process by establishing a clear timeline for the response to applicants by co-op boards and requiring a reason for any denial of an application in order to help combat illegal discrimination.</p>
<p>• (S.412-Thomas) HGAR supports a technical amendment to a law passed in 2019 placing restrictions on legitimate telemarketing business services provided by licensed professionals, stipulating the ability to provide telemarketing services during states of emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are many other issues still being flushed out at press time that will be addressed prior to Lobby Day.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Lobby Day</strong></p>
<p>If I have not stressed this enough -Tuesday, May 2nd is NYSAR’s Annual Lobby Day in Albany. This is where HGAR, and other boards/associations across the state, get to take their agendas and make their voices heard. We already have more than 80 fellow Realtors attending Lobby Day. Please join them.</p>
<p>This is a free and fun trip to Albany where you get the opportunity to meet with your State Representatives and make clear to them the issues that are important to our members and our industry.</p>
<p>We have two busses to take you to and from Albany. One bus will leave at 5:50 a.m. from outside the HGAR offices at 110 Bloomingdale Rd., White Plains, and will stop at the DeCicco’s Market in Brewster at 6:30 a.m., before arriving in Albany. The other bus will depart at 5:50 a.m. from the former HGAR office in Nyack, located at 2 Medical Park Drive, and will stop at 6:30 a.m. at the rear of the Newburgh Mall, before continuing to Albany. Both busses will depart Albany after lunch to return home.</p>
<p>Again, I want to encourage you to get involved and join us on May 2nd. Additional information and details for Lobby Day can be found at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/event/lobby-day-in-albany-20230502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/event/lobby-day-in-albany-20230502</a> or you can contact me directly at <a href="mailto:Alexander.Roithmayr@HGAR.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander.Roithmayr@HGAR.com</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Anyone who has ever been to a Disney theme park is familiar with the popular boat ride attraction featuring dolls of the world singing and dancing throughout the seven continents. “It’s a Small World” is meant to show how today’s world is really smaller than we think—given the technology now that can bring us all closer together.</p>
<p>Clayton Livingston, a commercial broker with McGrath Realty in Pawling, recently found out for himself that indeed it is a small world after all. He had no idea that his first trip to MIPIM, the largest commercial real estate conference in the world, would result in an amazing connection that could bring a multi-million-dollar investment to New York. Held in March in Cannes, France, MIPIM is a four-day conference attracting thousands of real estate and related professionals throughout the globe and offering hundreds of exhibitors and events.</p>
<div id="attachment_44321" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44321" class="wp-image-44321" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Global-pic-4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="380" /><p id="caption-attachment-44321" class="wp-caption-text">Yshay Manos (right) with two Portuguese colleagues, while attending the 2022 Trade Mission to Portugal.</p></div>
<p>Livingston was offered the opportunity to give a short pitch for one of his commercial properties, and as soon as he finished, he was approached by real estate professionals from Milan, Italy representing international investors interested in expanding their portfolio in Manhattan. “They told me their client was looking for a residential-over-retail type of development to add to a similar type of investment they currently have in Manhattan’s Soho district,” he said. “Of course, I was quite surprised—that’s not the kind of connection you make every day!”</p>
<p>The Milan real estate agents visited Manhattan in early April and Livingston showed them about 10 possible properties, many in Soho and Greenwich Village. “I have no doubt that if they come back, they’ll be looking to close a deal,” he added. In the meantime, he’s been in constant connection with them.</p>
<p>As the 2023 President of HGAR’s Commercial and Investment Division, Livingston believed it was important for him to attend the MIPIM conference. “It was actually mind-boggling,” he said of the thousands of attendees and exhibitors. Some pavilions, such as Dubai and Egypt had their own 10,000-square-foot tents, while other countries exhibited inside 30-foot yachts. “This is the future happening before our eyes,” he said. “If you do any type of commercial development or sales, you definitely want to be here.”</p>
<p>MIPIM has been around for the past 32 years. One of its founders is FIABCI, the world’s largest international real estate association. Currently, HGAR member Susan Greenfield serves as FIABCI’s 2023 World President and Eugenia Foxworth, another HGAR member, had served as President of FIABCI-USA in 2021.</p>
<p>“Basically, two types of people attend MIPIM,” said HGAR President Tony D’Anzica. “There are people who are trying to sell their region of the world, and others who are trying to invest in a particular region. HGAR’s mission in being there was to promote our region—the New York metro area and Hudson Valley.”</p>
<p>D’Anzica has played a vital role in HGAR’s Global Business Council since the group was founded in 2018. Just last year, HGAR received the Platinum Global Achievement Program Award from the National Association of Realtors for its global services initiatives.</p>
<div id="attachment_44325" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44325" class="wp-image-44325" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HGAR-New-York-Kiosk-MIPIM-e1682002189283.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-44325" class="wp-caption-text">HGAR hosted a New York area kiosk at the MIPIM<br /> Conference as part of the National Association of<br /> Realtors’ USA Pavilion along with other state and regional associations.</p></div>
<p>Last June, HGAR’s Global Business Council organized its first Trade Mission to Portugal that was hosted by real estate partner, Portugal International Realty. The HGAR contingent was also hosted by the Porto City Council at City Hall, and later attended a dinner hosted by the Mayor of Porto. In addition, the group formed a new relationship with APEMIP, Portugal’s national professional real estate association. “Our goal is to help foster business not only across borders but also between our own communities,” said D’Anzica. “We want to encourage people to invest in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Yshay Manos, a broker with Nova North Commercial in New City and Coldwell Banker Commercial in Fort Lee, NJ attended the Trade Mission to Portugal because he was looking to expand his real estate business on an international level. “In recent years, Portugal has become an increasingly popular destination for Americans,” he said. “It’s been a fast-growing market for real estate investments and ranked as the best country for business, and as a relocation destination, so I saw this as an excellent opportunity to get involved.”</p>
<p>Manos also holds Portuguese citizenship and had been planning to gain insight and familiarize himself with the rich cultural heritage of the country. In addition to being able to better understand the local real estate market and customs, he was also excited about the opportunity to network with local government officials. “It can help navigate the bureaucratic process of doing business in Portugal, we can learn about development initiatives, and they can provide access to valuable information about the Portuguese market,” he explained.</p>
<p>As a result of his trip, Manos began to cultivate business relationships with Portuguese real estate professionals, developers, attorneys and government officials. He also joined social media groups focused on real estate investments and relocation to Portugal. “This offered me a platform to showcase my services and expertise to potential clients and partners,” he added.</p>
<p>Born in Israel, Manos has traveled extensively, living for a time in Europe and Japan before settling in New York. Involved with the arts and antiques, he even owned an art gallery, dealing with many Asian clients. “I have always loved working with different cultures,” he said.</p>
<p>Prior to the Portugal Trade Mission, he hadn’t done any transactions outside of the U.S., but has worked with people from Israel, Europe and South America helping them find residential and commercial properties here in America. With more than 20 years in the real estate business, Manos felt it was the right time to broaden his reach.</p>
<div id="attachment_44324" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44324" class="wp-image-44324" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Global-pic-1-e1682002019442.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="464" /><p id="caption-attachment-44324" class="wp-caption-text">Clayton Livingston making his pitch for New York commercial property at the MIPIM Conference in France.</p></div>
<p>Just a few months after returning from Portugal, he began working with an American couple seeking property in the Lisbon area. His Portuguese real estate partner gave the couple a tour of the area and they are still considering their options. Manos has also met with foreign investors visiting New York City who are now interested in investing in Portugal as well. Even his colleagues in Israel are considering a permanent move to Portugal. “This is something I’ve wanted to do for many years and I’m very passionate about continuing to expand. My goal is to establish myself as an international expert,” he revealed.</p>
<p>Most of his potential international business abroad is comprised of people seeking residential properties but he recently began working with investors from Long Island who are interested in income-producing properties like apartment buildings in Portugal.</p>
<p>“Attending a trade mission can be a great way to explore new business opportunities, expand your network, and gain market knowledge, and I would highly recommend it,” said Manos. “Even without the international aspect, the relationships and connections I’ve developed with some of the other team members of the trade mission have also enriched both my professional and personal lives.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Manos is busy completing his Certified International Property Specialist (CIPS) designation to further support his global efforts.</p>
<p>Karen Benvin Ransom, an Associate Broker with Houlihan Lawrence in Bedford, also joined the trade mission to Portugal. “I had been to Europe many times, but not to Portugal,” she recalled. “I know lots of people who are thinking about where they’d like to retire. In the past, many have opted for the Carolinas or Florida, but with the inflated prices there, now they may as well have the glamour of retiring to live in Europe.”</p>
<p><em>Live and Invest Overseas Magazine</em> has consistently ranked Portugal as one of the top foreign retirement destinations with its great weather, a wealth of restaurants and attractions, educational opportunities, great healthcare system and one of the lowest costs of living in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Ransom said real estate taxes are extremely low compared to those in the New York metro area. “I attended one event where people were talking about taxes and said they could be up to $1,000. I asked if that was per month and was told no— per year! I almost fell off my chair,” she quipped.</p>
<p>After returning home following her trip, Ransom began reaching out to various clients and using social media to attract anyone who might be interested in purchasing property in Portugal. She has already connected a few of them with Portuguese real estate agents and will earn a referral fee should they purchase property there. One of her social media posts indicated that 45% of foreign homebuyers in Portugal are Americans.</p>
<p>“I’m all about the world market,” she added. “Business, especially real estate, is all about relationships. So why not cast a wider net into European markets or any other market that would be of service to your clients?”</p>
<p>Since the 2022 Portugal trip, HGAR continues to communicate with its counterparts in Portugal. For those who may be interested in purchasing a retirement home or second home, D’Anzica said just like in New York, it depends on where they look. “Lisbon is very expensive, but if you go further out from the city, you can find some great deals,” he said.</p>
<div id="attachment_44323" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44323" class="wp-image-44323" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Global-pic-3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-44323" class="wp-caption-text">Karen Benvin Ransom outside her “castle” hotel in Portugal, while attending the 2022 Trade Mission to Portugal.</p></div>
<p>For Portuguese residents either relocating or purchasing investment properties in New York, again, it depends on what they want. “Many are looking for a safe place to park their money and others have children attending college and want them to have a more secure type of residence than a typical dormitory,” he added.</p>
<p>Unlike some other nations, the U.S. does not require a green card or citizenship for someone to purchase a property. In Portugal, property investors are offered the opportunity for citizenship if they agree to invest in real estate. “Some countries are experiencing decreasing populations which could hurt their local economy, so offering citizenship helps them,” he added.</p>
<p>Ironically, D&#8217;Anzica and his team were finally able to connect with Melissa Román Birch, COO of the NYC Economic Development Corp. in France. “We had people right in our backyard who we had tried to reach, but ultimately made the connection at MIPIM,” revealed D’Anzica. “She was astonished with what HGAR has to offer and she now realizes that she has a local partner with whom she can work.” As a result of the connection, Birch has agreed to speak at HGAR’s Global Real Estate Summit this year.</p>
<p>For Realtors who want to tap into the global market, D’Anzica suggested they might want to obtain a CIPS designation and join international organizations like FIABCI.</p>
<p>Some of the other recent initiatives HGAR’s Global Business Council has undertaken include its informative Global Business Chat series with representatives from various countries, along with hosting one of Dubai’s leading developers, Nahkeel at HGAR’s offices in White Plains. HGAR has also offered CIPS classes in conjunction with NYSAR.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The negative trifecta of high inflation and mortgage interest rates and low inventory continues to put a significant dent in home buying sales volume in the New York City/Lower Hudson Valley market. Single-family home prices values continued to rise in the first three months of this year in some markets, but indications are that regionwide, single-family home sales values may have reached their cyclical highs.</p>
<p>Overall home sales in the region fell by as low as slightly below 25% (Bronx County) to as high as 38% in Rockland County in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to a year earlier. The rest of the region posted double-digit percentage sales volume declines in total residential sales, which include single-family homes, condominiums, co-operatives and 2-4 family multi-family homes. Westchester County had a decrease in residential sales of 32.7%, Putnam County saw a decrease of 31.7%, Orange County’s sales dropped 35.1% and Sullivan County’s sales were down 31.6%. Bronx County saw the smallest decrease in first quarter residential sales, at 24.8%.</p>
<p>Regionwide, single-family home sales fell sharply in all markets. Westchester County saw a 33% decline in single-family sales in the first quarter 2023 as compared to 12 months earlier; Putnam County’s single-family sales dropped 29.3% in the first quarter; Rockland County’s single-family market sales volume declined by 35.3%; Orange County’s single-family sales volume fell 38.2%, while Sullivan County’s single-family sales were 30.2% lower and Bronx County experienced a decline of 25.1% in single-family sales in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Single-family median sales prices continued to rise in the first quarter in Westchester County (4.3% increase to $760,000), Rockland County (4.2% increase to $625,000) and Orange County (5.2% increase to $394,500). Putnam County saw a 5.3% decrease in the median sale price to $450,000, Sullivan County saw a 5% decrease to $254,500, and Bronx County saw a 2.5% decrease in the first quarter of 2023 to $585,000.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> See the full “<a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-1st-Quarter-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-Market-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 First Quarter Real Estate Sales Report Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx Counties, New York” released by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors on April 11.</a></p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, falling mortgage rates create opportunities for many buyers. On April 13, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun noted that the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 6.27% from 6.28% the previous week. “With inflation moving closer to the Fed&#8217;s 2% target, mortgage rates are expected to decrease further in the coming months, likely below 6% by year&#8217;s end,” Yun said.</p>
<p>This should improve conditions somewhat as Yun related that if rates drop to 6%, “3.1 million more households will once again be able to afford to buy the median-priced home compared to the beginning of the year. And, one in three of these households are younger than 40. Last year, one in five mortgage purchase originations had a rate higher than 6%.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that NAR’s Yun has previously stated that the housing market is in recession and more analysts are predicting an economic downturn or recession later this year. Area Realtors appear pragmatic that the market’s recovery will hinge greatly on a significant increase in the number of new home listings.</p>
<p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica noted that regionally overall sales volume dramatically declined by between 25% to 39%. “The demand for homes has been reduced as rising interest rates make the cost of borrowing more expensive and the cost of owning a home less affordable. Interest rates, which are at a 15-year high and still higher than they were one year ago, are also contributing to lower inventory by discouraging sellers from listing their homes for sale since staying put with an existing mortgage is less costly than moving and re-purchasing at a much higher interest rate,” he said.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Anzica, who is Broker/Owner of Dynamax Realty NYC in New York City, added, “While interest rates are starting to trend downward, more economists are predicting a recession in 2023. Jobless claims have been trending up all year, suggesting that uncertainty in the labor market may further discourage buyers from entering the housing market. With the war in Ukraine, an uptick in trade tensions, recent bank failures, and rising national debt, there are few market indicators that suggest an improvement in the housing market in 2023.”</p>
<p>In the brokerage firm’s recently released first-quarter housing report, Liz Nunan, Houlihan Lawrence, President and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence, noted that in addition to high interest rates and low inventory, buyers may be hesitant to enter the market due to the troubles of late in the banking sector. “The inventory quandary, however, has continued to drive a predominantly sellers’ market forward. Compared to other parts of the country, the marketplace north of New York City remains strong,” she added.</p>
<p>Anthony Cutugno, Senior Vice President, Private Brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence, stressed that despite market headwinds, there are buyers in the luxury market. “Persistent supply chain issues have increased demand for move-in condition, and aptly priced, updated luxury offerings are often rewarded with multiple offers at the lower end of the luxury market,” he said. “Conversely, ambitiously priced, poorly presented listings are overlooked. Concerns of overpaying are on every buyer’s radar as the fear of a longer, deeper recession looms on the horizon as a result of the banking crisis.”</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, Managing Partner and Chief Creative Officer of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, stated that the brokerage firm predicted last fall that home sales this year would fall to levels last seen in the middle of the 2010s when the housing market was recovering from the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>“We believe that prediction is playing out, with first quarter sales throughout the region falling to the levels we last saw in 2013-15. That might seem a little alarming, but we would caution that we all considered those types of closing levels to be relatively strong at the time. It&#8217;s not as if we&#8217;re back to the sales totals of 2009, which were about 50% of what they are right now. This isn’t a return to the Great Recession,” Rand stressed.</p>
<p>In fact, he predicts that home sales volume and prices will stabilize near 2022 levels for the remainder of the year. Rand stated that most markets have probably seen their high-water marks for home sale prices.</p>
<p>In terms of any improvement in for-sale inventory, he noted that basic economics calls for that when prices go up, supply will rise as sellers see an opportunity to take advantage of high prices. However, he cautioned, “But one concern we have is that too many homeowners are locked into their current homes by &#8220;golden handcuffs&#8221;—a ridiculously low interest rate on their mortgage, either from when they bought the home or from refinancing when rates were down around 3%. Even if those owners wanted to move, they might not be able to afford the higher payment they&#8217;d have to make at today&#8217;s higher rates. So, they might not be going to put their homes on the market, even if they want to take advantage of higher prices.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[HGAR President Tony D’Anzica reported that this year’s association contingent was by far the most to ever participate in a Lobby Day event.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—A new record of approximately 120 HGAR members and staff traveled to Albany on Tuesday, May 2 to meet with state lawmakers from the New York City/Hudson Valley regions to advocate on key real estate-related issues and legislation as part of the New York State Association of Realtors Lobby Day.</p>
<p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica reported that this year’s association contingent was by far the most to ever participate in a Lobby Day event. NYSAR officials also noted that this year’s participation by associations across the state was also a new record for attendance.</p>
<p>The HGAR delegation was led by HGAR President D’Anzica and was supported by HGAR Interim CEO and Chief Operating Officer Jana Currier; HGAR Legislation Committee co-chairs Leah Caro and Matthew Engel, along with Director of Government Affairs Alexander Roithmayr; Regional Director for Government Affairs Eliezer Rodriguez, Esq. and other support staff.</p>
<p>HGAR President D’Anzica after the more than an hour-long session with state lawmakers had concluded, told the HGAR membership, “This is probably the largest delegation of any association in New York State. A big round of applause to all of you.”</p>
<p>He then singled out the members of the Young Professionals Network and the Leadership Accelerator Program in attendance and then added, “I want to thank Jana, Alex and Eli for the hard work that they did, not to mention Matt and Leah for all the hard work they have done on the Legislative Committee. We have made this one of our key goals this year to get as many people to come to Lobby Day as possible. This is what we are—we are a trade association. We work on behalf of our members and on behalf of our industry.”</p>
<p>HGAR met with many state lawmakers on Tuesday and discussed a wide array of issues, including the state’s housing shortage, housing affordability and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s “New York Housing Compact” reform plan that called for the development of 800,000 new units of housing statewide in the next decade to name just a few.</p>
<p>Later that evening after HGAR members left the State Capital for home, Gov. Hochul and state legislative leaders hammered out an agreement on the $229-billion 2024 state budget. Gov. Hochul’s housing reform plan will be debated in this legislative session after the controversial proposal was shelved during budget negotiations.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the budget agreement include:</p>
<p>• $391 million for Emergency Rental Assistance Program Funding for NYCHA and Section 8 programs.</p>
<p>• Massive funding for the MTA from a variety of sources to help stabilize the agency’s operations that were impacted by COVID-19.</p>
<p>• Significant investments to promote energy affordability, reduce emissions, and clean air and water.</p>
<p>• Raising the Minimum Wage to $16 in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester and $15 elsewhere in the state, which will increase by $0.50 for two years and index to inflation after 2026.</p>
<p>In Albany, a host of state lawmakers appeared at the Hearing Room to meet face-to-face with HGAR members. Those lawmakers included: State Senators James Skoufis (42nd District); Bill Weber (38th District); Luis Sepulveda (32d District); Nathalia Fernandez (34th District) and Jamaal T. Bailey (36th District). Assembly members who attended the session were: Kenny Burgos (85th District); Yudelka Tapia (86th District); Amy Paulin (88th District); Nader Sayegh (90th District); Steven Otis (91st District); Maryjane Shimsky (92nd District); Chris Burdick (93rd District); Matt Sleter (94th District); Kenneth Zebrowski (96th District and Aileen Gunther (100th District).</p>
<p>Assemblywoman Inez Dickens (70th Distrtict) was represented by Counsel Ricardo A. Aguiree, Esq. and Assemblywoman Latoya Joyner (77th District) was represented by Legislative Director Rachel Morris at the Hearing Room meeting. HGAR representatives met with Assemblymen Al Taylor (71st District) and Alex Bores (73rd District) outside of the Hearing Room session.</p>
<p>Along with NYSAR representatives, HGAR officials also met with State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and with Miguelina Camila, Chief Legal Counsel for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie.</p>
<p>HGAR Acting CEO and Chief Operating Officer Currier related that HGAR has received “terrific feedback” from association members who attended the event, as well as state lawmakers that met with the HGAR delegation.</p>
<p>Richard McLymont, a real estate agent with Keller Williams NY Realty in White Plains, was a first-time participant in Lobby Day and told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> he plans to return to the State Capital in 2024 to meet with state lawmakers. McLymont is also a participant in this year’s HGAR Leadership Accelerator Program.</p>
<p>“Overall, it was a very humbling experience,” McLymont said. “it was humbling for me just because the magnitude of the decisions that are made by legislators can be profound, but when you are there to give a voice to what you are fighting for it kind of reaffirms the work you are trying to do in the business and to support the real estate industry.”</p>
<p>Among some of the chief legislative priorities of HGAR at Lobby Day included:</p>
<p>• Support of the bill (S. 412-Thomas) that would make technical amendments to current state law prohibiting telemarketing activities during declared state of emergencies.</p>
<p>• Strongly opposed any legislation that would increase state or local mortgage taxes or real estate transfer taxes.</p>
<p>• Opposed A.1814-Glick) that would impose a Pied-a Terre Tax on New York City homeowners. HGAR states the bill, if passed, would drive down property values, decrease the city’s tax base, and jeopardize thousands of jobs in hospitality, construction and real estate services.</p>
<p>• Strongly opposed Good Cause Eviction (S.305-Salazar/A. 4454-Hunter) that would impose a statewide rent regulation of all rental housing, except for owner-occupied buildings with less than four units. The bill would effectively limit a property owner’s operating income by establishing a rebuttable presumption against evictions for nonpayment where the annual rent increase is more than 3% or 1.5 times the CPI.</p>
<p>• Supported a package of bills that combat discrimination in cooperative housing. A. 1623-Perry requires co-op boards to adopt a standardized application process, and establishes a clear timeline for board action on such applications. These bills operate to remove arbitrary procedural barriers historically used to discriminate against prospective buyers of protected classes, and to focus board deliberations on an applicant’s substantive qualifications when considering a sale. S.1449-A-Sanders / A.6510-Walker requires a board to provide a prospective purchaser with a written statement of reasons for withholding consent to a sale, within thirty days of such denial. Together, these bills introduce predictability and fairness into a process that has long been manipulated to further discriminatory housing practices and segregate communities, according to HGAR.</p>
<p>• Opposed a bill S.562-A-Kavanaugh, A.920-A-Gallagher as currently drafted due to concerns with the unintended consequences it would have on rural households and low- and middle-income New Yorkers. The bill would direct the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council to prohibit the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, oil or propane in any newly constructed building under seven stories statewide by Jan. 1, 2024, and by July 1, 2027, in buildings seven stories or more—with limited exceptions.</p>
<p>• Supported S.6352-Comrie—the Local Regulated Housing Restoration Act—that is designed to add affordable rent-stabilized apartments to rental housing stock that are safe, lead free, energy efficient, and fully compliant with building codes. These apartments will be affordable for working families from the local communities where the apartments are located.</p>
<p>• HGAR strongly opposed all legislation that seeks to deprive real estate brokers and salespersons their hard-won status as independent contractors. A.4781(Mamdani) S.2783 (Brisport) seeks to address workers in the gig economy but contains imprecise and overly broad language that has the potential to upend the longstanding legal and logical employment relationship between real estate brokers and salespersons that is rooted in licensure requirements and industry-accepted professional standards. This legislation would redefine and reclassify this employment relationship in conflict with existing exemptions currently in law and relied upon by industry professionals. Unless and until this legislation is amended to exempt the broker-salesperson relationship, HGAR strongly opposes this bill’s passage.</p>
<p>Following Lobby Day advocacy efforts, legislation that would create a New York State first-time homebuyer savings account program (A.6933/S.6574) was introduced in the Assembly by Assemblymember Phil Ramos (Suffolk County). The bill would allow individuals and families to take a state income tax deduction on annual deposits into the account (up to $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for couples). Senator Jeremy Cooney (Rochester) carries the bill in the Senate. Support for this bill was among NYSAR’s and HGAR’s legislative priorities during Lobby Day.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York State released a 247-page report on May 5 that paints a damning picture of Fair Housing issues in the state, including the significant extent of housing segregation and racial discrimination in regions across the state.</p>
<p>The “Fair Housing Matters NY” report authored by the New York State Homes and Community Renewal&#8217;s Fair and Equitable Housing Office and Office of Research and Strategic Analysis revealed that approximately a third of New Yorkers live in highly white/non-white segregated counties, with 44% of downstate New Yorkers living in highly segregated counties. Another disturbing finding from the report is that approximately 95% of Black/African American households in New York live in a county that is highly segregated between Black/African American and white households.</p>
<p>“The work of undoing historic, systemic, and entrenched segregated living patterns and eliminating discrimination in housing will always be a priority of my administration,” Gov. Hochul said. “The findings in this report show that confronting these inequalities will require an aggressive multi-faceted approach. I look forward to working with our partners at the federal, state, and local levels to take the bold actions necessary to foster more diverse communities and create and preserve affordable housing for more New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>The report found not only segregated housing patterns throughout New York, but also that access to community resources, poverty, and substandard housing conditions consistently fall along segregated racial and ethnic lines, state officials noted.</p>
<p>The report’s findings also underscore other forms of segregation and inequitable access to resources beyond those centering on race and ethnicity. For example, state officials noted that older adults, those with limited English proficiencies and those with disabilities, also find themselves concentrated in areas of poverty with access to fewer community resources.</p>
<p>Other report findings of note were:</p>
<p>• Two-thirds of white households own their homes, compared to only a third of Black/African American households and a quarter of Hispanic/Latinx households that own their homes.</p>
<p>• Women and children experience poverty at higher rates in all regions of the state than men and adults.</p>
<p>• Households containing a member with a disability are much more likely to be classified as extremely low-income.</p>
<p>A particularly troubling finding from the public engagement connected with the study was that among the many factors described as contributing to these living patterns included “racism in real estate and lending, zoning and land use laws, gentrification and displacement, and the concentration of affordable and government-supported housing in distressed and disinvested areas of the state.”</p>
<p>New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said of the report’s findings, &#8220;Affirmatively furthering fair housing also means tearing down arbitrary barriers to housing that are experienced disproportionately by communities of color, immigrants, victims of domestic violence, and other protected and vulnerable New Yorkers. Under Gov. Hochul&#8217;s leadership, we will continue to analyze and combat systemic inequities and housing discrimination that prevent too many New Yorkers from building wealth, accessing opportunities, and living in safe, affordable homes in the communities they choose.”</p>
<p>The report recommended eight Fair Housing goals and a plethora of other action items geared at creating more access to housing through a combination of market-driven, regulatory, financial, and administrative changes.</p>
<p>Those goals included:</p>
<p>• Build upon opportunities for wealth creation through affordable home ownership.</p>
<p>• Increase access to suitable affordable housing for those with disabilities.</p>
<p>• Create more affordable housing with avenues for community support.</p>
<p>• Remove barriers to housing by addressing redlining and disinvestment in neighborhoods.</p>
<p>• Increase access to affordable housing by addressing barriers to housing choice.</p>
<p>• Increase access to affordable housing through fair housing education and enforcement.</p>
<p>• Promote development of affordable housing in areas where land use and development regulations provide barriers.</p>
<p>• Implement environmental justice principles in state-funded housing in response to climate change.</p>
<p>The “Fair Housing Matters NY” report follows a New York State Department of Financial Services report released in December 2022 that found continued racial disparities in mortgage lending practices on Long Island, in Rochester and in Syracuse. The report was part of an ongoing statewide inquiry into redlining and followed another DFS study that identified redlining and other forms of housing discrimination by mortgage lenders, particularly non-depository lenders, in majority-minority neighborhoods in Buffalo.</p>
<p>In August 2022, Gov. Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James acted to stop illegal and discriminatory housing practices at three Long Island real estate brokerages that were discriminating against Black, Hispanic, and other homebuyers of color, announcing settlements with the brokerages totaling more than $115,000. Those actions stemmed from a Newsday investigation in November 2019.</p>
<p>In Dec. 2021, Gov. Hochul signed into law nine fair housing bills designed to combat discriminatory housing practices that persist around the state. These bills included legislation to increase penalties for unlawful housing discrimination and creation of a fund to support fair housing testing. Another expands required training for real estate professionals on subjects such as the legacy of segregation, unequal treatment, and historic lack of access to housing opportunities.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the governor announced a $2.2-million expansion of New York&#8217;s Fair Housing Testing Program designed to root out discrimination in home rental and sale transactions. New York is partnering with six nonprofit organizations, including Westchester Residential Opportunities, Inc. of White Plains, to deploy undercover testers to act as potential renters and home seekers. The expansion will increase the state&#8217;s ability to proactively investigate suspected housing discrimination and to enhance education and outreach efforts on fair housing rights and requirements to landlords, tenants, real estate professionals, and local governments.</p>
<p>Marlene Zarfes, Executive Director of Westchester Residential Opportunities said the organization was not surprised with the report’s findings.</p>
<p>“Westchester Residential Opportunities (WRO) deeply appreciates the governor’s commitment to fighting discrimination and systemic inequities in housing, both of which exacerbate a critical lack of affordable and accessible housing in Westchester,” she said. “It lays bare what we have seen as a 55-year-old fair housing organization. We are hopeful, however, that this report is the start of addressing the imperative of increasing home ownership by Blacks/African Americans and Hispanic/Latinx, augmenting fair housing education and enforcement to prevent discrimination, and increasing accessible and affordable housing for people with disabilities.”</p>

In New York State, there are two specific provisions of the Code of Ethics that do not apply.

<p><strong>Article 3, Standard of Practice (SOP) 3-4</strong></p>
<p>Just as a refresher, Article 3 relates to agent-to-agent cooperation generally and touches on the obligations related to compensation. It specifically states that:</p>
<p><em>“Realtors shall cooperate with other brokers except when cooperation is not in the client’s best interest. The obligation to cooperate does not include the obligation to share commissions, fees, or to otherwise compensate another broker.”</em></p>
<p>Standard of Practice 3-4, which addresses dual or variable rate compensation, states the following:</p>
<p><em>“Realtors, acting as listing brokers, have an affirmative <u>obligation to disclose the existence of dual or variable rate commission arrangements (i.e., listings where one amount of the commission is payable if the listing broker’s firm is the procuring cause of the sale/lease and a different amount of commission is payable if the sale/lease results through the efforts of the seller/landlord or a cooperating broker)</u>. The listing broker shall, as soon as practical, <u>disclose the existence of such arrangements to potential cooperating brokers </u>and shall, in response to inquiries from cooperating brokers, <u>disclose the differential</u> that would result in a cooperative transaction or in a sale/lease that results through the efforts of the seller/landlord. If the cooperating broker is the buyer/tenant representative, the buyer/tenant representative must disclose such information to their client before the client makes an offer to purchase or lease.”</em></p>
<p>The underlined portions are the most important part of the provision. According to 3-4, if a listing Realtor has an agreement with the homeowner to adjust the overall listing commission if the listing Realtor procures the buyer for the listing (presumably adjusting the commission downward, thus reducing the homeowners overall commission costs), then the listing agent must disclose this arrangement to other potential cooperating brokers. For example, Realtor A lists the property for a 5% commission. However, if the agent procures the buyer, then Realtor A will agree to reduce the commission to 4%. This becomes a 1% savings to the homeowner.</p>
<p>The logic behind the purpose of this provision was that other cooperating agents should be aware of the listing agent’s “sweetheart” deal before the cooperating agent’s buyer makes an offer so that the presented offer may compete with the listing agent’s arrangement. Otherwise, the listing broker’s agreement may give the listing Realtor an unfair advantage against other competing cooperating agent’s buyer’s offers.</p>
<p>In 1992, the New York Department of State, Division of Licensing Services issued a declaratory ruling stating that the provisions of SOP 3-4 are unenforceable in New York. In its ruling, the DOS found that SOP 3-4 enables other Realtors to intrude on private negotiations between principal and agent and required disclosure of confidential information involving transactions to which the other Realtors were not a party. Furthermore, the DOS stated that such a rule created the threat of price fixing pressure that would result in harm to the public through inflation of the costs of real estate transactions.</p>
<p>In the end, the right to negotiate a private contract and the confidentiality related to private contracts outweighed the need for Realtors to disclose their variable rate agreement pursuant to the Code of Ethics. This means that if a listing agent has an agreement with a homeowner that may change the commission owed by the homeowner, they are under no duty to disclose that information to any other Realtors.</p>
<p><strong>Article 16, Standard of Practice 16-16</strong></p>
<p>Article 16 addresses a Realtors&#8217; duty to other Realtors. Its general tenet is that Realtors shall not interfere with another Realtor’s exclusive representation or exclusive brokerage relationship with its clients.</p>
<p>Standard of Practice 16-16 specifically states:</p>
<p><em>“REALTORS®, acting as subagents or buyer/tenant representatives or brokers, shall not use the terms of an offer to purchase/lease to attempt to modify the listing broker&#8217;s offer of compensation to subagents or buyer/tenant representatives or brokers nor make the submission of an executed offer to purchase/lease contingent on the listing broker&#8217;s agreement to modify the offer of compensation.”</em></p>
<p>NAR’s rationale for the creation of this rule stated that it was the listing broker that established the terms of compensation offered to subagents or buyer’s agents. The rule established that subagents or buyer agents could not leverage or withhold an offer to purchase to gain additional compensation from the listing agent.</p>
<p>In 1989, the DOS issued an opinion stating that SOP 16-16 was unenforceable in New York. In its opinion, the DOS stated that NAR was not correct on the law and that all licensees in New York should be aware that it is the seller, not the real estate broker, who has the right to establish the amount and terms of compensation offered to subagents and buyer’s agents and the seller is free to negotiate all terms of a deal. The DOS further stated that the rule failed to account for the rights of the buyer to fully negotiate the terms of a deal and to request a change in compensation for his/her agent.</p>
<p>The DOS added that the rule prohibited the buyer’s agent from making a counteroffer as to the amount of compensation offered by the listing broker and this places the buyer’s agent in the undesirable position of having to either abandon or be disloyal to his client and such coercion constitutes the tort of interference with a fiduciary relationship. As a result, the DOS determined that any Realtor found trying to enforce or obtain compliance with SOP 16-16 in the State of New York could be disciplined by the DOS.</p>
<p>As a result of the DOS holding SOP 16-16 as invalid in the State of New York, Realtors are free to negotiate their cooperating compensation at the direction of their client. However, a Realtor must still act in the best interests of their client; meaning that a Realtor cannot unilaterally take it upon themselves to withhold or change an offer to increase the cooperating compensation simply because they want a higher commission.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As Realtors, you must always be cognizant of the Code of Ethics. Additionally, you must also be knowledgeable about the rules that apply to all licensees in the State of New York. Sometimes, there’s a conflict between the Code of Ethics and the DOS; therefore, Realtors must always be on their toes and aware of the changing landscape through their ongoing practice, their communication with other agents, brokers, HGAR and NYSAR, and through continued education. If you don’t, you could be facing some serious problems.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said the Federal Reserve&#8217;s most recent rate hike was unnecessary, and he expects the Fed will stop raising interest rates further, during the “Residential Economic Issues &amp; Trends Forum” held at NAR&#8217;s 2023 Realtors Legislative Meetings on May 10.</p>
<p>Yun discussed recent developments in the U.S. economy and their impact on the housing market. Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, talked about the challenges that homebuilders continue to face and possible changes in the building sector. The forum closed with a panel discussion between Realtors Bobbi Howe of RE/MAX Regional Services, Kansas City, MO, and Maura Neill of RE/MAX Around Atlanta, who examined the current market conditions and challenges in their areas.</p>
<p>Yun explained that the Fed&#8217;s aggressive rate hikes have hurt regional banks and the housing market. He noted that inflation has already started to calm, but rents on apartments and single-family homes remain elevated.</p>
<p>“Inflation will not reignite—inflation will come down closer to 3% by the year&#8217;s end,” Yun stated. “Inflation has calmed down while rents are still accelerating.”</p>
<p>Yun said apartment construction has reached a 40-year to 50-year high.</p>
<p>“Rent growth will decrease because apartment construction—entry units coming on the market—is already in the pipeline,” Yun added. “We are already moving in the right direction towards consumer price inflation.”</p>
<p>Yun said that new home sales are back to pre-pandemic levels, however, existing-home sales are historically low. Currently, housing inventory is down 40% compared to 2019. The housing market is being held back by the lack of housing inventory, a problem that existed before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We have to stop the bleeding before improvement takes place,” he said. “We need to get more inventory, and the long-term solution is more home building.”</p>
<p>Yun explained that housing prices have run up dramatically because of the housing shortage but said recent price declines are temporary.</p>
<p>“Home price increases are naturally good for homeowners,” stated Yun. “Everyone participates in wealth gains if you&#8217;re a homeowner.”</p>
<p>Yun said there is a wealth gap between the typical homeowner and renter. He also said the homeownership rate has increased slightly, which means that more Americans will experience wealth gains and long-term financial security.</p>
<p>Yun forecasts that mortgage rates will fall closer to 6.0% in 2023 and go below 6.0% in 2024. He expects new and existing-home sales to bottom out in 2023 before an upturn in 2024.</p>
<p>Dietz agreed with Yun about housing supply and inflation.</p>
<p>“How do we solve the lack of inventory?” asked Dietz. “We&#8217;ve got to build more housing.”</p>
<p>He said that inflation is heading lower and the actions by the Fed since 2022 are working. Dietz added that we must build more affordable housing to tame inflation.</p>
<p>Dietz also highlighted the supply-side factors that pose a challenge for builders. Building materials costs have accelerated significantly. While the good news is that materials are 1%-2% cheaper, the bad news is there is less demand for building, Dietz noted. High lumber prices have come down but that&#8217;s because demand for lumber has reduced. There is a lack of labor for construction jobs. Acquisition, development and construction loans are very high – at 11%-12%. By raising interest rates, the Fed made it more expensive to build and develop housing. Regulatory costs also inhibit housing inventory improvements.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s death by a thousand cuts,” said Dietz. “It&#8217;s impossible to build entry-level housing when you&#8217;ve got—before putting a shovel in the ground—$200,000 in regulatory costs.”</p>
<p>From a construction perspective, Dietz stated that the remodeling market is the healthiest part of the building industry right now. He said that in the country&#8217;s housing stock, the average home is 41 years old. Dietz also stated that the custom-home building market has not declined; it&#8217;s gaining market share, and it had the best quarter of construction since the Great Recession. He said the market has cooled for single-family, built-for-rent homes, however those will remain an important part of the ecosystem. The apartment market continues to be strong, and there are 950,000 apartments under construction.</p>
<p>Dietz forecasted that the Fed will ease interest rates in 2024 but not in 2023.</p>
<p>“The back half of this decade looks really good,” Dietz added.</p>
<p>To close the event, Howe and Neill discussed opportunities in this real estate economy. Howe recommended taking emotion out of the equation and using the national-level data and breaking it down locally. Neill advised to come from a place of curiosity and keep in mind that national data needs to meet client needs. She also recommended coming from a place of abundance as opposed to scarcity in the context of high interest rates.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>In the early morning hours of Tuesday, May 2nd, two busloads of Realtors left the Hudson Valley and headed north. These buses, along with carloads of other individuals, met up with the rest of the HGAR lobby day contingent at the New York State Capital.</p>
<p>It became very clear to those who had attended Lobby Day that the Hudson Gateway Association was by far the largest contingent of Realtors in the state! Not only that, but HGAR’s attendance pushed this year’s Realtor participation past NYSAR records. Never had so many Realtors gathered for Lobby Day. Rumor has it that even the fire marshal was giving NYSAR trouble for having such al arge  crowd.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I want to thank the more than 120 HGAR members for making the trip to Albany. It was a historic day all around. For HGAR, we blew past last year’s number of 75 participants that filled out Hearing Room A. And for me, who had only been HGAR’s Government Affairs Director for four months, it was an overwhelming experience where I am beyond grateful for the level of enthusiasm, patience and participation by the membership. Thank you!</p>
<p>If NYSAR Lobby Day was not exciting enough, May 2nd was also the day that the long overdue $229-billion New York State budget was passed. Quite literally, while we were talking in hearing Room A in the Legislative Office Building, all around the capital, printers were feverishly printing bills, blurry-eyed staff were trying to maintain some sort of schedule and legislators were ducking in and out of meetings, all trying to finalize an over a month late state budget.</p>
<p>In what is being considered a black mark on the governor’s record, the New York State budget negotiations went way past the April 1st deadline. Legislators relied on several short-term extenders being passed by the Senate and Assembly to keep the state afloat. This is something that had not happened in New York State for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The negotiation lines were drawn around a number of contentious topics. Some of the budget highlights are direct aid to schools by more than $2 billion, raising the minimum wage in the coming years to $17, more funds for mass transit in the New York City metropolitan region, changes to the state&#8217;s bail law in response criticisms of previous bail reform changes and the end of the use of natural gas hookups and appliances in new construction in the near future.</p>
<p>One of the biggest take aways from the budget negotiations was that Governor Hockul dropped her New York Housing Compact plan that would have added more than 800,000 new houses in the next 10 years. Her strong-arm approach was met with stiff resistance from mayors and supervisors that would have lost some local control on their local zoning laws. Ultimately, the legislature sided with the mayors and the housing plan was dropped.</p>
<p>The New York State Legislative Session still has a few weeks before the state representatives call it a year. In that time there will be a lot of follow-up and legislative updates. So, stay tuned as we close out the legislative year.</p>
<p>Thank you again to all those who attended Lobby Day. It was truly a powerful day for the individual Realtor, HGAR and our issues. I was lucky enough to have the same view as the state lawmakers that sat in the Hearing Room on Lobby Day and looked out at what was a sea of Realtors. It was a truly powerful image of strength for HGAR and the real estate industry.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[This EDA Tourism Recovery Action Plan will support the development of the Westchester County Tourism Recovery Plan with research, strategic planning and prioritization of initiatives and projects to assist the tourism sector in recovering from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Tourism &amp; Film was recently awarded a $520,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce, through the Economic Development Administration, as part of the American Rescue Plan. This EDA Tourism Recovery Action Plan will support the development of the Westchester County Tourism Recovery Plan with research, strategic planning and prioritization of initiatives and projects to assist the tourism sector in recovering from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“The hospitality and tourism sector has shown remarkable resilience during the past few years” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer. “This unprecedented project will guide us to take our economic recovery to a new level, bringing jobs and economic benefits to the entire region. When one attraction succeeds, we all succeed as a destination.”</p>
<div id="attachment_44512" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44512" class="wp-image-44512" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Caramoor-Friends-Field-Stage-2-250x166.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-44512" class="wp-caption-text">Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, Katonah</p></div>
<p>Latimer launched the initiative at the “Guiding the Future of Tourism” forum held recently at the Westchester Marriott Hotel in Tarrytown. The event brought together tourism partners from hotels, arts and cultural attractions, transportation companies, chambers of commerce, and others.</p>
<p>Natasha Caputo, Director of Westchester County Tourism &amp; Film, said Westchester County was among the few regions to receive its own grant. “The EDA usually issues grants to states, so this is very impressive for us,” she said. “It shows that Westchester and the Hudson Valley are true destination spots with a lot to offer.”</p>
<p>In addition to the many historic tourist sites like Kykuit, the Rockefeller Estate in Tarrytown, Sunnyside, Washington Irving’s home in Irvington and Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in Katonah, the county offers some of the finest restaurants, shopping, waterfront nature trails and parkland in the New York metro area.</p>
<p>In 2019, prior to the onset of COVID-19, tourism had been a $2-billion industry in Westchester County. “But Westchester was first with a lot of closures during the pandemic,” explained Caputo. “Hotels, restaurants, and other indoor attractions were affected. With this grant, we can evaluate what has closed, what may be opening, what trends are taking place in the tourism sector, and what we can do to keep attracting visitors.”</p>
<p>Many hotels have reopened since then, but the Rye Town Hilton and Doral Arrowood remain closed. Caputo said while Westchester’s tourism industry is still strong, it’s lagging behind the pre-COVID days at $1.6 billion today. “Once we have a comprehensive review of our travel products, we can do a deep dive into our priorities and think about what we need for a full recovery,” she said.</p>
<p>Westchester County Tourism &amp; Film will be also working with a team led by Hunden Strategic Partners, a full-service, national destination development advisory practice to support the post-pandemic redevelopment and revitalization needs of the region. “We are excited to work on this comprehensive tourism action plan to help boost tourism and support workforce development,” added Caputo. “I look forward to collaborating to gain sector insights that are essential to the plan’s success.”</p>
<div id="attachment_44513" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44513" class="wp-image-44513" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Muscoot_Farm_Fall19_8795-250x167.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-44513" class="wp-caption-text">Muscoot Farm in Somers</p></div>
<p>Hunden Strategic Partners Founder, Rob Hunden noted that the recovery plan will include data-driven recommendations and action steps. “We are delighted to be working with Westchester County to reinvigorate its economy and grow it as a renewed tourism destination,” he said. “Our team has extensive experience evaluating the economic potential of tourism attractions and events as part of larger economic development goals.”</p>
<p>Hunden Strategic Partners is a leading real estate, tourism, and destination development consulting firm, with professionals in Chicago, San Diego, and Minneapolis. The firm offers a full range of tourism advisory, market and financial feasibility, economic and impact analyses, and other services for destinations. Its clients include cities, states, universities, and private developers.</p>
<p>The plan will include short, medium, and long-term actions and priorities recommended for recovery and growth of the tourism sector for maximum economic benefit in the region. The plans are expected to be completed by the end of September.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Total existing-home sales slid 3.4% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.28 million in April. Year-over-year, sales slumped 23.2% (down from 5.57 million in April 2022).]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales decreased more than 3% in April, according to the National Association of Realtors. All four major U.S. regions registered month-over-month and year-over-year sales declines. Home sales in the Northeast fell less than 2% last month, according to the NAR report.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales slid 3.4% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.28 million in April. Year-over-year, sales slumped 23.2% (down from 5.57 million in April 2022).</p>
<p>“Home sales are bouncing back and forth but remain above recent cyclical lows,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The combination of job gains, limited inventory and fluctuating mortgage rates over the last several months have created an environment of push-pull housing demand.”</p>
<p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of April was 1.04 million units, up 7.2% from March and 1.0% from one year ago (1.03 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.9-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.6 months in March and 2.2 months in April 2022.</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in April was $388,800, a decline of 1.7% from April 2022 ($395,500). Prices rose in the Northeast and Midwest but retreated in the South and West.</p>
<p>“Roughly half of the country is experiencing price gains,” Yun noted. “Even in markets with lower prices, primarily the expensive West region, multiple-offer situations have returned in the spring buying season following the calmer winter market. Distressed and forced property sales are virtually nonexistent.”</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 22 days in April, down from 29 days in March but up from 17 days in April 2022. Seventy-three percent of homes sold in April were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in April, up from 28% in both March 2023 and April 2022. NAR’s 2022 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2022—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 26%, the lowest since NAR began tracking the data.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in April, up from 27% in March and 26% the previous year.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 17% of homes in April, identical to March and one year ago.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 1% of sales in April, unchanged from last month and the prior year.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.35% as of May 11. That’s down from 6.39% the previous week but up from 5.30% one year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales waned to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.85 million in April, down 3.5% from 3.99 million in March and 22.4% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $393,300 in April, down 2.1% from April 2022.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 430,000 units in April, down 2.3% from March and 29.5% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $348,000 in April, an annual increase of 0.7%.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast receded 1.9% from March to an annual rate of 510,000 in April, down 23.9% from April 2022. The median price in the Northeast was $422,700, up 2.8% from the previous year.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales declined 1.9% from one month ago to an annual rate of 1.02 million in April, dropping 21.5% from the prior year. The median price in the Midwest was $287,300, up 1.8% from April 2022.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South decreased 3.4% from March to an annual rate of 1.98 million in April, a 20.2% decline from one year ago. The median price in the South was $357,900, down 0.6% from April 2022.</p>
<p>In the West, existing-home sales slipped 6.1% from the previous month to an annual rate of 770,000 in April, down 31.3% from the previous year. The median price in the West was $578,200, down 8.0% from April 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Should New Plan Utilize a Carrot or Stick?</h2>
<p>RYE—In the aftermath of Gov. Kathy Hochul’s failed “New York Hosing Compact” bold initiative that called for the development of 800,000 new housing units statewide to address what she termed is a housing crisis in New York State, real estate executives and government officials at a recent real estate conference agreed that the severe housing shortage in Westchester and New York State is real.</p>
<p>However, that is where consensus fell apart as the participants in the Westchester County Association’s 2023 Real Estate Conference could not agree on just how to solve the crisis—through incentives or via mandates and penalties for non-compliance or a combination of both.</p>
<p>The conference held on May 10 at the Westchester County Club in Rye focused on the housing market and the shortage of residential units, particularly affordable homes and apartments in the county.</p>
<p>William Cuddy, Executive Vice President of CBRE and chair of the WCA’s Real Estate Taskforce, provided context to the housing crisis debate by offering “five truisms” that currently exist in Westchester County:</p>
<p>1) “Real estate drives Westchester’s economy.” He said real estate directly impacts how people live, where they live, where they shop, where they get healthcare, where they recreate, where they work. “It is real estate-based. That is why you are here; real estate is critically important,” he stressed.</p>
<p>2) “Economic development and GDP performance are directly correlated to labor participation (jobs).”</p>
<p>3) “We have dramatically unmet jobs. We need more workers.”</p>
<p>4) “We lack workers because they don’t have housing.” He added that workers don’t have adequate housing or affordable housing.</p>
<p>5) “The current legislative and regulatory process for delivering more housing or any new development is ineffective and inefficient.”</p>
<p>“That is why we are here today,” Cuddy said. “We have to fix it.”</p>
<div id="attachment_44548" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44548" class="size-medium wp-image-44548" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JENKINS-AT-WCA-RE-CONFERENCE-250x167.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" /><p id="caption-attachment-44548" class="wp-caption-text">Deputy County Executive Ken Jenkins</p></div>
<p>Deputy Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins addressed the conference attendees by noting that while Gov. Kathy Hochul’s New York Housing Compact plan was withdrawn as part of state budget negotiations, Westchester County is ready to work with state political leaders on ways to address the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the county’s efforts to implement the finding of its latest housing needs assessment that called for 11,703 new housing units was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “It (New York Housing Compact) is not done,” Jenkins said, noting that Westchester County Executive George Latimer and his administration are planning to work with the state, as well as with municipal officials, including those that have facilitated new housing development, such as in Yonkers, New Rochelle and White Plains, to address the housing needs of its workforce.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker at the event—Joseph Graziose, Executive Vice President, RXR Development Services, discussed the firm’s ongoing phased massive redevelopment of the former White Plains Mall property into a mixed-use development that will eventually feature 860 new residential units, retail and commercial space and public park space. RXR is also the designated developer for the redevelopment of Downtown New Rochelle and is also involved in housing developments in the City of Yonkers.</p>
<p>Graziose praised Gov. Hochul for shining a light on the housing crisis. “I certainly commend the governor for identifying that there is a housing crisis and for pushing the initiative to try and create more housing in New York State. I selfishly would like to see more housing in Westchester County. But, I really think it is going to come down to working through the local level and having private developers, such as myself, working closely with municipal leaders, community leaders to get together to figure out a way to continue responsible and sustainable development. It is not going to happen overnight.”</p>
<p>He concluded his remarks by saying, “The housing crisis is real. There are numerous folks that are completely boxed out of living in New York State at all different economic levels…”</p>
<p>The conference also included a panel discussion moderated by Tom Murphy, Senior Resident Fellow, Urban Development at the Urban Land Institute. The featured panelists were: New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson, Town of North Castle Supervisor Michael J. Schiliro and Executive Director of the New York Housing Conference Rachel Fee.</p>
<p>It was this panel discussion that clearly showed the divide on how state and local governments should address the housing shortage in New York State.</p>
<p>Supervisor Schiliro stressed that North Castle has met its new housing goals, but there are sections of the town where new development would be difficult.</p>
<p>While also praising the governor for proposing a plan, municipalities were not included in its formulation, he charged. “For people who sit in my chair, we are looking for collaboration. We are looking for a seat at the table so we can be part of the conversation,” he said.</p>
<p>He noted that one part of the governor’s plan was to promote Accessory Dwelling Units. The supervisor noted that ADUs have existed in North Castle since the 1980s.</p>
<p>He added that the town has reworked its housing ordinances and “attainable” housing goals over the years, at times to address legal or legislative actions. The town’s housing stock has increased by 30% over the last 30 years, which is in line with the governor’s plan.</p>
<p>Supervisor Schiliro noted that towns and cities have different challenges and issues and perhaps different guidelines and housing goals. Therefore, rather than set local town and village housing goals, the state should set individual county goals for new development.</p>
<p>“The SEQRA (State Environmental Quality Review Act) process does need reform,” he said. “But there are many tenets of the SEQRA process that are important that allow communities like ours to let their residents be heard, make sure we are checking off all the boxes on what the issues are and be able to move projects forward.”</p>
<p>New Rochelle Mayor Bramson discussed the city’s groundbreaking zoning reform that included a form-based zoning code and generic environmental review that has resulted in projects that are in conformance with the downtown zoning requirements being approved from date of submission in 90 days.</p>
<p>He said that 30 projects in the downtown have been approved, with approximately a dozen completed and another 12 proposals under contract. The mayor stated that approximately 3,500 new housing units have been completed in the city, with another 3,500 under construction. The amended downtown zoning would allow for approximately 10,000 new units to be built.</p>
<p>Mayor Bramson said that there are many local governments that are doing their part in approving new housing developments without incentives or penalties being imposed by state government. “And yet, history tells us, the evidence shows us that if you are going to leave localities to do this on their own without input from the state, it is not going to happen with the consistency and the scale that is necessary to solve this problem.”</p>
<p>He agreed with Supervisor Schiliro that localities have different issues and their housing choices have an impact beyond their borders.</p>
<p>Mayor Bramson said that Gov. Hocul may have made a tactical mistake in proposing penalties for non-compliance even though he believes the state was hoping and perhaps never intending to impose those penalties, including the establishment of a state organization that could circumvent an unwarranted municipal rejection of a project.</p>
<p>“My suspicion is that this (state) circumvention route from a developer’s viewpoint would have been regarded as very unattractive,” the mayor said. “It takes a long time, there is a lot of brain damage, there is a lot of uncertainty associated with it and no one wants to drag a project through a community kicking and screaming when the community actually doesn’t want it.</p>
<p>Fee was supportive of most of the governor’s compact plan, but did state that the proposed $125 million devoted to local infrastructure needs was not adequate.</p>
<p>She noted that the State Legislature needs to take action now to address the urgent housing need and that many facets of the governor’s plan should be debated.</p>
<p>“I don’t think an incentives-only approach would be effective,” Fee said. “That is basically what we have now… Communities that don’t want to act that want to say ‘No’ to housing, that want to stall projects for years and years will just keep stalling. So, I do think we need some kind of stick.”</p>
<p>Prior to Gov. Hochul withdrawing her “New York Housing Compact,” a group of Westchester business organizations sent a letter to the Westchester State Delegation urging them that incentives alone will not solve the housing crisis in Westchester County and therefore lawmakers should enact some key facets of Gov. Hochul’s “New York Housing Compact” plan.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by: John T. Cooney Jr., Executive Director, Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc.; Jan Fisher, Executive Director, Nonprofit Westchester; Tim Foley, CEO, Building and Realty Institute of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region; Jana Currier, Interim CEO and COO, Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors; and Michael N. Romita, President and CEO, Westchester County Association.</p>
<p>Noting the recently released one-house budget proposals by the Assembly and Senate offered incentives to foster needed housing development and an increase in infrastructure spending as compared to Gov. Hochul’s plan, the business groups noted in the letter: “We have consistently advocated for setting clear housing growth targets (including transit-oriented development) coupled with consequences for not meeting those targets. Incentives alone will not succeed.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>The Banking Crisis, Commercial Real Estate, the Debt Ceiling, Fears of Recession</h2>
<p>In January and February, the stock market had rebounded nicely from a difficult 2022, and while interest rates remained at elevated levels, they were off of the highs reached in November. Both the stock market and real estate market seemed to stabilize somewhat and, while it was evident that the growth experienced in 2020 and 2021 would not be matched, 2023 started off in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Two of the major headwinds, at the time, facing the economy and the real estate market were the continued high rate of inflation, which was on a steady downtrend from its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, and the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates. There was little discussion or concern about the debt ceiling debate. Fears of recession had also subsided a bit, and many were of the opinion that if there was going to be a recession, it would be a mild one and the market would experience a “soft landing”.</p>
<p>On March 10th, however, everything changed. Silicon Valley Bank, a San Francisco-based bank with more than $200 billion in assets, which focused primarily on lending to start-ups and venture capital funding, literally collapsed overnight and was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the days and weeks that followed, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank were also closed and seized by the FDIC, leaving the entire banking system, particularly the regional banking system, extremely fragile and vulnerable. The positive sentiment that had begun to take hold at the beginning of the year quickly dissipated.</p>
<p><strong>The Collapse of Regional Banks: SVB and Signature Bank</strong></p>
<p>At the time, the collapse of SVB was the second largest bank collapse (overtaken by First Republic in May) in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual Bank’s failure during the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis. This collapse was primarily due to a “bank run” induced by fear (and the higher interest rate environment), which caused depositors to withdraw more than $42 billion from the bank within hours. The speed with which depositors withdrew their money from SVB was unprecedented. Unlike “bank runs” of the past, where customers remained in long lines for hours and days, these withdrawals were made from smartphones and computers instantaneously.</p>
<p>This new modern day “bank run” forced SVB to sell low-yield treasury bonds that had not yet matured, at a significant loss (due in part to one of the fastest and most aggressive interest rate hikes in U.S. history), in order to raise the funds necessary to cover the withdrawals. According to CNBC, “The roots of SVB’s collapse stem[med] from dislocations spurred by higher rates. As startup clients withdrew deposits to keep their companies afloat in a chilly environment for IPOs and private fundraising, SVB found itself short on capital. It had been forced to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.8 billion loss.” [See https://cnb.cx/3LNohq1]. Ultimately, on March 10th, the FDIC seized SVB’s assets and the bank was closed. Two days later, on March 12th, Signature Bank, with assets of approximately $118 billion, also collapsed and was seized by the FDIC.</p>
<p>Both SVB and Signature Bank were established and well-known regional banks. However, a primary reason why these banks failed was because their businesses were focused on a “niche” customer and deposit base, which ultimately proved to be very vulnerable. According to the New York Times, “Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to start-ups, imploded…after some ill-timed financial decisions left it struggling to meet customer withdrawal requests—and just as slowing venture capital funding prompted fledging companies to tap their accounts more. Similarly, Signature became one of the few banks to welcome cryptocurrency deposits, just before the overheated industry blew up last year.”</p>
<p>Signature Bank also had a large real estate lending business, but nonetheless the “Regulators said keeping open the 24-year-old institution, which held deposits from law firms and real estate companies, could threaten the financial system’s stability.” [See https://nyti.ms/3HTcS6Q]. In both instances, the regulators, invoking emergency powers, stated that all of SVB’s and Signature Bank’s customers’ deposits would be fully protected which provided some stability to a market which, in a matter of days, was shaken to its core.</p>
<p><strong>The Contagion of Fear: The Failure of First Republic Bank</strong></p>
<p>On May 1st, First Republic Bank became the latest casualty of the loss of faith in the regional banking sector stemming from the collapse of SVB. The FDIC offered the assets of First Republic for sale and JP Morgan Chase emerged as the winning bidder and acquired the bank’s deposits and substantially all of its assets. CNBC reported that “Like SVB, which catered to the tech startup community, First Republic was also a California-based specialty lender of sorts. It focused on serving rich coastal Americans, enticing them with low-rate mortgages in exchange for leaving cash at the bank.” [See https://cnb.cx/42J2LcG]. Similar to SVB, First Republic also experienced a “bank run,” and on April 24th, its quarterly earnings report revealed that more than $100 billion had been withdrawn by customers.</p>
<p>One key difference with the sale of assets of First Republic to JP Morgan Chase, was that the regulators did not make the same affirmative statement they made in connection with the SVB and Signature Bank failures—that all deposits would be protected if other banks failed. While the result was basically the same (i.e., that JP Morgan Chase would be taking over and guaranteeing all of the customers’ deposits), the lack of an affirmative assurance from regulators that all deposits would be insured and guaranteed, regardless of amount, if another regional bank failed, has left the market jittery. Another negative result from the JP Morgan Chase deal was that all of the First Republic’s shareholders (invariably including employees who received stock in employee retirement and stock option plans) lost their entire investment.</p>
<p><strong>Failing to Raise the Debt Ceiling and the Effect of a Default</strong></p>
<p>Another major issue facing the U.S. and the market is the potential of a default. The United States has never defaulted in its history and such a default would immediately send the economy into recession. According to the White House, “History is clear that even getting close to a breach of the U.S. debt ceiling could cause significant disruptions to financial markets that would damage the economic conditions faced by households and businesses.” [See https://bit.ly/41mDdRI]. The real estate industry will also be directly affected by any default or even the threat of a default.</p>
<p>If there is a short-term default, the White House, Moody’s, states that it could lead to a decline in real GDP and nearly two million jobs could be lost. The White House also predicts that the unemployment rate could increase to 5% and “could lead to lastingly higher interest costs.” A short-term default would have a significant impact on real estate and lending, which have already been severely restricted in light of the tightening credit market resulting from the failures in the regional banking sector.</p>
<p>The Council of Economic Advisors predicts that if there is a protracted default, there would be a severe recession similar to the Great Recession. The White House states that by the third quarter of 2023, the stock market could plummet 45%, which would severely affect retirement accounts. Consumer and business confidence would also take a substantial hit and lead to a decline in consumption and investment. They predict that in a protracted default, the unemployment rate could increase by an additional five percentage points as employers lay off employees, ultimately leading to a potential loss of eight million jobs.</p>
<p><strong>The Effect of High Interest Rates, Banking Crisis And Debt Default on The Real Estate Market</strong></p>
<p>All of these headwinds are clearly having an effect on the commercial and residential real estate markets. According to an article published by <em>Attom</em>, the equity owners have in their homes has fallen in the first quarter of 2023, albeit a small percentage (i.e., 47.2%) as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 (at 48%). Attom reports that “While that remained close to twice the level of just three years ago, the drop-off in the first three months of 2023 marked the second straight quarterly decline following 10 consecutive gains.” [See https://bit.ly/41w3IV2].</p>
<p>Redfin reported that “The median U.S. home sale price fell 3.3% in March to $400,528, the largest year-over-year drop since 2012. That follows February’s 1.2% dip, which was the first annual decrease since 2012.” [See https://bit.ly/3MevMro]. Redfin also reported that pending home sales dropped to the lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic due to higher mortgage and softening demand amongst purchasers.</p>
<p>CNN reported that “More lenders have stiffened their standards in the wake of increasing turmoil within the banking sector,” according to the recently released Federal Reserve’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. CNN further stated those surveyed “attributed the changes in lending standards to economic uncertainty, a reduced appetite for risk, deterioration in collateral values and broader concerns about banks’ funding costs and liquidity positions, according to the Fed report. Additionally, lenders reported that they expect to tighten standards across all loan categories for the remainder of this year, citing the above concerns as well as customer withdrawals.” The commercial and residential real estate markets are clearly being affected by all of these developments. It is critical that regulators and the Federal Reserve consider all of these issues when making decision on raising rates or assisting banks and the banking system.</p>
<p>A soft commercial leasing market will also have a direct effect on tightening lending standards. The Real Deal reported the Manhattan office space market reached a record of 94 million square feet of office space available. Obviously, the aftereffects of the pandemic are still lingering, and a soft commercial market will certainly cause a further tightening of credit markets.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em>, reporting on comments made by Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR, who also serves on the Board that oversees the New York Federal Reserve, noted that there “is $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate debt set to mature in the next three years….” Rechler tweeted that “The bulk of this debt was financed when base interest rates were near zero. This debt needs to be refinanced in an environment where rates are higher, values are lower, and in a market with less liquidity.” [See https://reut.rs/3nG2XLb]. Mr. Rechler is “calling for a program that provides lenders the leeway and the flexibility from regulators to work with borrowers to develop responsible, constructive refinancing plans.” He noted that “If we fail to act, we risk a systemic crisis with our banking system and particularly the regional banks, which make up 80% of RE lending. There will be pressure on our municipalities, which derive over 70% of their tax revenues from property taxes.” He noted that the aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will ultimately result in “breaking” the financial sector.</p>
<p><strong>What Will Happen Now?</strong></p>
<p>It is not an easy task to navigate through this economic obstacle course. There are clearly causes for concern. It is during these times of difficulty when we must resort to careful consideration of the path to take. Many of the obstacles outlined above are things individuals have no control over, but personal choices are critical to ensuring that one makes it through the turmoil.</p>
<p>No one could have foreseen a “bank run” taking place within hours, where nearly $48 billion was withdrawn from a single bank. It is truly frightening that something like that could take place. The fear that took over customers of SVB, in the weeks and months which followed, became a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to other bank runs and the failure of several more banks. Confidence in our systems is critical to survival, and it begins with those in charge. Our government officials, regulators, and lawmakers need to promote confidence in the system and assure the public that they will do everything in their power to ensure that our economic and financial system does not fail.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With the COVID-19 pandemic mostly in the rearview mirror, but economic headwinds on the horizon in 2023, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> thought it would be a good time to sit down with Westchester County Executive George Latimer to discuss some of the key issues the county is facing.</p>
<p>Latimer, a veteran politician, is in the final two-and-a-half years of his second and final term of office. He won re-election for a second term of office, but in 2019 proposed and in July 2020 signed a bill into law restricting County Executives to only two four-year terms of office.</p>
<p>A native of Mount Vernon, he has been a resident of Rye for approximately 30 years. The County Executive has extensive experience in both the public and private sectors. Latimer’s private sector experience spanned more than 20 years at major corporate subsidiaries of Nestle, and ITT, with on-site responsibilities for projects with AT&amp;T, IBM and Shearson Lehman.</p>
<p>He began his political career on the Rye City Council, then successfully ran for a seat on the Westchester County Board of Legislators where he served for 13 years, including from 1998 to 2001 as the first Democratic Chairman of the County Board. In 2004, he was elected to the New York State Assembly and then in November 2012 won a seat on the New York State Senate, representing the 37th District. In November 2017 he defeated incumbent Westchester County Executive Robert Astorino and won re-election over Christine Sculti in November 2021.</p>

Kathy Hochul withdrew her controversial “New York Housing Compact” as part of budget negotiations but promised to take up some of its provisions this legislative session. Do you believe there is a housing crisis in New York and in Westchester and what facets of her plan do you support and what provisions are you opposed to?</p>
<p><strong>Latimer:</strong> Well, I think there is a need for more housing and I think the key element of it is the affordability of the housing. I don’t think that is just a Westchester situation. Westchester is a major part of it because of the cost of living here, but I think it is true in other parts of the state as well. The demand for housing comes from a lot of different sources. Some of it comes from people who live in poor quality housing that want to upgrade to better quality housing and some of it is young people who leave their parents’ home. They may have gone to college and want to start their careers in this area, but they can’t afford market-rate housing. Some of it comes from people who are selling a home and want to downsize and they may have the money from the selling of the house, but the relative expense of moving into an apartment with a monthly charge that is equal to what their mortgage payment was and that it is not deductible creates a problem.</p>
<p>So, there is clearly in my mind a housing problem and she (Gov. Hochul) was right to put her finger on it and I think it is perfectly right to set a goal of what you are trying to achieve—so 3% as a goal of additional housing units across the board in the downstate area makes perfectly good sense to me. Now, I believe the goal should be aggregated countywide, in other words each community can be targeted to try and reach 3%, but it may not be possible for every community to reach 3%. It depends on the topography; it depends on issues such as infrastructure and sewage. Do you have enough sewage capacity? And when you talk about things like Transit-Oriented Development, take a place like Pound Ridge, which has no train station that goes through it. … To me, the difficult parts of her program, and the pushback came from the suburbs in general. In Westchester the pushback is if you mandate things, you will get a negative reaction to it. … If you say you are going to allow a state body to override local zoning, you will get pushback. We certainly want to have local control over the communities that we live in. …</p>
<p>So now, the question is, is the goal admirable? It is. What is the best way to accomplish that goal? I would posit that the best way to get to it and the state has the authority to do this, is to require each of the governments—local governments of all sorts—to put together a plan. That is exactly what they did on police reform. They didn’t say “Your police reform will look like this.” You put together a plan, I put together a plan for each of the jurisdictions and we identify how we get to the 3% number. …</p>
<p>Each community has to figure out for themselves, what they would do and the state always reserves the right to review the plans. … I think Westchester County can work with the state. We can do a specific pilot program with the state alone if they want to go that way. I understand their policies have to deal with all of the counties, not just Westchester. But, my headset is Westchester and I think that in the years to come we can make progress on housing and do our share to address the affordability element of it.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> County Executive Latimer pointed out a number of municipalities, such as Scarsdale, that have topography issues that would make achieving the governor’s housing goal difficult. He also discussed possible ways to add new housing, including renovating or demolishing outdated office buildings in certain locations. He also cited Mount Vernon as an example where there is already a great density of housing units, but the city’s most urgent need is the renovation of existing substandard housing. The County Executive said the housing issues in Westchester is different than those in Nassau or Orange counties, or New York City for that matter. He also bristled at media reports that portray the suburbs as exclusionary. While the state has the means to penalize communities for non-compliance, Latimer feels that discussion of those harsh measures will only cause less cooperation from local governments and he advocates for more dialogue with municipalities on their particular housing issues.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> You recently submitted a host of environmental proposals to the County Board of Legislators and also made other announcements geared at reducing the county’s carbon footprint. How serious is the issue of climate change?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-44609" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JVP_0246.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="300" />Latimer:</strong> First of all, climate change is a legitimate concern in my mind. What it is going to take as a society, as a nation and as a world to respond to it is pretty macro. Putting on my narrow headset, there are things that we can and are doing as a county government, and we can do more. … I am not into let’s set a goal for the future and we don’t know how to get there. What have we done specifically? We have converted the bus fleet—330 buses from diesel to electric and hybrid electric. There are more hybrid electric than there are electric vehicles. We have more expensive buses and we got federal assistance in buying those buses. And now, if you stand across the street where buses come all the time on Martine Avenue, you won’t get that blast of diesel fumes. And when we talk about our concern about children with asthma and children of color with asthma, these buses serve the urban parts of the county more than the rural parts of the county and we’ve reduced the air pollution by just that alone, forget the fact that we are using less fossil fuels by having electric rather than diesel.</p>
<p>Now, we look to the next level—the infrastructure, not just for the car fleet that we are converting to electric, but for everybody everywhere and you have to have the infrastructure of charging stations so that people feel comfortable buying an electric car and that wherever they go they can find a place to charge up (their vehicles). Technology over the next few years I assume is going to create faster charging capacity than you have now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The County Executive explained that the county is intending on growing the number of electric charging stations countywide and has also put funds in this year’s county budget to assist local governments build new charging stations. He also discussed other green initiatives, including food scrap recycling and composting, as well as solar projects at county facilities and at county parks.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> One of the growing sectors of the economy in Westchester and the Hudson Valley is film/tourism. You recently announced the development of the Westchester County Tourism Recovery Plan that was supported by a federal EDA grant. Why is this effort important and what do you hope to accomplish with this initiative?</p>
<p><strong>Latimer:</strong> In each case what is common to them (tourism and film) is that people will take action that will generate revenue for Westchester County that will help us run our government without it being a source of taxation. So, it’s a non-tax revenue stream. When you get a non-tax revenue stream, then you are running your government without me having my hand in your wallet. The more we get from film fees, the more dollars we get from tourism—hotel occupancy tax, sales tax spending coming from people outside the county—the more we can run county government without increasing property taxation. On the film side, our proximity to New York City is a tremendous advantage. New York City is probably second only to Los Angeles as a capital for filming television etc. … When they want to film onsite, when they want to film in a historic little village because the storyline lends itself to that, Westchester is perfect. We have all of these different downtowns, big downtowns, small downtowns, neighborhoods, corner shots. You can film on-location and you are right outside of New York City. Yonkers has done a brilliant job, credit Yonkers for what they have done, but that represents a benefit for us (as well). …</p>
<p>Tourism is related in that it is a question of a venue being attractive. With tourism we have some built-in natural advantages—the Hudson River is a great advantage and Long Island Sound is a great advantage. We also have Lyndhurst, Van Cortland Manor, Sunnyside, Philipse Hall, Philipsburg Manor, Caramoor is a wonderful musical venue, you have Playland, which is an attractive venue and walking the Croton Aqueduct and going up to Croton Gorge to see that beautiful dam. We have places that are reasons for people to come and tour, whether it’s a day trip and eat in one of our restaurants or spend an overnight in one of our hotels, all the better. …</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> County Executive Latimer said that he believes film and tourism should be promoted on a regional level and that all neighboring counties will benefit by promoting the Hudson Valley as a region for tourism and film. He said a component of the federal grant for the tourism recovery plan involves a regional approach to tourism.</p>
<p>I think the feds are interested in seeing us help revitalize those industries most hurt by COVID—hotels and certain venues, for sure. There is still an element of the traveling public that is a little dicey because of COVID. … The feds want to see those industries come back and you can give the money to the venue or you can say, “Governments work together and come up with a plan to market the region and give people a reason to come and they (the venues) grow and you move forward with it.”</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In February 2021 the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency approved a new local hire labor policy that requires incentivized project developers hire 85% of its construction workers from the local area among other mandates. The policy has met with mixed reviews, particularly from labor unions. Is your administration looking to make any changes to the policy or do you believe it has been successful?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-44608 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JVP_0074.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="469" />Latimer:</strong> We are trying to assess the level of success. It is hard to assert whether it has been successful or a failure as an either/or situation. I think one of the things to keep in mind is that the number of projects we incent a year under the IDA (Westchester County Industrial Development Agency) is relatively small when you compare it to Yonkers and New Rochelle where almost all of the construction you see is IDA-incented in those communities. We functionally have the IDA responsibilities for the City of White Plains, Town of Greenburgh, Town of Harrison along the I-287 corridor where you get the most concentration (and Pelham). I think it is a work in progress and I know that the labor unions would obviously like us to impose a more-strict situation—you can’t get IDA funds unless you have labor unions. The development community pushes back on that. They don’t want to be told that. Their attitude is we want to do what is in the interest for us to get the project done and sometimes costs have to be kept lower.</p>
<p>The real answer is not the IDA policy. The real answer is when organized labor and the development community can get back to the table and have candid conversations and get to some agreement. And that is hard to do. … It is a work in progress. I don’t know whether we will seek to modify the policy. I think it is subject to a discussion internally with our executive team about how it is working and whether or not we think a change makes it work. … The ideal scenario is that representatives of the development community and representatives of the labor community sit down and both of them understand that they want to hammer out a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Now in your second term of office as County Executive, what are you most proud of and what do you hope to accomplish most of all in your final term of office?</p>
<p><strong>Latimer:</strong> I think one of the things I hope to accomplish is a continuation of what we started to do, which was trying to assess the value of our physical assets and upgrade them and I think we have done that—the Sprain Ridge pools, the Miller House, the North and South County Trailways, the Memorial Field project, the New Rochelle Family Court project and Playland. There are other examples out there where we have invested in capital projects to make improvements to physical plants that were ignored or had deteriorated. If I view that as something that I am proud of, then I would project ahead and say, “Where are we going with the County Center?” The County Center was last fully renovated in the late 1980s under (then County Executive) Andy O’Rourke. It needs a more substantial reformatting and not just that it needs to be upgraded and have more modern equipment for the modern meeting and the technology, but also do we do any reconfiguration of the space in order to take advantage of what is now more current state-of-the-art as compared to what it was in 1980. <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The county may also look into modernization improvements at the main terminal at Westchester County Airport, he said.</p>
<p>I think we have four straight years of reducing the tax levy, which has not happened in recent memory. … I think we have been responsible stewards and now can I maintain that to the greatest extent possible? If I can’t lower them (taxes), at least freeze them. If I can’t freeze them, at least keep them under the tax cap. If we are committed to that and we have the money to continue to make capital improvements then I think we are exactly where we want to be.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>MOUNT KISCO—After serving as Mayor of New Rochelle for nearly two decades, Noam Bramson will be leaving city government at the end of this year for the private sector. Earlier today, Sustainable Westchester announced that Mayor Bramson will take over as Executive Director of the Mount Kisco-based non-profit effective in January 2024.</p>
<p>Bramson has served as mayor for the past 18 years and spearheaded the zoning reform effort in the city that has directly led to the extensive downtown development currently underway. Sustainable Westchester, a climate action advocacy organization and provider of renewable energy, stated that Bramson was selected as executive director after an extensive search process. Interim Executive Director Jim Kuster will remain in place until Mayor Bramson completes his current term in office.</p>
<p>“Mayor Bramson’s vast experience in government and passion for leading impactful climate action initiatives will be of immense value to Sustainable Westchester as the organization continues to grow,” said Kuster, who has served as Sustainable Westchester’s Interim Executive Director since November 2022. “Under his leadership, we will strengthen and expand our innovative programming to help a broad range of municipalities meet the critical environmental and equity objectives contained in New York’s Climate Act.” Kuster replaced Nina Orville as executive director of the organization.</p>
<p>“Mayor Bramson’s demonstrated track record of building consensus, attracting investment, and prioritizing healthy environments perfectly positions him to lead Sustainable Westchester’s continued growth and expand the great results we deliver to our members,” added Sara Goddard, Board Chair of Sustainable Westchester. “We are extremely excited to welcome him aboard.”</p>
<p>Sustainable Westchester pointed to Mayor Bramson’s environmental credentials, noting that under his leadership, New Rochelle is experiencing its fastest growth in a century, serving as a regional and statewide model for environmentally-friendly, transit-oriented development. Bramson was instrumental in adopting New Rochelle’s first-ever sustainability plan, GreeNR, now undergoing a comprehensive update to emphasize resiliency and climate justice. The organization, in its announcement, also noted that Mayor Bramson has been a champion of open space expansion, including ongoing efforts to create new parkland on the Echo Bay waterfront and along the “LINC,” a reimagined Memorial Highway.</p>
<p>New Rochelle was among the first large communities in New York State to adopt the state’s Stretch Energy Code and is presently the second-highest scoring large community in the state’s Clean Energy Communities program. In addition, as one of the founding Board Members of Sustainable Westchester, Mayor Bramson helped to establish the county’s innovative Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program, with New Rochelle one of the first cities to secure clean, renewable energy through CCA.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to join Sustainable Westchester as its new Executive Director,” said Mayor Noam Bramson. “Sustainable Westchester is among the most impactful public interest organizations in our region, with a dedicated, highly-capable staff, a record of meaningful accomplishment, and a vital, growing role in helping localities, the county, and all of New York achieve ambitious climate and environmental goals. It will be a privilege to advance such an important mission, while working alongside colleagues, both in and out of government, whom I respect deeply.”</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer hailed Bramason’s appointment, stating, &#8220;Westchester is one of the state&#8217;s foremost leaders in combating climate change and Sustainable Westchester is an integral part of this work. Noam&#8217;s leadership driving New Rochelle&#8217;s sustainability efforts has been exemplary, and he will be an asset to the organization and all they are doing county-wide. We wish him the best of luck in this new endeavor.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Westchester County Office of Economic Development announced it is partnering with Sustainable Westchester to launch a Clean Energy Accelerator Program.</p>
<p>The program, which includes a Careers Working Group that recently met for the first time, convenes key stakeholders who will work together to identify the workforce needs of the clean energy sector and create strong clean energy career pathways for Westchester residents.</p>
<p>“New York State’s visionary climate objectives come with a host of unprecedented challenges and opportunities,” said Bramson. “Sustainable Westchester is uniquely suited to make the most of this pivotal moment, position our region as a positive model, strengthen partnerships with aligned organizations and advocates, and encourage effective, collaborative policy-making at all levels of government. It will be my goal to ensure that every municipality we serve has the information, tools, encouragement, and support to achieve our shared goal of a healthy, vibrant, equitable, and sustainable county.”</p>
<p>Sustainable Westchester is a hub of innovative climate tech programs and expertise designed to help local municipalities achieve greenhouse gas reduction targets mandated by New York’s landmark Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. The nonprofit organization strives to improve clean energy solutions, save municipalities and consumers’ money, and promote equity and environmental justice within the communities it serves. Its programs include Westchester Power; Community Solar; Building Decarbonization for commercial properties; Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure; EnergySmart Homes; GridRewards; and Zero Waste.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—If at first you don’t succeed, try, try and try again. A group of Republican Congressmen submitted an amendment to the federal debt ceiling agreement before the House Rules Committee to raise the SALT Cap from $10,000 to $60,000 for individual tax filers. However, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has learned that the amendment failed to pass the House Rules Committee, which approved the debt ceiling agreement by a 7-6 margin last evening (May 30).</p>
<p>The measure marked the third time so far this year area Republican lawmakers have attempted to revise or repeal the $10,000 SALT Cap imposed by the 2017 Trump Tax Act. To date, none of those efforts have resulted in either the repeal or any revision of the SALT Cap.</p>
<p>The “SALT Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act” amendment would have raised the cap for married couples to $120,000. The “SALT Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act” amendment was offered by Reps. Mike Lawler (NY-17), Nick LaLota (NY-01), and Anthony D’Esposito (NY-04). The 17th Congressional District covers all or parts of all or parts of Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, and Westchester counties. The 1st and 4th Congressional Districts cover sections of Long Island.</p>
<p>“The arbitrary cap on SALT coupled with record inflation has made the affordability crisis even worse for Hudson Valley families, and I have said from the beginning that it needs to be lifted,” said Rep. Lawler. “I’m proud to co-sponsor Rep. LaLota’s amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act (debt ceiling agreement) that lifts the cap to $60,000 for individual filers and to $120,000 for married couples filing a joint return. This amendment would eliminate the unfair penalty for the vast majority of Hudson Valley families and is a critical part of solving New York’s affordability crisis.”</p>
<p>The amendment would have raised the cap beginning after Dec. 31, 2022 and would increase the cap beginning after 2023 by the cost of living for that calendar tax year.</p>
<p>“I came to Congress promising to take every opportunity I could to restore the SALT deduction and support Long Island families. My amendment would insert the text of my SALT Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act into the Fiscal Responsibility Act, providing more tax relief for Americans and doing even more to address our federal deficit,” said Rep. LaLota. “The bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act already provides much-needed support to the American people while addressing spending, adding my legislation would take it another step in the right direction. I am hopeful that the House Rules Committee will allow my amendment to be considered on the House Floor to give Long Islanders tax relief while cutting costs down the road.”</p>
<p>“My Long Island neighbors sent me to Congress to provide meaningful tax relief to local families, and one way I have been fighting to deliver that relief is by removing the current SALT cap,” said Rep. D’Esposito. “I am proud to join my colleague, Congressman Nick LaLota, in introducing an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act that would effectively restore the SALT cap to pre-2017 levels for the vast majority of Americans. Including the text of the SALT Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act as an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act strengthens this sweeping bipartisan deficit reducing legislation and provides added financial relief to Americans.”</p>
<p>Rep. Lawler, shortly after first taking office in January, began efforts to amend or repeal the SALT Cap. In late January, Rep. Lawler and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), a Democrat, announced they had introduced the “Middle-Class Tax Relief Act,” that they said would provide significant relief from the unfair double taxation of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to millions of families and eliminate one of the most significant marriage penalties in the tax code.</p>
<p>The legislation would have raised the cap on SALT deductions from $10,000/household to $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married couples.</p>
<p>In April, 2023, Rep. Lawler was one of the “co-leads” of a bill introduced by Rep. Andrew R. Garbarino (NY-02) entitled “The Securing Access to Lower Taxes by ensuring (SALT) Deductibility Act” announced at a press conference on Long Island alongside fellow New York members and co-sponsors of the legislation, Representatives Anthony D&#8217;Esposito (R-NY-04) and Nick Lalota (R-NY-01).</p>
<p>The bipartisan bill would have allowed taxpayers to fully deduct their state and local taxes on their federal income returns. Other co-leads of the legislation were: Rep. Lawler and Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-05), Young Kim (R-CA-40), Anna Eshoo (D-CA-16), Chris Smith (R-NJ-04), Brad Schneider (D-IL-10) and Rob Menendez (D-NJ-08).</p>
<p>In addition to the co-leads, original cosponsors of the bill include Representatives Anthony D&#8217;Esposito (R-NY-04), Marc Molinaro (R-NY-19), Pat Ryan (D-NY-18), Tom Kean Jr. (R-NJ-07), Eric Swalwell (D-CA-14), Grace Meng (D-NY-06), Joe Morelle (D-NY-25), Sean Casten (D-IL-06), Dean Phillips (D-MN-03), Paul Tonko (D-NY-20), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-18), Betty McCollum (D-MN-04), Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ-12), Jake Auchincloss (D-MA-04), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL-08), Bill Foster (D-IL-11), Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR-01), Linda Sanchez (D-CA-38), Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ-11), Andy Kim (D-NJ-03), Nick LaLota (R-NY-01), Mike Levin (D-CA-49), Jamie Raskin (D-MD-08), Jared Huffman (D-CA-02), Danny Davis (D-IL-07), Jimmy Gomez (D-CA-34), Judy Chu (D-CA-28), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC- At-Large), Jimmy Panetta (D-CA-19), Julia Brownley (D-CA-26), and Jerry Nadler (D-NY-12).</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—At a press conference on May 31, Westchester County Executive George Latimer signed legislation into law that will create an agency that will provide legal counsel to income-eligible tenants and occupants facing eviction or other housing-related matters. A housing advocacy organization stated that 93% of landlords are represented by counsel in eviction proceedings in Westchester County, while only 7% of tenants have legal representation.</p>
<p>The new law creates the Office of Housing Counsel located within the Department of Social Services for the establishment of a county-wide program to provide access to legal services for a person whose household income is at or below 300% of the federal poverty guidelines or 60% of the county Average Medium Income who has legal standing in a covered proceeding.</p>
<p>A covered proceeding is defined by the county as any proceeding in any court in the county or any administrative agency administering housing programs which involves: the eviction of a covered individual; challenges to rent increases based upon a landlord’s failure to provide proper notice; maintaining or restoring a covered individual’s occupancy of a residential rental premises; possession of a residential premises for the non-payment of rent or a holdover; restoration or maintenance of essential services and a proceeding which would result in the termination of tenancy, rental subsidy, or other rental assistance.</p>
<p>“Housing is a necessity. Plain and simple,” Westchester County Executive Latimer said. “This legislation will help Westchester residents who are facing hardships remain in their homes, easing the burden on our social services and lowering the number of our neighbors facing a crisis in their living situations. I commend the Board of Legislators for their work on this trailblazing legislation here in Westchester.”</p>
<p>The legal services provided to covered individuals will be at no cost to the clients. Additionally, community engagement and education to inform tenants of their ability to access legal counsel will be undertaken to help residents learn about this important program, county officials stated.</p>
<p>According to the 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, New York State has the highest rate of homelessness in the country, with 92,000 New Yorkers experiencing homelessness. Even worse, in a 2016 report by Stout Risius Ross, a staggering 1.2 million households are behind on rent and landlords are actively trying to evict more than 236,000 tenants statewide. According to the Right to Counsel NYC Coalition, 220,000 evictions are pending in New York courts, including town, village, and justice courts.</p>
<p>Currently, low-income tenants in Westchester County do not have guaranteed access to legal counsel in eviction proceedings. Across the state an overwhelming majority of landlords are represented during eviction proceedings, whereas most tenants are not. According to the Westchester County Right to Counsel Coalition, in normal years, when more than 10,000 eviction proceedings are filed in Westchester County Courts, 93% of landlords are represented by counsel, while only 7% of tenants have attorneys. Programs that provide legal counsel at no cost to low-income tenants, have proven to be very successful at preventing evictions and protecting tenants&#8217; rights</p>
<p>The bill reached the County Executive’s desk after being unanimously passed by the Westchester County Board of Legislators.</p>
<p>Board of Legislators Chairman Vedat Gashi said, “At the Board of Legislators, we are always looking for ways to improve the lives of the residents of Westchester. This legislation does just that. I thank my colleagues on the Board for their diligent work, the County Executive and his staff for their efforts to bring this to fruition and I look forward to working with the dedicated County staff on its implementation.”</p>
<p>Legislator Catherine Borgia said, “This law sets a gold standard for access to housing counsel. Once the office is in operation, tenants will have access to brief legal representation or full legal representation on a host of housing matters, including eviction proceedings, landlord’s failure to provide proper notice of rent increase, maintaining or restoring essential services to the tenant, among others. Even before the pandemic, it was obvious that housing costs were too high, causing economic strain for Westchester families and harming local economies. In 2019, I spent time in several local courts and I saw how unrepresented tenants were outmatched in court. The end of the pandemic-era eviction moratorium has created a huge jump in eviction proceedings, increasing risk of homelessness for families already struggling with high costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legal Services of the Hudson Valley CEO Rachel Chazin Halperin, Esq. added, “This monumental legislation puts Westchester in a small but growing category of progressive jurisdictions across the country that recognizes providing counsel to tenants effectively prevents homelessness. We are grateful to the thoughtful and bold leadership of the County Executive and Board of Legislators for passing and signing this bill and look forward to working collaboratively with them in its implementation. As the only provider of comprehensive civil legal services to low-income residents in Westchester County, the majority of our cases involve housing instability. Now with this legislation, tenants will have the benefit of counsel to assert their legal rights when the basic human right of housing is in jeopardy.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ChatGPT, Chatsonic, BingChat, YouChat. No, these are not social media sites where you chat about your favorite recipes or movies. These are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot sites where a person can enter a query and have a response generated by the computer, culling information from the vastness of the Internet. The results are human-like e-mails, essays, stories and pretty much anything else that a human can create, but it’s done by a computer.</p>
<p>In the fast-paced and competitive world of real estate, professionals are constantly seeking ways to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and deliver exceptional results. With the advent of AI, real estate professionals now have access to innovative tools that can enhance and optimize their workflow, including creating listings, marketing materials and other documents. However, it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating AI into these crucial aspects of the real estate industry. This article explores the pros and cons of using AI for real estate professionals and 95% of it, including this introduction, was written primarily by AI as an experiment (see my additional comments at the end).</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time and Cost Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>AI-powered tools can automate time-consuming tasks associated with creating property listings, marketing materials and other documents. These tools can generate professional and accurate content at a fraction of the time it would take a human professional. This efficiency translates into cost savings for real estate professionals who can allocate their time and resources to other critical areas of their business.</p>
<p><strong>Tailored Marketing and Personalization</strong></p>
<p>AI can analyze vast amounts of data, such as property features, location, demographics and buyer preferences to generate personalized marketing materials. By leveraging AI, real estate professionals can create marketing campaigns that resonate with buyers, increasing the likelihood of attracting buyers and expediting a sale.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Customer Engagement</strong></p>
<p>AI empowers real estate professionals to provide instant, personalized assistance to potential buyers, sellers, landlords and renters. The AI model can handle numerous queries simultaneously, ensuring prompt responses and reducing the need for human intervention. By integrating AI into websites, real estate companies can enhance customer engagement and offer round-the-clock support, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Property Search Experience</strong></p>
<p>AI-powered algorithms can analyze large datasets and extract valuable insights to assist clients in finding their ideal properties. AI can understand natural language queries and provide relevant property recommendations based on specific requirements, preferences and budgets. This feature simplifies the property search process, saving time and effort for both real estate professionals and customers.</p>
<p><strong>Automating Routine Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Real estate professionals often spend a considerable amount of time on repetitive administrative tasks. AI can automate many of these processes, such as generating property listings, scheduling appointments and sending personalized notifications. By freeing up time previously dedicated to administrative duties, real estate professionals can focus on higher-value activities, such as building client relationships and closing deals.</p>
<p><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of real estate data, including market trends, property prices and demographic information. By utilizing this wealth of information, real estate professionals can make more informed decisions regarding property valuation, investment opportunities and market predictions. Data-driven insights provided by AI can help professionals stay ahead of the competition and increase their chances of success.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing Compliance</strong></p>
<p>AI can help real estate agents comply with fair housing laws by flagging potential discriminatory language or practices in listings and marketing materials. It can provide agents with real-time feedback and suggestions to ensure they adhere to the principles of fair housing, promoting equal opportunities for all.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lack of Human Touch and Intuition</strong></p>
<p>AI tools, while efficient, lack the human touch and intuition that real estate professionals possess. The emotional aspect of property descriptions or marketing messages might be challenging for AI algorithms to replicate accurately. Real estate professionals must strike a balance between AI automation and personalized human involvement to maintain authentic and engaging interactions with clients.</p>
<p><strong>Legal and Ethical Considerations</strong></p>
<p>AI-generated documents must still comply with applicable laws and regulations. Real estate professionals need to carefully review and verify the output of AI systems to ensure legal compliance and protect their clients&#8217; interests. Additionally, ethical considerations arise when using AI algorithms to analyze personal data for targeted marketing. Striking a balance between leveraging data and respecting privacy is crucial to maintain trust with clients.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Investment and Learning Curve</strong></p>
<p>Integrating AI tools for creating listings or marketing materials requires an initial investment in technology, training and infrastructure. Training the model to understand industry-specific terminology and optimizing its performance may also require additional resources and expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Bias</strong></p>
<p>AI systems learn from historical data, which may contain biased information that perpetuates unfair practices (i.e., fair housing). If AI algorithms are not carefully designed and monitored, they can inadvertently perpetuate discrimination and this could lead to legal and ethical issues.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Analysis (My Personal Observations of AI in My Own Words)</strong></p>
<p>As you have read, AI did a pretty good job in following instructions and culling information in a straightforward type of fashion, however, its style can often be stilted and boring. You can “jazz it up” by asking AI to write in a certain style (example: haiku, Hemingway, Old English), but the substance comes from the Internet.</p>
<p>In preparing this article, I had to do some heavy revisions, major redactions, and noted that some of the information was simply wrong. For example, at numerous points, the program referenced that AI was good for drafting legal documents, contracts and similar binding agreements. This is, obviously, wrong. Real estate agents should never be drafting any legal document. Also, what the program failed to take note of was that our MLS has a vast amount of information relating to properties in our area, but it’s not on the Internet. This means that the information provided by AI could be extremely inaccurate because it does not have the access to it. This information is only available to Realtors, but not AI.</p>
<p>Other issues I came across were, while the program did note there could be biases that are perpetuated unless properly trained, presently, AI would not recognize certain fair housing pitfalls, such as “walk to worship,” “great home for seniors,” “no dogs” (what about service animals?), or “not child-friendly.” As such, it could inadvertently steer certain groups toward or away from properties, in violation of fair housing laws. It could expose Realtors to possible DOS advertising and Article 12 violations (truthfulness in advertising) or Article 2 violations (misrepresentations). Further, with regard to privacy, AI might collect and store data about users, including potentially confidential information. Such information could be exposed if not properly protected. Additionally, copyright law is unclear about whether the words that are spit out onto the page are copyrightable and who would own the copyright (the user, the designer, someone else?). The law has yet to catch up to AI.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While there are some great benefits to AI, there are some serious issues as well. None of these are going away any time soon and AI is here to stay. If you are going to use AI, be mindful of the following:</p>
<p>• Always review AI-generated content for accuracy and suitability.</p>
<p>• Review content for possible fair housing violations and bias, particularly regarding property or community descriptions.</p>
<p>• Consider using AI to gather ideas and concepts, and then craft your own material from it.</p>
<p>• Do not use AI for work you wish to copyright.</p>
<p>• Ensure you have consent to use any third-party material generated by AI, including pictures, and save that information.</p>
<p>AI is great. Give it a try. But be careful.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>SLEEPY HOLLOW—Organizers of the second annual Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Summit were in agreement that this year’s event, held on June 5 and 6 at the Sleepy Hollow Hotel &amp; Conference Center here, featured a wide-ranged offering of programs and discussions geared at providing insights for real estate brokers, agents, as well as association boards and affiliates to ponder as they look to instill DEI practices and principles into their business and personal lives.</p>
<p>Among some of the key topics explored at The 2023 DEI Summit were the correlation between DEI and fair housing and implicit biases that continue to haunt the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Approximately 200 real estate professionals attended the 2023 DEI Summit. OneKey MLS was the premier sponsor. The hosts for the event were: the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, the National Association of Realtors, the New York State Association of Realtors, New Jersey Realtors, North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, the Greater Rochester Association of Realtors and the Greater Bergen (NJ) Realtors.</p>
<p>The summit began on June 5 with a Two-Hour NY CE Course entitled “Unmanaged Bias Limits Leadership” taught by HGAR DEI Officer Freddimir Garcia. A Networking Reception followed the conclusion of the class.</p>
<p>On June 6, the day began with welcoming addresses by 2023 NYSAR President elect Jacqueline Rose, and Robert White, 2023 Immediate Past President, New Jersey Realtors. The morning keynote speaker was Deanna Singh, Chief Change Agent and best-selling author whose presentation was entitled “Actions Speak Louder.”</p>
<p>Summit attendees then had the option to attend one of three topical breakout sessions—&#8221;The Community in People” panel was moderated by Nan Palumbo, HGAR YPN Chair and featured Soo Yu, AAREA; Christopher Cortez, NAHREP and Donnell Williams, NAREB. Leslie Frazier, Senior Vice President of Community and Industry Relations of the Virginia Realtors, led a discussion on “Dealing with Difficult Conversations, while Brennon Thompson, Analyst, Fair Housing Policy &amp; Programs at the National Association of Realtors, moderated a panel that featured former NYSAR President Jennifer Vucetic, HGAR Past President Anthony Domathoti and Jorge Ledesma, CEO, Greater Bergen Realtors.</p>
<p>The morning program concluded with a panel discussion moderated by Teresa Tilton, Director of Professional Services, New Jersey Realtors, entitled “Increase Generational Wealth Building for Black &amp; Hispanic Homeowners” that focused primarily on Freddie Mac programs and other affordable housing finance solutions.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Keynote speaker was best-selling author Kelly McDonald who offered tangible recommendations on “How to Make Progress on DE&amp;I in Your Organization.”</p>
<p>The afternoon breakout sessions included a “Realtor Safety &amp; Racism” panel moderated by Alexia Smokler, Director of Fair Housing Policy &amp; Programs at NAR, that featured riveting and sometimes frightening personal examples of discrimination shared by Bill Flagg, the 2022 President of the North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, and Realtor Eric Brown. Session attendees were riveted by Brown, a black Realtor, who recounted an incident in August 2021 when he and several clients on a home tour were mistakenly handcuffed by Michigan police who mistook them for burglars. Brown noted that while he and his clients were eventually released and not arrested, several officers had their guns drawn before he proved to police that he was in fact a licensed Realtor legally showing the home to prospective clients.</p>
<p>The second breakout session “Intent vs Impact: Tackling Microaggressions” was led by HGAR’s DEI Officer Garcia. The third breakout session covered “Building a DEI Committee” and was led by Anthony Ruperto, HGAR DEI Committee Chair.</p>
<p>The Closing Keynote Speaker was M. Ryan Gorman, Co-Founder/Unmanageable Partner, btcRE, LLC, who closed the two-day seminar with a presentation entitled: “DE&amp;I Leadership Lessons Learned.”</p>
<p>Event sponsors were pleased with the increased attendance at the 2023 DE&amp;I Summit and expressed their intent to stage and participate in a summit in 2024.</p>
<p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica said, “I am really happy with the way the summit turned out. I am especially happy with the collaboration that we have been able to continue with our Realtor associations in New Jersey and Upstate New York. I do believe this is a conversation we have to have. It reflects what our Realtor values are and together as a group with associations in the entire region, we should be spreading the message to all our members, not just to one select group.”</p>
<p>HGAR Past President Domathoti, who led the HGAR efforts at the first DEI Summit held in 2022 in Mahwah, NJ, said of the 2023 summit, “It is a significant event in the calendar of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the participating associations. It is about time that all the agencies and associations are recognizing the need for DE&amp;I and this event is a representation of that recognition. I truly believe this event is a step forward in creating a lot more activities by associations that are inclusive of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.”</p>
<p>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, who along with Flagg, helped organize the first DEI Summit, said he was pleased with the increased attendance and enhanced program offerings at the 2023 summit.</p>
<p>Haggerty, former CEO of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, said, “I think the program has been excellent and I am happy that it has the same energy, if not more, than the inaugural DEI event last year.”</p>
<p>He added, “DEI is a process. It is a journey and we have to commit to the journey and it doesn’t happen overnight and it will probably never reach a final destination, but we have to make as much progress as we can while we are going along on that journey.”</p>
<p>Haggerty added that the first two summits have been a “tremendous success” due to the fact that they have been and will continue to be a collaborative effort involving so many associations ·</p>
<p>Haggerty, as well as HGAR’s D’Anzica and Domathoti, all said they are committed to staging a DEI Summit next year.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TOWN OF WALLKILL—Officials with the New York State Department of Transportation held a public hearing here on June 1 to update the public on its re-evaluation of planned improvements to Exit 122 on Route 17. They also provided an update on the environmental review of the possible expansion of sections of the roadway with a third lane in each direction from Harriman to Monticello.</p>
<p>The takeaway from their presentation is that there will be considerable road work beginning early next year at Exit 122 of Route 17 and on sections of the highway in late 2025 or early 2026 and for years thereafter, perhaps as far out as 2029 or 2030, as NYSDOT follows through on a $1-billion commitment for Route 17 improvements first announced by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in April 2022. The total value of the projects outlined by NYSDOT officials at Exit 122 and on three major projects to be let in 2026 approach that $1-billion figure.</p>
<p>Mark Tiano, PE, NYSDOT Regional Design engineer and Mark Kruk, NYSDOT Project Manager, said that the second phase involving improvements to the eastern half of Exit 122 interchange is currently valued at between $75 million to $85 million. While the final design has not been completed as yet, NYSDOT also intends to have the project complete the widening of Route 17 over the Wallkill River. The first phase of the Exit 122 improvement project was launched in the early 2000s and construction on the western half of the Exit 122 interchange was completed in 2015.</p>
<p>Kruk added, “We are currently doing a reevaluation of the 2008 Environmental Impact Statement. Once we complete the reevaluation then we are going to move into the final design. We will be done with the final design by the end of the year.”</p>
<p>He predicted that the second phase of the Exit 122 project will go out to bid in the spring of 2024 with construction commencing immediately thereafter, most likely in the summer of 2024. Kruk said he expects completion of that project by the end of 2025.</p>
<div id="attachment_44833" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44833" class="wp-image-44833" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230601_182550.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-44833" class="wp-caption-text">From left, Mark Tiano, PE, NYSDOT Regional Design Engineer, and Mark Kruk, PE, NYSDOT Project Manager</p></div>
<p>Among some of the key improvements planned will be to relocate the exit ramp to across from the Park and Ride on Crystal Run Road and have the new exit ramp split to allow for direct entrance to I-84. In addition, the bridge over the Wallkill River at the approach to the exit will be widened to allow for increased deceleration in conformance with federal interstate standards as part of an effort to eventually convert Route 17 into Interstate 86. The project will feature a tunnel to improve traffic flow as well as landscaping of the area around the existing Exit 122 ramp.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Route 17</strong></p>
<p>In terms of the much more significant Route 17 expansion project, Kruk related that preliminary work began earlier this year in preparation for the official launch of an Environmental Impact review on what is projected to be $1 billion worth of improvements in the coming years. A Notice of Intent is expected to be released this fall on the beginning of the environmental review in compliance with federal NEPA regulations since the project will be receiving federal transportation funding. NYSDOT began gathering data for that review earlier this year, which will update a PEL (Planning and Environmental Linkage) study on the need for the Route 17 expansion (third lane) project released in late 2021.</p>
<p>He explained that while the PEL study included some environmental data, NYSDOT, along with consulting firm WSP USA, will be undertaking new traffic studies, etc. during the Environmental Impact review. Kruk expects a Record of Decision on the Environmental Review and the scope of the potential roadway expansion project in the fall of 2025. WSP USA is also one of the consulting firms working on the Exit 122 phase two project.</p>
<p>“The plan is, once we have a Record of Decision with the EIS, is to move forward with three Design-Build projects hopefully immediately thereafter,” Kruk said.</p>
<p>Work on those three projects would likely commence in either late 2025 or early 2026, coinciding with the conclusion of work on the second phase of the Exit 122 job. He said that the project worth for each of those three projects could be anywhere from $250 million to $300 million each.</p>
<p>Kruk did not specify what those three Design-Build projects might entail or their locations. “We are looking at alternatives,” Mr. Kruk said. “It is not definite it is going to be an expansion. We are looking at where the expansion works and where it doesn’t work. So, we are looking at all those different alternatives.”</p>
<p>Daniel Ortega, community affairs director, Operating Engineers Local 835 Labor-Management Fund and a member of the 17-Forward-86 coalition that has been advocating for years in favor of the Route 17 expansion, said: “We are very grateful for the governor’s commitment to the Hudson Valley where she put $1 billion in her budget last year to make sure that the Route 17 project will move forward with three lanes for Orange and Sullivan counties.” Ortega, who attended the Exit 122 public hearing, added, “We are working with DOT and have been working with them over the years to make sure things are moving forward.”</p>
<p>Ortega said that the planned improvements to the Exit 122 (Crystal Run Road) is part of NYSDOT’s commitment to improve Route 17 and is a precursor to the large-scale improvements to the roadway in the coming years.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, co-founder of the 17-Forward-86 coalition, said, “Projects of this caliber take years to plan and execute and while stakeholders have been waiting for a long time, it is heartening to see that the state is focused on laying out the plan to complete this project in the upcoming years.” Ms. Halahan, who is President and CEO of The Orange County Partnership, added, “Our 17-Forward-86 coalition has been the driver since inception and clearly the forward motion is a result of everyone working together with the state. The proof is in the first launch as the bid for the Exit 122 project will be let early next year and the work will begin immediately after. The governor’s commitment to this project has been steadfast. Everyone is working in tandem to see these vital projects on Route 17 break ground.”</p>
<p>Heather M. Pillsworth, Public Information Officer for NYSDOT’s Region 8, said that there will be a website specific to Route 17 that will include all information pertaining to not only the second phase of the Exit 122 project but the overall improvements to the roadway. The website should be going live shortly, she noted.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is certainly the new “new frontier” filled with all the promise and all the dangers that customarily accompany any new journey into uncharted territory or newly introduced technology. AI has taken front stage in our daily lives, and it is only the beginning. There are a multitude of articles and news stories that come out each day focusing on AI and its effect on business, education, investment, lending, real estate, manufacturing, the job market and every other aspect of our daily lives.</p>
<p>This nascent industry will undoubtedly and forever change the way people work, live, learn, educate and interact with one another. Many believe it is the next best thing to the iPhone or automobile, others believe it could possibly be the most dangerous invention since the development of the atomic bomb. Either way, it is an important technology that must be understood, developed, controlled and above all, utilized in a careful and thoughtful manner. While AI is a technology that has been in development for decades, it has gained more recent notoriety with the advent of ChatGPT introduced by OpenAI [see <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://openai.com</a>]. This article will delve into the promise and perils of AI.</p>
<p><strong>A Primer: Predictive AI vs. Generative AI</strong></p>
<p>In an article entitled <em>“Predictive AI vs. Generative Ai: Unveiling the Distinction</em>,” author Ishan Kapoor states there are two distinct branches of AI that have emerged [see <a href="https://bit.ly/42GmklA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/42GmklA</a>]. Kapoor explains that “Predictive AI systems are designed to forecast outcomes based on historical data patterns and existing information. These models rely on machine learning algorithms to identify trends, correlations and statistical patterns in data sets. By analyzing vast amounts of historical data, predictive AI can make accurate predictions and estimations about future events.” These traditional AI systems are more akin to the traditional search engine and search engine optimization (SEO) uses (e.g., Google, Amazon, YouTube, etc.).</p>
<p>Kapoor points out the importance of Predictive AI when it comes to marketing, as it “enables businesses to anticipate consumer behavior, optimize advertising campaigns, and identify potential leads. Predictive AI algorithms can be trained to forecast customer preferences, predict market trends and provide valuable insights for decision-making.” This form of AI can be extremely important in the real estate industry when it comes to locating specific properties, identifying trends in particular areas and marketing those properties to potential customers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kapoor explains that Generative AI “focus[es] on the creation of new and original content. It employs sophisticated algorithms to generate novel outputs that mimic human-like creativity. By learning from large datasets, generative AI models can generate text, images, music, and even videos that exhibit a high level of authenticity.” He points out that “One of the most notable applications of generative AI is in the field of content creation.” Generative AI can assist with writing, designing, web-development, marketing, producing art and other artistic content, and the list can go on and on. With Generative AI the possibilities are endless and as Kapoor so eloquently states, “It pushes the boundaries of human imagination and offers creative possibilities that were previously unexplored.” However, it must also be carefully developed and utilized, and safeguards must be put in place.</p>
<p><strong>The Pitfalls and Dangers of AI</strong></p>
<p>Brian Levine, Esq., HGAR’s General Counsel, in his monthly column in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> shows how AI could be used to generate portions of an article [see <a href="https://bit.ly/43SIMZR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/43SIMZR</a>]. He details the pros and cons real estate practitioners should consider when using AI technology in their business. Levine points out the pitfalls when utilizing AI and stresses the importance of assessing the legal and ethical considerations when deciding to use this new technology in connection with everyday business operations. He also stresses that AI technology, which “learns” from historical data and garners information from vast amounts of data and databases that exist on the Internet, could “contain biased information that perpetuates unfair practices (i.e., fair housing).” That is why it is extremely important to exercise discretion when deciding to implement AI technology and include it in your business.</p>
<p><strong>AI, Copyright Issues &amp; the NAR Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors points out the new issues that are popping up in the real estate industry as a result of the increased use of AI. Christina Hoffman, in her article entitled “<em>AI Use in Real Estate Comes with Copyright Concerns</em>” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3MWfcvC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3MWfcvC</a>], points out that there are a number of recent cases that deal with AI-related issues. In one case, <em>Thaler v. Perlmutter</em>, a plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Copyright Office for denying his registration for an AI-generated image produced by him and his AI System, Creativity Machine, because it was not produced by a human. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3CmdbEd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3CmdbEd</a>]. In another case, <em>Getty Images (US), Inc. v. Stability AI, Ltd.</em>, Getty Images sued Stability AI for using more than 12,000 images (and its accompanying metadata) belonging to Getty to “train” its AI system. [See <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/delaware/dedce/1:2023cv00135/81407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dockets.justia.com/docket/delaware/dedce/1:2023cv00135/81407</a>].</p>
<p>NAR also points out that Realtors should be aware of the ethical concerns when using AI to promote and market properties. Chloe Hecht, Senior Counsel at NAR, stresses that Realtors should look to Articles 2 and 12 of the Realtor Code of Ethics when using AI to stage or generate images of a property, or use when they use images. Under Article 2, “REALTORS® shall avoid exaggeration, misrepresentation or concealment of pertinent facts relating to the property or the transaction.” Article 12 further provides that “REALTORS® shall be honest and truthful in their real estate communications and shall present a true picture in their advertising, marketing and other representations.”</p>
<p>Hecht provides a perfect example of crossing the line, “using AI to remove a structural crack from a wall violates those two Articles, but removing a hose and bucket accidentally caught in a picture is different.” Hoffman pointed out “three takeaways” offered by Hecht when utilizing AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always review AI-generated content for accuracy.</li>
<li>Don’t use AI to create a work you want to be able to protect.</li>
<li>Don’t assume any third-party content was created by AI and, therefore, available for your use. Always get permission in writing for the way you want to use the work, and save that documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ChatGPT and AI: Still in its Early Stages</strong></p>
<p>Recently, in a well-publicized <em>New York Times</em> article [see <a href="https://nyti.ms/3p4YF0j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nyti.ms/3p4YF0j</a>], an attorney utilized ChatGPT to prepare a court motion for a personal injury lawsuit, which “was filled with fake judicial opinions and legal citations.” The lawsuit involved a passenger who was injured by a meal cart on a flight. The airline requested the judge to dismiss the lawsuit because the statute of limitations had expired. The plaintiff’s attorneys submitted a 10-page motion citing cases in support of their position that the lawsuit should be allowed to move forward. When the airline’s attorneys asked for copies of the cases cited in the motion, the attorneys for the passenger could not come up with them as they did not exist.</p>
<p>The attorney who used ChatGPT to prepare the motion has been practicing law in New York for more than 30 years and who is now faced with certain disciplinary action. The attorney told the judge that he never used ChatGPT before and had learned about it from his children and articles that he had read. He explained to the judge that he did not understand the limitations of ChatGPT “and could not comprehend that ChatGPT could fabricate cases.” The authors of the <em>New York Times </em>article citing Stephen Gillers, an Ethics Professor at New York University Law School, stated that “The worldwide publicity spawned by the episode should serve as a warning…. ‘Paradoxically, this event has an unintended silver lining in the form of deterrence.’” This event stresses the importance of becoming knowledgeable about any new technology before utilizing it and understanding its limitations as well as its boundless potential.</p>
<p>I have also experimented with ChatGPT and realized fairly quickly that the technology is limited in what it could do. First and foremost, ChatGPT does have a disclaimer that information after September 2021 is limited. I ran a test query and requested information on certain statutes and areas of the law, and found that many references to the sections of the law that I had inquired about were not accurate or just plain wrong. I also used ChatGPT to prepare a simple escrow agreement and post-closing undertaking agreement, and while the resulting document was rather rudimentary, one could see the potential once the technology is perfected. It provided a basic form of a document that could be developed into something useful.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Estate Professional: The Use Case for AI, Now</strong></p>
<p>While it is clear that one must exercise caution when utilizing AI, there are many instances where AI can be utilized safely and effectively. According to Jimmy Burgess, in an article in <em>Inman</em>, ChatGPT is an excellent tool to increase your social media footprint. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3NqkG32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3NqkG32</a>]. He explains, “ChatGPT has so many opportunities and applications to help agents, one is assisting us with optimizing our reach on social media.” In his article, Burgess provides distinct queries that can be entered into ChatGPT to generate posts with increased SEO for the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube.</p>
<p>He also suggests that one could “compound” the content created for each of the platforms to create content for many other platforms. Burgess points out, “There are only a few generational technologies that come along with the potential to revolutionize the efficiencies in our businesses. ChatGPT is one of these generational technologies. Take advantage of it now and the early adopters will be rewarded.”</p>
<p>Jim Dalrymple II, in his article in <em>Inman</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Jb28kP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Jb28kP</a>], provides a list of invaluable resources that real estate professionals can utilize in the field of AI to increase their productivity, exposure and, ultimately, their bottom-line. He provides links and descriptions to: (1) “chatbots” (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard, Microsoft Bing); (2) “image generators” (e.g., DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DreamStudio); (3) “AI Powered Real Estate Platforms” (e.g., OJO, BHR, Restb.ai, Scout, Rezora, RESAAS, ListAssist); and (4) “Other Exotic AI Tools” (e.g., Adobe products, Eleven Labs, DI-D, Runway). These companies provide products and services that cover a wide array of AI technology and tools available to the real estate professional.</p>
<p>Inman has also made available an excellent instructional video presented by Dalrymple and Kent Czechowski entitled “How ChatGPT and AI Technology Will Impact Productivity, Creativity, and Efficiency in Real Estate” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3CnL0or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3CnL0or</a>]. The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Broker-Owner-Manager Committee and Young Professionals Network hosted an exciting event on AI on Tuesday, June 13<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>AI Technology Being Utilized by Lenders </strong><strong>And Other Real Estate Professionals</strong></p>
<p>According to an article in <em>The</em> <em>Motley Fool</em>, authored by Jeremy Bowman [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3N40sLd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3N40sLd</a>], there are five areas where AI is being utilized extensively. One is in the area of “Predictive Analytics.” He points out that both Zillow and Redfin are using AI to generate proprietary valuation estimates for properties. Another area is in “3D modeling,” where he points out that “Visual representations have become increasingly important in real estate, and it&#8217;s one of a number of industries that are taking advantage of…AI-based computer images that allow users to explore a space digitally.” Another area is the use of AI in “Smart Home Devices.”. Bowman points out that AI can be used in smart home products to monitor the home and assist with issues that may come up while a person is away. AI is also being utilized in the field of property management.</p>
<p>Another important area in which AI is being utilized with more frequency is in the mortgage industry. AI is being used by underwriters to approve borrowers much more quickly and efficiently. Bowman points out that “In underwriting, AI is used to analyze borrower information such as credit scores, income, and employment history to evaluate the borrower&#8217;s risk profile and find the best rate to charge.” AI can also assist with fraud prevention and loan servicing (e.g., assist with payment processing, customer service and support, etc.). He points out that some lenders, like Rocket Mortgage, are able to issue a loan approval within eight minutes by utilizing AI.</p>
<p><strong>The AI Frontier is Upon Us, Be Careful on the Journey</strong></p>
<p>AI is exciting and many professionals have set out on the journey with much enthusiasm. The uses for AI, in all its forms and across all industries, are limitless, however, as with all new technologies there are inherent dangers and pitfalls. Everyone must be careful when utilizing AI and be weary of the legal, ethical and societal consequences in implementing existing AI technology. We must all remember that we are at the very beginning of the AI journey, and there is still a long way to go.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3>A Modern-Day International Gypsy</h3>
<p>Christina Prostano, an Associate Broker with Compass in Manhattan, has been in the real estate business for almost 20 years, but traveled quite an eclectic career path to get there.</p>
<p>A sort of modern-day international gypsy, Prostano has enjoyed stints as a wedding band singer, an indie rock band performer, a promoter for Planet Hollywood restaurants, and a tourist book producer who has lived in London, Paris and Hong Kong. She has also traveled to almost all 50 U.S. states and visited exotic locations like Dubai, Thailand and Singapore. Prostano even spent a month in Mexico volunteering at an orphanage during her college days.</p>
<p>Today, she’s putting all of her international travel background to good use serving as the Co-Chair of HGAR’s Global Business Council and reaping the benefits of her membership with FIABCI, a worldwide business networking organization for all professionals associated with the real estate industry.</p>
<p>While she has been with Compass just a little over a year, Prostano spent 17 years with Corcoran, where she began her real estate career. She was involved in relocation consulting for many years, working with both domestic and international executives relocating to New York.</p>
<p>While she grew up in the Connecticut suburbs, Prostano has always considered herself a “city girl,” and has called Brooklyn her home since 1999. “It’s a very special market and clients will always know if you’re from Brooklyn,” she explained. “You have to know the character of the neighborhoods and which budgets will fit into which communities.”</p>
<p>A student at Fordham University in the Bronx, Prostano took to radio at WFUV on campus before breaking into theater and singing gigs. She holds an undergraduate degree in English Literature and International Studies and an M.A. in Music from New York University. “I was actually in a band in high school and then got into an indie rock band later, touring colleges and local clubs throughout the country,” she recalled. The band, Palomar, put out five albums—the last one in 2012. “We all have kids now and one of the members lives in L.A., but hopefully we’ll get together again.” Prostano has two girls, aged 13 and 15.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it was the band experience that piqued her interest in real estate. “I wanted a flexible career so I could go on tour,” she said. Plus, her parents were investors, and she witnessed their success and ability to work for themselves.</p>
<p>During her college days, Prostano also had the opportunity to be part of a service project in Mexico and volunteered her time for a month at an orphanage. “We did everything from helping out with the kids to building a new home for the older children there,” she remembered. “No one spoke English, so it was great to put what I learned in a book to real life. That actually triggered a love of languages, so I started to learn French and Italian as well.”</p>
<p>One of Prostano’s other interesting career choices was working with a British publisher producing travel discount books for vacationers in 25 cities around the world. Prostano worked on the New York, London and Paris books, spending five years in London and one year in Paris. “We had to visit various attractions and sign them up to offer a discount to tourists,” she explained. “We did everything from selling them the idea, to writing the text and publishing the book. We wore all the hats.”</p>
<p>Also along the career path was a short stint as a marketer for Planet Hollywood restaurants, where she had the opportunity to travel to places like Hong Kong for new openings.</p>
<p>A member of the Real Estate Board of New York for many years, Prostano eventually joined NAR and HGAR after meeting HGAR President Tony D’Anzica earlier at a FIABCI event. Even with her extensive background in international travel, she admits she never thought about combining that with real estate.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, she started an interview series on Instagram Live, featuring people who had moved out of New York City. After she took the series to Clubhouse, it started to garner international attention and her interview subjects grew to brokers from around the globe. “I made a lot of great connections, attended international property shows and also earned my CIPS (Certified International Property Specialist) designation. In addition, Prostano is a Crypto Certified Agent.</p>
<p>Currently, she’s working on building her Compass team—the CP Global Team—and has added a person who speaks Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>As for Prostano’s favorite global destination, it’s Italy hands down. “I have an Italian passport and we usually go somewhere there every year,” she said. “Venice is always amazing.”</p>
<p>As Co-Chair of the association’s Global Business Council, Prostano is striving to ensure that HGAR will again be honored with NAR’s Platinum Global Achievement Award, as it was last year. “Growing any business—domestic or international—is based on entrepreneurism,” she said. “To be successful in real estate, all you have to do is take it seriously and treat it as your own business.”</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>With much debate during the State Budget Fight, the State Legislature seemed ready to jog out the rest of the Legislative Session with infighting, no movement on the housing crisis and a lot still left to be done. What started as a lion of a legislative session, centered around a newly-elected governor and a plan to tackle the housing crisis, was ending as a lamb ready to go out to pasture.</p>
<p>The State Legislative Calendar can be a little hard to understand, so here is a summary:</p>
<p>Originally designed so agricultural workers could spend the second half of the year working the land and the first half of the year actively participating in state government, the New York State Legislative Session was scheduled for about six months, from January to June. In more recent times, despite having six months to legislate, State Representatives are most active in the weeks and hours before the budget is due in March and the end of session in June. Much like a senior before finals or a squirrel before winter, the halls of power in Albany are busy with much scurrying and cramming in the last week of March and final two weeks of session in June.</p>
<p>That being all said, this legislative session flow has been anything but typical. The budget fight has left our state representatives worn out and ready to leave Albany and tend to their districts as they would have tended to their farms in yesteryear. The year’s session resulted in a distinct lack of efficiency in the halls of the Capitol Building.</p>
<p>In 2023, both the New York State Assembly and Senate saw a significant drop in the number of bills passed by the legislature compared to 2022. Of the more that 15,000 bills introduced, a total of 839 bills passed both houses so far. For reference, 2022 saw 1,007 measures pass both chambers. In 2023, the State Senate also saw nearly double the amount of bills passed in their chambers compared to the Assembly. To better catch up, the Assembly will reconvene in the coming weeks to vote on bills that the Senate has already passed. The Assembly Chambers, despite having a Democratic Super Majority, are reportedly at a standstill over several issues.</p>
<p>Some of the bills that were passed take on topics such as the sealing of old criminal records, a commission to study reparations, expanding health care services for undocumented immigrants, and allowing liquor stores to sell on Sundays. Noticeably absent is any movement on the issue of the housing crisis. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s Housing Compact, which would have required municipalities to add more housing stock, has been dead for weeks. The legislature, which killed the Housing Compact, has not offered any alternative housing plan or solutions.</p>
<p>There was a concerted effort by members of the legislature to pass “Good Cause Eviction” both during budget negotiations and at the end of session. HGAR, NYSAR and a number of like-minded organizations fought hard to defeat these efforts to pass Good Cause Eviction. As of press time, there seems to be a general understanding that Good Cause Eviction is not a viable solution to the housing crisis.</p>
<p>All in all, the 2023 Legislative Session was a distracted one. The governor’s housing push and the protracted budget process left little room for Realtor topics to be discussed. It can be hard to focus on lifting the ban on solicitous phone calls when emergency budget extenders need to be passed. This Lion and Lamb Session can also be described as the stereotype of Albany—a legislative session full of infighting, late budgets and a refusal to tackle the bigger issues.</p>
<p>Just in case you were wondering, State Representatives are up for reelection next year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors announced on Jan. 20 that veteran visionary association executive Lynda Fernandez, CAE, RCE, CIPS has been named HGAR’s new Chief Executive Officer. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A new era is dawning at the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors as the search for a new Chief Executive Officer has come to an end.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors announced on June 20 that veteran visionary association executive Lynda Fernandez, CAE, RCE, CIPS has been named HGAR’s new Chief Executive Officer. The selection of Fernandez, who is currently the CEO of the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors (GLAR), culminates an extensive and comprehensive nine-month national search by HGAR.</p>
<p>Fernandez is scheduled to take her new position at HGAR on or about Sept. 1, 2023. She has more than 20 years of experience in association management, government affairs, communications and international business development. She is a Certified Association Executive (CAE), Realtor Association Certified Executive (RCE), and a Certified International Property Specialist (CIPS).</p>
<p>HGAR officials commended Jana Currier, who has served as Interim HGAR CEO since January 2023 after longtime HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty left the association to become CEO of OneKey MLS. Currier will continue to serve HGAR as Chief Operating Officer going forward once Fernandez joins HGAR.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and its predecessor associations were until recently served for more than 40 years by two outstanding CEOs. P. Gilbert Mercurio served as CEO for 31 years until 2012 and Haggerty oversaw the formation of HGAR and its expansion for a decade.</p>
<p>The HGAR Board of Directors appointed a CEO Search Committee that conducted a national search. The process for the highly-sought after post spanned several months and countless hours of intense interviews. 2023 HGAR President and Chairman of the CEO Search Committee Tony D’Anzica said the search was highly competitive, but ultimately the Search Committee unanimously agreed to recommend Fernandez to the Board of Directors for approval as the new CEO.</p>
<p>“After concluding a thoughtful, diligent and extensive nationwide search, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors is pleased to announce that Lynda Fernandez has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors to become the new Chief Executive Officer of HGAR,” said HGAR President D’Anzica. “As a current Association CEO, and someone who has served as a former top executive at the nation’s largest local Realtor association for more than 15 years, Lynda represents a new generation of leadership. Lynda is a change-agent who is results-driven, dynamic and multilingual.”</p>
<p>He continued, “As President of HGAR, I am honored to welcome, and looking forward to working with, Lynda as she helps to steer HGAR into the future, build on its successes, and unleash its full potential in order to solidify its reputation as one of the largest and most outstanding Realtor associations in this country.”</p>
<p>D’Anzica noted that throughout her career, Fernandez was involved in a number of significant association merger transactions, including the historic 2010 merger between The Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches and the Realtor Association of Miami-Dade County, which created the Miami Association of Realtors (MIAMI). At the time it was the largest merger in the history of the National Association of Realtors and brought together 23,000 Realtors in South Florida, and which is now the largest local Realtor association in the nation.</p>
<p>Fernandez said, “I am very excited to be joining an impressive organization like HGAR and am looking forward to continuing its great legacy as I work with the exceptional leadership to advance their vision.”</p>
<p>Fernandez began her tenure as CEO of the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors on April 26, 2021. She led GLAR through the COVID-19 pandemic and oversaw its expansion that culminated last month with its merger with the Old Kentucky Home Board of Realtors. The new organization is the largest local Realtor Association in Kentucky, representing more than 5,600 members in 13 counties.</p>
<p>She was responsible for 15 staff professionals and a contract lobbyist, two separate board of directors, including a wholly-owned MLS, and was responsible for a $3-million annual budget. Among her chief accomplishments include launching Kentucky’s first Global Council and launching Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>Fernandez previously held several posts with the Miami Association of Realtors, where she served as MIAMI’s Chief of Communications &amp; Global from Sept. 2018-April 2021. Previously, she was the Senior Vice President of Public Relations and International for MIAMI for almost 14 years.</p>
<p>Prior to her association with the Miami Association of Realtors, Fernandez worked in public relations for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. She holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Journalism and Mass Communications from Florida International University in Miami, FL, and a Master of Accounting Degree from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, FL.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Existing-home sales in the Northeast declined 2.0% from April to an annual rate of 500,000 in May, down 25.4% from May 2022. The median price in the Northeast was $439,000, up 2.5% from one year ago.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales marginally increased in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were mixed among the four major U.S. regions, with the South and West posting improvements and the Northeast and Midwest experiencing home sales pullbacks. All four regions experienced year-over-year sales declines.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast declined 2.0% from April to an annual rate of 500,000 in May, down 25.4% from May 2022. The median price in the Northeast was $439,000, up 2.5% from one year ago.</p>
<p>Total U.S. existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—rose 0.2% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.30 million in May. Year-over-year, sales dropped 20.4% (down from 5.40 million in May 2022).</p>
<p>“Mortgage rates heavily influence the direction of home sales,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Relatively steady rates have led to several consecutive months of consistent home sales.”</p>
<p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of May was 1.08 million units, up 3.8% from April but down 6.1% from one year ago (1.15 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.0-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.9 months in April and 2.6 months in May 2022.</p>
<p>“Available inventory strongly impacts home sales, too,” Yun added. “Newly constructed homes are selling at a pace reminiscent of pre-pandemic times because of abundant inventory in that sector. However, existing-home sales activity is down sizably due to the current supply being roughly half the level of 2019.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in May was $396,100, a decline of 3.1% from May 2022 ($408,600). Prices grew in the Northeast and Midwest but fell in the South and West.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 18 days in May, down from 22 days in April but up from 16 days in May 2022. Seventy-four percent of homes sold in May were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 28% of sales in May, down from 29% in April but up from 27% in May 2022. NAR&#8217;s 2022 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2022—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 26%, the lowest since NAR began tracking the data.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions in May, down from 28% in April and identical to one year ago.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 15% of homes in May, down from 17% in April and 16% the previous year.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in May, virtually unchanged from last month and the prior year.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.69% as of June 15. That&#8217;s down from 6.71% the previous week but up from 5.78% one year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales dipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.85 million in May, down 0.3% from 3.86 million in April and 20.0% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $401,100 in May, down 3.4% from May 2022.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 450,000 units in May, up 4.7% from April, but down 23.7% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $353,000 in May, nearly identical to the prior year ($353,100).</p>
<p>“A temporary capital gains tax reduction on a sale of investment property can lead to a boost in housing inventory, home sales and the economy,” said NAR President Kenny Parcell, a Realtor from Spanish Fork, UT, and broker-owner of Equity Real Estate Utah. “Policymakers need to seriously consider the measure.”</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales faded 2.9% from one month ago to an annual rate of 990,000 in May, decreasing 20.8% from the previous year. The median price in the Midwest was $298,000, up 1.1% from May 2022.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South expanded 1.5% from April to an annual rate of 2.02 million in May, sliding 16.5% from the prior year. The median price in the South was $361,400, down 2.7% from May 2022.</p>
<p>In the West, existing-home sales rose 2.6% from the previous month to an annual rate of 790,000 in May, down 25.5% from one year ago. The median price in the West was $596,500, down 5.7% from May 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>HIGHLAND FALLS—The storm damage from the torrential rains that hit the Hudson Valley on Sunday is considerable. At a press conference on Monday, Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus said the damage in the Highland Falls/West Point area alone is in the “tens of millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul, Neuhaus and other state, county and local officials chronicled the road, bridge and sewer infrastructure damage and power outages in the area from the storm that claimed the life of one Orange County resident. First responders rescued people from flooded homes, and from cars stranded on flooded roadways throughout the region. Neuhaus and Hocul, who both declared a State of Emergency for Orange County, said the state would be looking for financial assistance from the federal government to help pay for and expedite repairs. The governor also declared a state of emergency for Ontario County in the Finger Lakes region of the state.  Putnam County Executive Kevin Byrne declared a state of emergency in Putnam County due to the storm damage there.</p>
<p>Locally, Town of Yorktown Supervisor Tom Diana declared a state of emergency on Monday in response to significant storm damage that included a sinkhole behind Town Hall, compromised culverts, boulders moved into roads, washed out roads and flooding. “As the water recedes, I’m sure we’re going to find more damage. There are roads washed out all over the place, so we advise everyone to use caution when they drive. Do not drive into standing water because you don’t know how deep it might be,” said Supervisor Diana.</p>
<p>Flooding from the storm caused numerous closures of state and local roads, as well as disruption of Metro-North commuter rail service due to damaged rail lines, particularly on the Hudson Line. In addition to Orange County, sections of Rockland, Putnam and Westchester counties also experienced significant storm damage.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul said, “The first step is assessment, assess the damage, assess the monetary value of the damage so we can put in our request for FEMA assistance to help the communities have the resources they need to rebuild we&#8217;ll be putting in all those requests, working with our local partners to make sure we have an accurate assessment of the cost and the damage done.” She later noted that in the past nine months, New York State has seen a storm that caused more snow fall in a 24-hour period in the history of the state and a few weeks ago Canadian wildfires brought some of the most unhealthy air that state has seen in a generation. The Sunday storm is being described as a 1,000-year event that resulted in only the second time ever, the National Weather Service issuing a flash flood emergency in the state. The last time was Hurricane Ida.</p>
<p>Calling weather events such as this as “the new normal, Gov. Hochul added, “Right now, we are in the midst of an extraordinary, extraordinary weather event that has just devastated communities. We must change our behavior as a planet, as a country, as a state, and in our own homes, and we&#8217;re going to continue that conversation in earnest because we have to know that we have to do everything in our power to protect our citizens.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan urged FEMA to stand ready to approve any request from New York State for a major disaster declaration following the severe flash flooding that has rampaged through the Hudson Valley and other communities across Upstate NY over the past 24 hours. The representatives specifically referenced Orange and Ontario Counties as being particularly battered by the heavy downpours that caused severe flooding that destroyed homes, washing away roads and bridges.</p>
<p>“Over the past 24 hours, Orange County and communities across the Hudson Valley and Upstate have been battered by heavy downpours that caused historic levels of flooding, widespread damage, and tragically, at least one death,” said Sen. Schumer. “This loss of life and extensive damage to homes, businesses, and transportation infrastructure is devastating and will likely total tens of millions of dollars in costs suffered taking months and months to repair, according to my early discussion with those on the ground. From Highland Falls and West Point to Cold Spring and Stony Point, this catastrophic flooding has wreaked havoc on the Hudson Valley and areas across Upstate NY, and with more rain expected to fall, FEMA needs to mobilize its Disaster Assessment Teams and stand ready if requested by New York State to swiftly approve any forthcoming requests from the state for assistance to help these communities recover.”</p>
<p>In an update last night, state officials noted that MTA Metro-North Railroad previously announced a partial restoration of train service on the Hudson Line beginning this mornig (July 11). Hudson Line trains will operate between Grand Central Terminal and Peekskill at least once per hour. Metro-North will continue to provide limited bus service for essential travelers between Croton-Harmon and Poughkeepsie, with buses departing Croton-Harmon on a load-and-go basis. Buses will make stops at Croton-Harmon, Beacon and Poughkeepsie. There is no substitute service provided at Manitou, Garrison, Cold Spring and New Hamburg. Bus service on the Upper Harlem Line between Southeast and Wassaic will continue on Tuesday at least through mid-day, making all station stops.</p>
<p>Not including county and local roads impacted by the storm, as of last night, the following state roads remained closed:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The second quarter 2023 regional data showed lower sales and stabilizing prices in reaction to high interest rates that during June at times exceeded 7%. Inventory levels plummeted in the region, giving home buyers less purchase options.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At the end of the second quarter of 2023, member firms of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR) were reporting that buying demand remained high, however, buyer confidence had been shaken by the banking crisis, high interest rates, inflation and a predicted economic downturn or recession. The results of the second quarter clearly show that these headwinds remain a concern for many homebuyers and home sellers here and across the nation.</p>
<p>The second quarter 2023 regional data showed lower sales and stabilizing prices in reaction to high interest rates that during June at times exceeded 7%. Inventory levels plummeted in the region, giving home buyers less purchase options.</p>
<p>Residential sales, which include single-family homes, condominiums, co-operatives and 2-4-family multi-family homes, decreased across the board in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of 2022, with both Westchester and Sullivan counties seeing the largest sales volume declines at 26.8% and 26.9%, respectively. Rockland County had a decrease in residential sales of 19%, Putnam County saw a decrease of 19.5%, Orange County posted a decrease of 19.7% and Bronx County’s home sales were 20.3% lower. One bright spot in the second quarter of this year was the niche co-operative market in Rockland County, which saw a 60% jump in the number of transactions compared to the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>In Westchester County, the single-family home median sale price was down by 4.4% to $846,500, while the second quarter 2023 median sale price of a multi-family house in Westchester jumped 5.2% to $746,850. The condominium, median sale price increased by 5.6% to $475,000 as compared to 12 months earlier. The co-op median sale price in Westchester County decreased by 8.6% to $185,000 in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>In Rockland, Putnam, Sullivan and Orange counties, median sale prices increased for all property classes, with standouts being a 22.2% increase in the multi-family median sale price in Rockland County to $665,750, and a 34.7% increase in Orange County’s multi-family median sale price to $409,000. Bronx County saw a decrease in median sale price across all property classes, with the largest decrease being 22.8% in the co-op market to $192,500.</p>
<p>Single-family home prices seem to be stabilizing. Putnam County posted a 2.6% increase in the second quarter of this year to $492,500; Rockland County saw a 1.1% increase in the single-family home median price to $652,000. Orange County’s single-family median was flat with just a 0.2% increase in the second quarter of 2023 to $415,655. Bronx County’s single-family median declined 2.9% to $602,000, while Sullivan County posted the largest increase at 7.7%, which pushed the median price to $280,000.</p>
<p>Total inventory levels (all property types) in the second quarter of 2023 were down sharply in all HGAR markets as compared to the same period a year ago led by Putnam County’s 65.2% decline; followed by Westchester (-31.4%); Orange County (-29.6%); Bronx County (-26.9%); Rockland County (-26.7%); and Sullivan County (-13.3%).</p>
<p>The Average Days on Market for single-family homes in the HGAR market area increased by double digits with the exception of Sullivan County, which saw a 3.5% decline to 70 days. Putnam County’s Average DOM shot up 54.5% to 70 days, followed by Rockland County’s single-family market which registered a 47.6% hike in Average DOM to 43 days in the second quarter. Orange County single-family homes stood on the market for an average of 61 days in the second quarter, a 27.7% hike from 12 months earlier. Bronx County posted a 21.6% jump in Average DOM to 80 days, while Westchester County listed single-family homes were on the market for sale for 42 days, a 21.3% increase from the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>While the regional economy continues to show strong job growth and low unemployment, national trends provide a mixed-bag looking forward. While a recent jobs report indicated the national economy is beginning to slow down, the Federal Reserve Board, which paused interest rate hikes in June, appears likely to hike rates once again at its meetings later this month.</p>
<p>The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that for the week ended June 30, 2023, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 6.85% from 6.75% the prior week, while the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo loan balances (greater than $726,200) increased to 6.95% from 6.91% the prior week.</p>
<p>MBA Chief Economist Mike Fratantoni said in reaction to the jobs report, “The incoming economic data has been filled with conflicting signals. Manufacturing activity remains quite weak, while consumer spending has held up somewhat better, and new home construction and sales have picked up. Our forecast is for a slowdown in economic activity in the second half of 2023, with a recovery in early 2024. The June employment report reinforces that forecast.” He added that while job and wage growth are trending lower, “both are still well above the pace that would be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s inflation target. We now expect that the FOMC will raise the federal funds target another 25 basis points at its July meeting.”</p>
<p>National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said, “The weaker job market combined with decelerating wage growth and calming consumer price inflation are clear indications for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. The American dream of homeownership has been a challenge for younger adults. High mortgage rates, along with the lack of housing inventory, have been the main hindrance. More effort should be directed toward raising the housing supply by focusing on worker training in home building and lessening barriers to construction so that once interest rates decline, there will not be a resurgence of rapid home price growth.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Amid a significant shortage of housing supply in 2022, 32% of Realtors named a lack of inventory as the most important factor limiting potential clients from making a purchase, according to the National Association of Realtors’ 2023 Member Profile released on July 11. This annual report analyzes members’ business activity and demographics from the prior year. Housing inventory fell to the lowest level recorded since 1999 as home buyers entered the market at a frenzied pace to lock in historically-low interest rates.</p>
<p>“The report’s findings clearly show that the lack of housing inventory is impacting Realtors’ ability to find buyers a home,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “Housing inventory and affordability continue to be the top obstacles that hold back potential clients in the housing market.”</p>
<p><strong>Business Characteristics of Realtors</strong></p>
<p>Nearly two out of three Realtors—64%—hold sales agent licenses, while 20% hold broker licenses and 18% hold broker associate licenses. Seventy percent of members specialize in residential brokerage. Like in 2021, relocation, residential property management and commercial brokerage are members’ most common secondary specialty areas.</p>
<p>Members typically have 11 years of real estate experience, up from eight years in 2021. Those surveyed with two years or less experience declined to 17% in 2022, down from 25% in 2021, while those with 16 years or more experience increased to 42% in 2022, up from 39% in 2021. Like in recent surveys, more than three-quarters of members—76%—are certain they will remain in the real estate industry for at least two more years.</p>
<p><strong>Business Activity of Realtors</strong></p>
<p>The typical NAR member had a higher sales volume ($3.4 million vs. $2.6 million) and the same number of transactions (12) in 2022 compared to 2021.</p>
<p>The typical Realtor earned 27% of their business from previous clients and customers, an increase from 16% last year. The most experienced members—those with 16 or more years of experience—reported a greater share of repeat business from clients or referrals (a median of 43% in 2022 vs. a median of 44% in 2021). Similar to 2021, members with two years of experience or less reported no repeat business in 2022. Overall, Realtors earned a median of 24% of their business from referrals, an increase from 20% in 2021. Referrals were also more common among members with more experience, with a median of 30% for those with 16 or more years of experience (vs. 31% in 2021) compared to 4% for those with two years or less of experience (vs. 0% in 2021).</p>

<p><strong>Income and Expenses of Realtors</strong></p>
<p>The median gross income for Realtors increased to $56,400 in 2022, up from $54,300 in 2021. Realtors with 16 years or more experience had a median gross income of $80,700, down from $85,000 in 2021. Realtors with two years or less experience had a median gross income of $9,600, an increase from $8,800 in 2021. Higher inflation impacted Realtors last year as total expenses increased to $8,210 in 2022 from $6,250 in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Office and Firm Affiliation of Realtors</strong></p>
<p>A majority of Realtors—55%—worked with an independent company and 89% were independent contractors at their firms—both figures nearly identical to 2021. Forty-three percent of members worked at a firm with one office and nearly one-quarter (24%) worked at a firm with two to four offices. The typical Realtor had a median tenure of six years with their current firm, up from a median of five years in 2021. Twenty-six percent of members reported working for a firm that was bought or merged in the past two years, up from 8% in 2021. Like in 2021, errors and omissions insurance was the most common benefit provided by members’ firms in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and Realtors</strong></p>
<p>Daily, the strong majority of Realtors use a smartphone with wireless e-mail and Internet capability (95%) and a laptop or desktop computer (90%). The smartphone features that members use most frequently on a daily basis are e-mail (93%), GPS apps (48%) and social media (46%). Text messaging (94%) is the top method of communication for members with their clients, followed by phone calls (92%) and e-mail (90%)—all the same as last year. Two-thirds of members—66%—have their own website. Seven percent of Realtors use drones themselves as part of their business, and 43% have hired a professional drone operator. Four percent and 1% of members, respectively, use 3D/virtual tour and virtual staging technology daily.</p>
<p>“Despite the changing market conditions that Realtors faced throughout 2022, members rose to the challenge by embracing new technology to help buyers find their homes and sellers to market their properties,” Lautz said.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic Characteristics of Realtors</strong></p>
<p>Eighty-one percent of Realtors were White in 2022, up from 77% in 2021. Hispanics/Latinos accounted for 10% of Realtors, followed by Black/African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders—both at 5%. When compared to more experienced members, new Realtors tended to be more diverse. Among those who had two years or less of experience, 41% were racial minorities in 2022, an increase from 37% one year ago.</p>
<p>Sixty-two percent of all Realtors were female in 2022, down from 66% in 2021. The median age of Realtors was 60, up from 56 from the previous year. Just over half of members—52%—were over 60 years old and 1% were under the age of 30.</p>
<p>Overall, the education level among Realtors exceeded that of the general public. Ninety-one percent of members had some post-secondary education, with 31% completing a bachelor’s degree as their highest level of educational attainment.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of members—66%—reported volunteering in their community. Volunteering was most common among members aged 40 to 49 years.</p>
<p>“Realtors are everyday, working Americans who champion homeownership and property rights for the communities they serve,” said NAR President Kenny Parcell, a Realtor from Spanish Fork, UT, and broker-owner of Equity Real Estate Utah. “Regardless of how you find a property, expert real estate agents help take the stress out of the home buying process and navigate what is for many the most complex and important transaction they’ll ever do.”</p>
<p><strong>Survey Methodology</strong></p>
<p>In March 2023, NAR e-mailed a 98-question survey to a random sample of 146,624 Realtors. Using this method, NAR received 6,902 total responses. The survey had an adjusted response rate of 4.7%. The confidence interval at a 95% level of confidence is +/- 1.18% based on a population of 1.5 million members. The association weighted survey responses to be representative of state-level NAR membership. Information about compensation, earnings, sales volume and number of transactions are characteristics of calendar year 2022, while all other data are representative of member characteristics in early 2023.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The warmth of the summer is creeping in and it’s time to put your toes in the sand and relax; unless you’re a Realtor. For Realtors, it’s the busy season, but you know this already. So, after you have finished showing all those properties, completed your prospecting, followed up on your phone calls, listed and staged your most recent listing, discussed your most recent offers, and helped find the right bank, inspector, contractor, painter, plumber, landscaper, electrician, stager, photographer, and attorney, take a moment for yourself. Relax! And while you lie down on the hammock, possibly with a cocktail or some other refreshing beverage in hand, here is some light reading to keep you updated on recent real estate activities in the New York area and nationally.</p>
<p><strong>New Triennial Requirement Starting in 2025</strong></p>
<p>As a part of its ongoing efforts to address fair housing inequality, NAR recently established a new triennial requirement for all Realtors. All Realtors must now complete two hours of fair housing training every three years as a condition of Realtor membership. Beneficially, NAR has even included one training option that is of no cost to members. The three-year cycle coincides with NAR’s existing Code of Ethics training requirement and begins in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Courses satisfying the new NAR requirement are:</strong></p>
<p>• <em>At Home With Diversity</em>, a course to help real estate professionals work successfully in an increasingly diverse marketplace.</p>
<p>• <em>Bias Override</em>: Overcoming Barriers to Fair Housing, a course to help real estate professionals identify and interrupt stereotypical thinking to avoid fair housing pitfalls.</p>
<p>• Any qualified equivalent courses provided by state or local associations, institutes, societies and councils, and their partnered providers.</p>
<p>• Any qualified equivalent fair housing courses approved by state licensing authorities for an existing state fair housing requirement.</p>
<p>• Any to-be-created non-residential practitioner course focused on bias and anti-discrimination training.</p>
<p>• <em>Fairhaven</em>: NAR’s online fair housing simulation, will also be updated to meet the stated learning objectives and the two-hour time frame requirement so that it can be included in the list of qualifying courses and serve as the no-cost option.</p>
<p><strong>New York City Adds New Protected Classes</strong></p>
<p>Last month, weight and height were added to New York City’s protected classes by Mayor Eric Adams. The new measure means that in New York City you can be sued for discrimination against, and harassment of persons based on these characteristics. In addition to prohibiting such actions, the ordinance may require certain accommodations to allow persons equal access despite their height and/or weight. The creation of this new class was based upon studies that showed that people routinely discriminated against others based upon their appearance.</p>
<p>Under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) currently considers morbid obesity to fall within the definition of protected medical conditions. However, discrimination based on appearance alone would not be protected under the ADA. It should be noted that New York State is considering legislation similar to the New York City measure, as are several additional states, including New Jersey and Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>Property Condition Disclosure Statement Update</strong></p>
<p>Last month I provided a notice that the Property Condition Disclosure Statement had recently been updated and now included a section regarding the presence and/or treatment of mold. This new form should replace any older versions that any New York real estate office has on file.</p>
<p>Since that notice, I’ve had several calls regarding the requirement that this form MUST be filled out. So, to clarify, the form is required to be used; however, the homeowner, after consultation with their attorney, may choose not to pay $500 at the time of the closing in lieu of filling out the form. This is the same as it was in the past. What is important to remember is that the real estate licensee should not be advising the homeowner as to whether or not they should fill out the form. Leave that to the attorney.</p>
<p><strong>No Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>Real estate licensees may not make any unsolicited phone calls to a member of the public during a State of Emergency. General Business Law §399-z(5)(a) states: <em>“It shall be unlawful for any telemarketer doing business in this state to knowingly make an unsolicited telemarketing sales call to any person in a county, city, town or village under a declared state of emergency or disaster emergency as described in sections twenty-four or twenty-eight of the executive law.”</em></p>
<p>NYSAR has interpreted this to include text messaging as well. Whether the State of Emergency is related to real estate activities is irrelevant; there just has to be a State of Emergency. Currently, there are three active State of Emergency orders in effect.</p>
<p>During a State of Emergency, you may not call a person’s home or cell phone to establish a new business relationship with them or solicit them to list their home for sale. You can call a FSBO if you have an identifiable purchaser interested in the property. However, you are prohibited from calling the FSBO to solicit the listing. It should be noted that you may still make business-to-business calls so long as you are calling the number provided as the business number.</p>
<p>All other types of marketing such as mailers, billboards, social media, Internet etc., are permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Today’s light read isn’t earth-shattering. However, it’s important to remain vigilant and aware of what is happening in your business arena, even if it’s done with your toes in the sand, on a boat, sitting in the backyard, or like me, under a tree on a blanket. Happy summer everyone!</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In June, both the New York State Assembly and Senate approved passage of the Limited Liability Company Transparency Act [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3JMhqNu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3JMhqNu</a>] (the “LLC Transparency Act” or “New York’s Act”). The bill is awaiting signature by Gov. Kathy Hochul and would go into effect 365 days after it is signed. The legislature’s stated purpose of the bill is “to end the practice of anonymous ownership of limited liability companies in New York by defining beneficial ownership, requiring the disclosure of the identities of beneficial owners upon company formation or registration, and publishing beneficial owners of limited liability companies in New York&#8217;s publicly searchable business entity database.” One of the key features of a limited liability company, which is to protect the identity of owners from being disclosed publicly, has been simply removed.</p>
<p>Potential real estate investors, who primarily set up limited liability companies when purchasing and investing in real estate, will undoubtedly think twice before they do so in New York. This will certainly have a chilling effect on future real estate investment in New York State. The passage of the LLC Transparency Act comes only a few years after the passage of LLC disclosure legislation in 2019, which required the disclosure of members’ names and the names of authorized persons and managers of the owner LLC in connection with the sale of 1-to-4 family residential real property. New York’s Act also follows closely the enactment, on the federal level, of the Corporate Transparency Act [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3JMXs59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3JMXs59</a>] which is set to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2024. The new LLC Transparency Act goes well beyond the scope of the 2019 Legislation and the CTA, and exposes private information in a public database for all to see.</p>
<p><strong>The 2019 Law Requiring Disclosure on 1-to-4 Family Transactions</strong></p>
<p>In September 2019, New York State and New York City passed legislation (collectively, the “2019 legislation”) which requires LLCs selling 1-to-4 family residential real property to file, along with the NYC or NYS transfer tax return, “a document which identifies the names and business addresses of all members, managers, and any other authorized persons, if any, of such limited liability company and the names and business addresses or, if none, the business addresses of all shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers and partners of any limited liability company or other business entity that are to be the members, managers or authorized persons, if any, of such limited liability company.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3PPwhdy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3PPwhdy</a> (Section 1409 of the NYS Tax Law) and <a href="https://bit.ly/3XMdVMH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3XMdVMH</a> (Section 11-2105 of the NYC Transfer Tax Law)].</p>
<p>The disclosure required under the 2019 legislation includes the indefinite and continuous disclosure of every individual (i.e., natural person) member of the principal LLC owning the real property and any authorized persons or managers of that principal LLC. If the principal LLC is owned by one or more underlying entities or LLCs, then the names of all members, shareholders, and authorized persons or managers of those entities must be disclosed (regardless of the number of underlying layers or entities that own an interest or manage the principal LLC), along with each of their business addresses.</p>
<p>The 2019 legislation was primarily enacted so that municipalities and agencies could be provided with the names of members or authorized persons so that these individuals may be held accountable for fines and violations (e.g., Environmental Control Board violations, etc.). Since the individuals’ information accompanies the NYS or NYC transfer tax return and is filed with the appropriate tax departments, and is not recorded in the County Clerk’s office with the deed to the property, the information is not made publicly available and is only disclosed for a limited purpose to address a specific problem relating to violations and the imposition of fines. This is a major difference between the 2019 legislation and the new LLC Transparency Act.</p>
<p><strong>Justifications Behind the CTA and the LLC Transparency Act</strong></p>
<p>Both the LLC Transparency Act and the CTA were principally enacted for purposes of curbing illicit activities. The Final Rule [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3pFufCn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3pFufCn</a>] issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network explains that “illicit actors frequently use corporate structures such as shell and front companies to obfuscate their identities and launder their ill-gotten gains through the U.S. financial system.” FinCEN further points out that these “shell” or “front” companies often “shield beneficial owners&#8217; identities and allow criminals to illegally access and transact in the U.S. economy, while creating an uneven playing field for small U.S. businesses engaged in legitimate activity.” The CTA requires the disclosure of owners’ information so that the appropriate governmental agencies can have access to the personal information of individuals who may want to engage in criminal activity.</p>
<p>Similarly, the justifications cited by legislators in passing the LLC Transparency Act include the following: “Anonymous shell companies are used to bypass sanctions, avoid taxes, fund terrorist organizations and organized crime and launder money. Anonymous LLCs leasing real property are correlated with more numerous code violations, higher rents, and more evictions compared to non-corporate owners. Drug and human traffickers use anonymous shell companies like LLCs to launder the proceeds of their criminal activities and evade detection. Deed theft, campaign finance violations, and bid rigging can be facilitated by anonymous LLCs. Anonymous LLCs hamper routine code enforcement, burdening local governments.” While many of the aforementioned reasons offered above by the New York State Legislature are important, there are some that may not be supported by evidence.</p>
<p>Both the CTA and LLC Transparency Act focus on fighting and curbing illegal activity. In fact, New York’s Act is patterned after the CTA, and also cites and specifically includes certain provisions and definitions from the CTA. Additionally, New York’s Act adopts the same standards as contained in the CTA with regard to the information disclosure requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences Between the CTA &amp; the LLC Transparency Act</strong></p>
<p>While the justifications behind the federal and state legislation are similar, there are key differences between CTA and the LLC Transparency Act. New York’s Act applies only to limited liability companies. However, similar to the 2019 legislation, if there are additional layers of entities that own the main entity, the disclosure of the individuals who own those underlying entities would be required to be disclosed. Additionally, New York’s Act applies to LLCs formed in New York and foreign (i.e., out-of-state) LLCs that are registered or required to register to conduct business in New York. The CTA, on the other hand, applies to all types of entities, including corporations.</p>
<p><strong>Penalties and Fines Under the CTA and New York’s Act </strong></p>
<p>Another difference between the two laws relates to the penalties for non-compliance. Under the LLC Transparency Act, if an LLC fails to file a beneficial ownership disclosure “for a period exceeding two years shall be shown to be delinquent on the records of the Department of State after a notice of delinquency has been mailed to the last known address of such reporting company, and such company has failed to file such information within 60 days of the mailing of such notice.” If the company fails to file the information, the Department of State will assess a civil penalty of $250.00 against the company. While it is not clear from the legislation, this delinquency notation may come up in a title search and may be required to be remedied before a seller will be permitted to close on a real estate transaction.</p>
<p>The CTA, in contrast, provides for much more severe penalties for non-compliance. If a company or owner willfully or intentionally violates the CTA’s reporting requirements, the company could be subject to civil penalties of up to $500 per day for continuing violations. Owners could also face criminal penalties of up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to two years.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Concerns: New York’s LLC Transparency Act Goes Too Far</strong></p>
<p>Another critical difference between the LLC Transparency Act and the CTA is the disclosure of personal information to the public. Under the CTA, FinCEN is required to maintain disclosed information of beneficial owners in a confidential, secure and non-public database. The CTA also provides significant protections against unauthorized disclosure. An individual disclosing such information could face a criminal penalty of up to $250,000 or five years in prison. It is clear that the CTA was carefully tailored and limited to achieve a specific goal.</p>
<p>The LLC Transparency Act, in stark contrast, creates a publicly available database on the Secretary of State’s website which will contain, among other things, the name of the LLC, the business address of the LLC and the full name of each beneficial owner of the LLC. New York’s Act goes too far in disclosing this information in a public database for all to view and access. Using the language cited in New York’s Act itself, disclosure of this information to the public serves “no public interest.” If there are illicit or criminal activities, it is sufficient that the governmental agencies have this information and utilize it only when needed for a legitimate purpose in order to curtail or stop such activities, and making private information available to the public is not necessary to achieve those objectives.</p>
<p>The LLC Transparency Act does provide that beneficial owners may apply for a waiver to withhold their personal information. The bill requires that the Department of State “establish, though regulations, procedures to allow beneficial owners…who site significant privacy interests to apply for a waiver to withhold the name and/or address of a beneficial owner.” However, the burden of proof would be on the beneficial owner to “demonstrate that a significant privacy interest exists,”, which standard will be difficult to meet as is evident from the language of New York’s Act.</p>
<p><strong>Be Ready for Compliance, It’s Right Around the Corner</strong></p>
<p>The CTA goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2024 and New York’s LLC Transparency Act will go into effect 365 days after the bill is signed by the governor. While there is still some time, it is important that business owners review their entities and adequately prepare for compliance. It is important to review the structure of existing companies and prepare in advance to file the necessary disclosures. While many smaller entities are owned by one or two members, there are many that are owned through various layers of other entities, and include dozens and hundreds of members, and/or are operated or managed by numerous individuals. It is important to contact accounting and legal professionals in order to determine what will need to be filed and to discuss potential alternative entities. Again, it is important to note that the CTA covers all entities and New York’s Act only applies to LLCs, and since real estate investment in New York is primarily done through LLCs, this will certainly affect investment going forward.</p>

NYS Assembly Bill 6680 was introduced by Assemblymember Amy Paulin (D-88th District of Scarsdale), voted on and passed with unanimous support!]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>The dust has settled and we find ourselves standing on the brink of success?</p>
<p>As you know, the 2023 legislative session was exciting, but unproductive. Passing about half the number of bills as they did the year before, the 2023 session will be remembered for having a budget that was a month late, a housing crisis demurred, and the momentary defeat of “Good Cause” eviction. Yet, the 2023 legislative session was not without a very important victory.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that there has been significant movement on the technical amendments that prohibit telemarketing activities during a state of emergency. NYS Assembly Bill 6680 was introduced by Assemblymember Amy Paulin (D-88th District, Scarsdale), voted on and passed with unanimous support!</p>
<p>Movement on this issue and the success of this bill comes from our great team at the New York State Association of Realtors and the leadership of Government Affairs Directors Mike Kelly and Legislative and Political Affairs Director Jared Burns. However, possibly more important is that we can draw a direct line to our hoped-for success on the telemarketing ban issue to HGAR’s Lobby Day and the resultant movement of this bill based on the association’s advocacy</p>
<p>Assemblymember Paulin, the bill’s sponsor, was one of the elected officials who attended our Lobby Day. The importance of this issue was conveyed to Assemblywoman Paulin and her Assembly colleagues that attended the HGAR session. Within a month of our May 2nd Lobby Day, the Assemblywoman had A.6680 voted on and passed on the Assembly floor by June 6th. And not just passed but passed with unanimous support. In such a decisive time, this is truly a feat to be recognized. The success of Lobby Day had real and substantial consequences for our issues. Thank you.</p>
<p>Alas, our efforts have won us the battle but not the war. The New York State Senate has proven to be more of a stickler when it comes to the commonsense solution of A.6680. The companion bill S.412, sponsored by State Senator Thomas (D-6th District-Long Island, has not made any significant movement this legislative session. That being said, the Assembly passing this bill with such overwhelming support put a lot of pressure on the Senate.</p>
<p>So, the battle lines are set. We have the Assembly and come January, we will consolidate our efforts and focus on the Senate. In a legislative session laced with inaction and infighting, it is truly amazing that we were able to convey our needs on this issue so effectively. I have complete faith that HGAR and NYSAR will be able to move the needle forward in 2024. There will be more to come, but until then, please enjoy the summer and rest up, because we have a lot of work to do soon.</p>
<p>For anyone looking for more information on the Telemarketing Activities bill, details about the bill text and movement, Google NYS Assembly A.6680.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Tesla is relocating operations from Bethlehem, PA to Newburgh and plans to open its East Coast Parts Distribution Center during the third quarter of this year. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—The Orange County Partnership reported earlier today that Tesla, the renowned electric car manufacturer, has selected Orange County as the home for its new regional distribution facility for vehicle parts in the Town of Newburgh.</p>
<p>Orange County Partnership officials stated that Tesla will occupy 927,000 square feet of speculative space built by Matrix Development Group at 1396 Route 300 in the Town of Newburgh.</p>
<p>Matrix secured approvals for the business park located on Route 300 in 2022 and has since constructed two buildings of 215,000 square feet and 927,000 square feet. The property, located directly across from the Newburgh Mall and adjacent to the I-84/I-87 interchange, is considered a strategic location for the logistics and warehouse/distribution sector.</p>
<p>Tesla plans to open its East Coast Parts Distribution Center at the site by the end of 2023. Tesla plans to initially employ 150 workers at the Newburgh facility by the end of this year and eventually ramp up to a 300-member workforce there, according to an Orange County Partnership official.</p>
<p>No financial details or terms of the transaction were disclosed.</p>
<p>Based in Monroe Township, NJ, Matrix is a development firm with a rich portfolio of projects in Orange County including: AmerisourceBergen, wineshipping.com and other projects throughout the tri-state area.</p>
<p>“Matrix has a long history of undertaking quality projects in Orange County. The Tesla signing is yet another example of the value of speculative development, and exactly why we supported the approval of this robust business park. Our market is strong—we will continue to support site development in the effort to attract more quality companies to Orange County. We welcome Tesla to Orange County with open arms” said Maureen Halahan, President, and CEO of the Orange County Partnership.</p>
<p>“Tesla is changing the automotive industry in America and abroad. Having a relationship with Tesla in Orange County can raise income levels for our area and create good jobs. It will also increase competition for our workforce and is another major name in the American economy choosing to come to Orange County,” said Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[In a year-over-year comparison, the closed median sale price held steady, decreasing less than 1.00% from the $615,000 reported in June 2022.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS reported a regional closed median sale price of $612,000 in June, a 3.40% increase as compared to the $592,000 reported in May 2023. In a year-over-year comparison, the closed median sale price held steady, decreasing less than 1.00% from the $615,000 reported in June 2022.</p>
<p>The OneKey MLS report released on July 18th covered residential real estate transactions in nine counties from Montauk to Manhattan, north through the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains.</p>
<p>Between May 2023 and June 2023, closed regional sales transactions, including residential, condo, and co-op sales, increased to 4,747 from 4,063, representing a month-over-month increase of 16.80%. Across the region, pending sales transactions decreased slightly by 1.30% in a month-over-month comparison, reportedly 5,355 in June 2023 as compared to the 5,424 in May 2023.</p>
<p>Six of nine counties reported an increased closed median sale price in a month-over-month comparison, while three counties reported a decreased median sale price. Westchester (+14.10%), Orange (+9.50%), Sullivan (+6.30 %), Nassau (+4.50%), Suffolk (+3.60%), and Rockland (+0.40%) counties reported month-over-month increases in closed median sale price. Queens (-1.50%), Putnam (-3.90%) and Bronx (-7.20%) counties reported month-over-month decreases in their respective June closed median sale price as compared to May 2023.</p>
<p>Pointing to the slowing rate of inflation, Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS said, “This may be an early sign that we will begin to see mortgage rates decrease in the next several months. Lower interest rates could be a catalyst that boosts market activity, prompting more sellers to list their homes, especially as price increases have softened.”</p>
<p>OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from nine counties making up the regional MLS coverage area, and reports individually on each county represented. The infographic demonstrates month-over-month closed median home price comparisons for the region.</p>
<p>Made possible by the merger of MLSLI and Hudson Gateway MLS, OneKey MLS, is one of the nation&#8217;s leading Multiple Listing Services, serving more than 48,000 Realtor subscribers and 4,500 participating offices throughout Long Island, Manhattan, and the Hudson Valley.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NYACK—In the first of a series of programs that will focus on the key market areas serviced by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, the association staged a highly-informative and well-attended “Rockland County Day” program on July 17 at the Nyack Seaport here.</p>
<p>The event brought together Realtors, local politicians, economic development officials and other local groups for an afternoon of discussion, legislative and legal insights and updates on some of the happenings in and around Rockland County.</p>
<p>One major topic of discussion was the damage caused by the torrential rains and flash flooding over the past few weeks. Rockland County Executive Ed Day, part of a Legislative panel that included State Sen. Bill Weber (R-C-38th District) and State Assemblyman Kenneth Zebrowski (D-96th District), updated the attendees on the latest road closures and openings and noted that Gov. Kathy Hochul had requested a Major Disaster Declaration from President Biden, which if granted, would make a host of counties in the state, including Rockland County, eligible for FEMA assistance.</p>
<p>The panel, moderated by HGAR Director of Government Affairs Alex Roithmayr, also delved into the controversial housing crisis issue and Gov. Hochul’s “New York Housing Compact” plan that failed to garner sufficient support from the New York State Legislature. In fact, the proposal, which sought to build 800,000 new homes statewide, was criticized by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle for circumventing local home rule.</p>
<p>While noting the need for more affordable housing, the panelists bristled at the governor’s plan that included targeted development goals for communities and penalties for non-compliance. The compact also would have allowed developers to seek approval from a panel after being denied by local authorities.</p>
<p>Rockland County Executive Day pulled no punches in his opposition to the compact. He said any housing plan should involve incentives for development and should not circumvent local control.</p>

Hochul and lawmakers in Albany in 2024.<br /> PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</p></div>
<p>“Don’t tell us how to do it,” Day said. “With all due respect to the governor, they (state lawmakers) don’t know what they are doing. This is what happened with bail reform and a number of other issues here in the state.” The County Executive, who also opposed a component of the compact that promoted Accessory Dwelling Units, noted that Rockland County will be hosting a Housing Forum in the near future to address some of the key issues affecting the residential market in Rockland County.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Zebrowski said that he opposed the governor’s housing plan due in part to its promotion of ADUs. He said, “I don’t think that you can have a one-size fits all approach and I don’t think you can take away the authority from our local governments in order to correctly and appropriately with public input develop projects with housing,” he said.</p>
<p>The Assemblyman said he would support “a much more robust process where we attempt to identify and incentivize projects around the state.” He said the plan would need to adapt to the local needs of municipalities throughout the state.</p>
<p>State Sen. Weber added that most state lawmakers were against the governor’s compact plan because they believe local jurisdictions should control development decisions, not the state.</p>
<p>He stressed that a long-standing problem in Rockland County is the need for affordable housing for both seniors and young, first-time homebuyers. Sen. Weber said that the state increasing funding for local infrastructure projects could subsequently incentivize needed housing development in those areas.</p>
<p>Later, Michael Oates, President and CEO of the Hudson Valley Economic Development Corp., discussed a host of projects and trends impacting business development in Rockland County and the rest of the Hudson Valley. In his presentation, Oates noted that the housing crisis issue is not going away anytime soon and will likely be a key focus of Gov. Hochul and lawmakers in Albany in 2024.</p>
<p>“The need for housing is incredibly important and a critical need,” Oates said. “We are going to continue to see housing remain one of the most important issues facing the state and we (HVEDC) believe that in conversations with the governor’s office and with the governor herself a new approach will be coming in next year’s budget cycle that will take into account more of what local municipalities want to see happen.”</p>
<p>Among the other speakers at the event included: Tony D&#8217;Anzica, HGAR President; Brian Levine, HGAR General Counsel, Professional Standards Administrator; Sue Ferreri, Executive Director, Rockland Farm Alliance; Sonia Cairo, Executive Director, Keep Rockland Beautiful; and Andrew Farrell, Department Manager, EV Operations, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc.</p>
<p>HGAR President D’Anzica noted that he launched the County Day program initiative as a way to celebrate and focus on the markets HGAR serves. The respective events also offer an opportunity to engage with key stakeholders and learn about the latest developments in the respective counties, while gathering information that HGAR member clients can use.</p>
<p>The sponsors of the Rockland County Day program were: Hudson United Mortgage, Title and Insurance (Premier Sponsor) and sponsors: York Analytical Laboratories Inc., Howard Hanna Rand Realty, Rand Commercial and Tilcon.</p>
<p>HGAR has scheduled “Westchester County Day” on Monday, July 24 at the HGAR offices in White Plains from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. The association has also tentatively scheduled “Bronx Day for Sept. 13; Orange County Day for Oct. 11 and Putnam County Day for Oct. 24.

    <description><![CDATA[ Sales prices continue to rise in the Hudson Valley/Bronx region, although at more moderate levels than in the past. Area Brokers blame current market conditions on low inventory, but add that despite headwinds of high interest rates, inflation, and the continued threat of a recession, buyer demand ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Sales volume in the market area of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors fell sharply in the second quarter of this year with all counties posting significant sales declines ranging from as low as 19% to a high of nearly 27%. Sales prices continue to rise in the Hudson Valley/Bronx region, although at more moderate levels than in the past. Area Brokers blame current market conditions on low inventory, but add that despite headwinds of high interest rates, inflation, and the continued threat of a recession, buyer demand remains strong.</p>
<p>The largest decline in overall residential sales activity in the second quarter was in Sullivan County at 26.9%, followed closely by Westchester County at 26.8% and Bronx County at 20.3%. Rounding out the region, Orange County suffered a 19.7% decline in sales as compared to the second quarter of 2022, Putnam County’s sales fell 19.5%, while activity in Rockland County slipped by 19.0%.</p>
<p>Brokers interviewed by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> pointed to the persistent problem of not enough for-sale inventory throughout the region as the chief culprit for the current sales downturn. The recently released <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2023-2nd-Quarter-Market-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Second Quarter Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx counties</a> noted that all markets suffered a steep decline in inventory. Total inventory levels (all property types) in the second quarter of 2023 were down sharply in all HGAR markets as compared to the same period a year ago led by Putnam County’s 65.2% decline; followed by Westchester County (-31.4%); Orange County (-29.6%); Bronx County (-26.9%); Rockland County (-26.7%); and Sullivan County (-13.3%).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-45189" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/HGAR-Market-Area-Overall-Home-Sales.png" alt="" width="500" height="282" />The second quarter report, based on data compiled by OneKey MLS, stated that single-family home prices in the area appear to be stabilizing. The single-family home median sale price in Westchester County was down by 4.4% to $846,500. Single-family home prices seem to be stabilizing. Putnam County posted a 2.6% increase in the second quarter of this year to $492,500; Rockland County saw a 1.1% increase in the single-family home median price to $652,000. Orange County’s single-family median was flat with just a 0.2% increase in the second quarter of 2023 to $415,655. Bronx County’s single-family median declined 2.9% to $602,000, while Sullivan County posted the largest single-family home sale price increase at 7.7%, which pushed the median price to $280,000.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/news/2023-second-quarter-real-estate-sales-report-westchester-putnam-rockland-orange-sullivan-and-bronx-counties-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the full 2023 Second Quarter Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx counties, including information on the condominium, cooperative and multifamily markets</a>.</p>
<p>2023 HGAR President Tony D’Anzica said, “It&#8217;s difficult to put a positive spin on the most recent market statistics. June statistics reflect a marked reduction in the number of closed sales, demonstrating that the market remains extremely tight with very low inventory. While median sales prices showed some modest increases, price gains are a result of very low inventory and not a reflection of a housing market recovery.”</p>
<p>D&#8217;Anzica, the Broker-Owner of Dynamax Realty NYC Inc., noted that while the average 30-year fixed mortgage rates recently fell marginally, they were still significantly higher than they were a year ago.</p>
<p>“Even with inflation tapering, the Federal Reserve is anticipating two more rate hikes this year, which would push mortgage rates higher, further reducing affordability. Additionally, the average wages required to purchase a home has skyrocketed. Nothing in the current market suggests improved affordability and lack of affordability means that the housing market will remain sluggish.”</p>
<p>Lou Budetti, Principal Broker at ERA Insite Realty of White Plains, pointed squarely at the low levels of inventory as the major factor causing lower sales.</p>
<p>In trying to describe current market conditions, Budetti recalled the campaign slogan of the early 1990s: “It’s the economy stupid,” and gave it his own spin. “The bottom line in today’s real estate market is ‘It’s the inventory stupid.’”</p>
<p>He added that despite the “incredible lack of inventory” and other economic headwinds, buyer demand is still strong. Budetti related that buyer competition is intense in all price ranges. “It’s multiple offers, highest and best, even in the $1-million-plus price range,” he said.</p>
<p>The combination of low inventory and multiple offers “is really discouraging for buyers and really discouraging for agents,” Budetti related.</p>
<p>Past HGAR President Anthony Domathoti, AHWD, CRS, C2EX, SRS, said the HGAR second quarter report “paints a positive picture of the local real estate market. Sellers continue to take advantage of the current conditions to maximize their profits, while buyers should be prepared for a competitive environment.”</p>
<p>Domathoti, the Broker-Owner of EXIT Realty Premium of the Bronx, added that the continued increase in sale prices is troubling to some buyers. “Affordability remains a concern for many prospective buyers. While the market is generally favorable for sellers, affordability issues and higher interest rates continue to limit access to housing for some buyers. Buying or selling has been a challenge to both parties,” he said.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, Managing Partner and Chief Creative Officer of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, said the market right now is “really strange… because when sales go down like this, they usually drag prices down with them, but prices are still reaching historic highs in most of the markets and homes are still selling quickly and for close to the asking price.”</p>
<p>He agreed with his colleagues that rising interest rates have not had a dramatic impact on buyer demand. “Instead, higher rates have completely restricted supply, because sellers with ridiculously low interest rates on their current mortgage basically have ‘golden handcuffs’ that are preventing them from putting their homes on the market. Even with prices at all-time highs, they don’t want to lose their rates,” Rand said.</p>
<p>Residential brokerage firm Houlihan Lawrence, in its second quarter market report for Westchester Putnam and Dutchess counties, said that a significant majority of homeowners are paying below the current average mortgage interest rate of 6.7%, which is the highest in two decades. This phenomenon has thwarted the trade up, trade down activity in all area markets and further exacerbated the already low levels of properties for sale, the brokerage firm stated. The limited inventory of homes, including luxury properties, has intensified competition among buyers and led to upward pressure on prices in most areas.</p>
<p>“This environment has resulted in a beneficial situation for homeowners who decide to sell, and with mortgage rates currently stabilizing, they are becoming more inclined to make a move. At all price points, sellers are often able to realize top dollar for their properties, when properly priced, and achieve significant returns on their real estate investments,” said Liz Nunan, President and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>The luxury real estate market in the region was not immune from the impacts of high interest rates and low inventory. Anthony P. Cutugno, Senior Vice President, Private Brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence, said in the firm’s second quarter luxury market report that the “golden handcuff effect is keeping would-be sellers off the market. Despite limited supply and higher interest rates, the data indicates a resilient luxury market with healthy buyer demand,” he said.</p>
<p>Cutugno noted that the buyers’ sense of urgency has noticeably changed of late. “During the height of COVID-19, buyer urgency was at an all-time high. The purchase of a new home in a lower density area or on a larger parcel was a visceral reaction to COVID and a means to keep one’s family safe,” he said. “As the pandemic moved into the past tense, buyer motivation shifted. Discipline replaced urgency, even as inventory remains low. In fact, low supply gives buyers a reason to wait until the right house becomes available, be it in a month or in a year. This mindset, while practical, squelches urgency and a willingness to compromise,” Cutugno added.</p>
<p>Cutugno concluded his comments with a positive outlook going forward, “The first half of 2023 brought no surprises. The pace of sales is now reflective of a market that is stable. Interest rates are expected to fall in 2023. This should help to correct supply issues that have upset our markets thus far in 2023.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>FORT LEE, NJ—New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, flanked by federal, state and local leaders, announced on Friday that the state had filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to block what it describes as the “ill-conceived: congestion pricing plan advanced by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York City and New York State agencies.</p>
<p>In the suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the State of New Jersey argues that the USDOT and the FHWA violated the National Environmental Protection Act, which requires a full environmental impact review for projects of this projected impact and scope, as well as the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>Since New York and the MTA first revealed their proposed congestion pricing scheme, Gov. Murphy has been a vocal opponent of the congestion pricing plan. In June, the Murphy Administration announced that it had retained Randy Mastro and Craig Carpenito of King &amp; Spalding to explore all of its legal options.</p>
<p>As part of the Murphy Administration’s comprehensive efforts to congestion pricings impact on New Jerseyans, Gov. Murphy also signed S3128/A4694, which will help ensure New Jersey taxpayer dollars stay in our state and go toward programs and services that benefit New Jerseyans. The bill will bring the state’s tax code in line with New York’s and allows New Jersey to tax remote employees who live out of state but work at New Jersey companies—if that state has a similar tax rule.</p>
<p>Additionally, the legislation provides tax credits for New Jersey residents who dispute aggressive tax policies imposed on them by other states. If New Jerseyans take this issue up with another state’s tax authority and receive a tax refund for work they did in New Jersey, the State of New Jersey will provide a tax credit. Furthermore, the bill creates a $35-million grant program to encourage companies that primarily operate outside the state to properly assign their employees that live in New Jersey and to open offices here.</p>
<p>“After refusing to conduct a full environmental review of the MTA’s poorly designed tolling program, the FHWA has unlawfully fast-tracked the agency’s attempt to line its own coffers at the expense of New Jersey families,” said Gov. Murphy. “The costs of standing idly by while the MTA uses New Jersey residents to help balance its budget sheets are more than economic. At the MTA’s own admission, its tolling program would divert traffic and shift pollution to many vulnerable New Jersey communities, impacting air quality while offering nothing to mitigate such considerable harm. Today we stand as a unified front against this reckless scheme and reaffirm our commitment to combat the unjust taxation of our hardworking residents by other states.”</p>
<p>“As the senior senator of New Jersey, I have made it abundantly clear that it’s unacceptable for New York to try balancing its budget on the backs of New Jersey commuters. Their proposed congestion tax scheme is nothing more than a shakedown and must be defeated,” said Senator Bob Menendez. “Today, I am proud to stand with Governor Murphy, as well as other federal, state, and local leaders, as his administration takes legal actions to protect New Jerseyans who travel into New York every day for work.”</p>
<p>At deadline, there are multiple reports that Staten Island Borough President Vito J. Fossella will announce a lawsuit by the borough against the congestion pricing plan on Monday, July 24.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—On Friday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that President Biden approved her request for a Major Disaster Declaration to provide federal assistance to communities impacted by flooding from heavy rainstorms across much of Upstate New York. The declaration releases critical federal assistance to support recovery and reconstruction efforts in Clinton, Dutchess, Essex, Hamilton, Ontario, Orange, Putnam and Rockland counties.</p>
<p>Those counties now have access to financial support for debris removal, emergency protective measures and repairs to public buildings and infrastructure. New York has also engaged with the U.S. Small Business Administration to pursue low-interest recovery loans for impacted businesses. Further assistance to individuals and additional counties across the state still remains under federal review.</p>
<p>“After devastating floods caused extreme damage across Upstate New York this month, I&#8217;m thankful President Biden has approved my request for a Major Disaster Declaration,” Gov. Hochul said. “My administration will work directly with FEMA in the coming weeks to ensure our local government partners receive the critical funding they need to begin the recovery and rebuilding process.”</p>
<p>A Major Disaster Declaration secures financial assistance from the federal government, primarily through FEMA&#8217;s Public Assistance Program, to provide funding to local governments, tribes and eligible non-profits for debris removal, protective measures, and repairs to buildings and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, water and wastewater treatment facilities, critical infrastructure sites, schools, parks and other facilities.</p>
<p>Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, “This declaration unlocks federal funding critical to the recovery of the communities devastated by this month&#8217;s catastrophic flooding. Thanks to the leadership of Governor Hochul and the support of President Biden and our federal partners, these communities can now begin to plan their long-term recovery and New York will remain at their side to help however we can.”</p>
<p>From July 9 &#8211; July 10, more than eight inches of rain was reported in parts of the Mid-Hudson Region and more than five inches of rain in Ontario County, in the Finger Lakes Region. From July 10 &#8211; July 11, parts of the North Country saw several inches of rain in a short period of time, which caused devastating flooding, closing roadways and damaging infrastructure across impacted regions.</p>
<p>Dutchess County Executive William F.X. O&#8217;Neil said, &#8220;We greatly appreciate the assistance from the state and federal government. This declaration will allow local municipalities impacted by devastating flooding to repair and restore critical infrastructure. We are grateful for the diligent efforts of our municipal leaders and state representatives who reacted quickly and efficiently to get the necessary documentation and triage immediate needs, notably Pawling Town supervisor James Schmitt. We will continue to work with state officials and FEMA reps to secure assistance for individuals and businesses as well as work with NYS DHSES and FEMA&#8217;s mitigation team so we not only repair damaged areas, but we also can take action to prevent similar issues in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus said, &#8220;I am happy to hear that the major disaster declaration has been made for Orange County communities impacted by flooding earlier this month. This is another important step in the recovery process and this additional funding will assist us as we recover. I will continue to work with Governor Hochul and advocate for Federal assistance as we rebuild after the storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Putnam County Executive Kevin Byrne said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank President Biden for approving the federal Major Disaster Declaration that will enable FEMA to offer critical financial disaster relief funding to various municipal governments suffering from storm damage. I&#8217;d also like to thank Governor Hochul, her staff and team at the Division of Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Services for working jointly with our team at the Bureau of Emergency Services during the storms and recovery efforts. Every representative from Putnam&#8217;s state and federal delegation took time to reach out and offer support in the aftermath of the storms, and we thank them all, but we also recognize we still have a long way to go before all repairs and mitigation efforts are completed. Many homeowners are still hurting from storm damage. We will continue to work with our partners at the state and federal government to give them what they need to bolster their efforts to bring back additional relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rockland County Executive Ed Day said, &#8220;We acknowledge Governor Kathy Hochul and federal officials for moving this forward. We are satisfied to see help is coming to municipalities. Small businesses can also seek relief through low interest loans through the SBA. We are hopeful there will be more accommodation made for residents.&#8221;</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The primary development objective for the redevelopment of the Downstate Correctional Facility is to maximize benefits to the surrounding community and region while prioritizing housing.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Gov. Kathy Hochul announced recently that Empire State Development, in partnership with the Office of General Services and Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, has issued a Request for Proposals for the former Downstate Correctional Facility located in Fishkill, Dutchess County.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposals advances recommendations made by the Prison Redevelopment Commission and builds on first-in-the-nation strategic efforts to reimagine former prison sites from an economic development focus as prison populations shrink and prisons close. The Request for Proposals is also a part of the governor&#8217;s ongoing effort to identify state-owned sites for potential residential uses to increase the state&#8217;s housing supply in light of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“The formation of the Prison Redevelopment Commission, announced nearly one year ago, was the first comprehensive analysis in the United States for the reuse and redevelopment of New York&#8217;s closed facilities,” Gov. Hochul said. “The commission compiled thoughtful, realistic information and recommendations that considered input from both experts and community stakeholders, and we are hitting the ground running and taking major steps to move these recommendations forward in ways that will give impacted communities a voice on the future of these closed sites.”</p>
<p>The primary development objective for the redevelopment of the Downstate Correctional Facility is to maximize benefits to the surrounding community and region while prioritizing housing. Following the governor&#8217;s directive and in accordance with recommendations from the Unlocking Opportunity report, the RFP places a strong emphasis on housing in a mix of unit sizes and affordability ranges and makes up to $8 million in incentives available to eligible respondents to address remediation and demolition costs.</p>
<p>The RFP states, “The primary development objectives for the project are to maximize benefits to the surrounding community and generate the highest economic return for the state. These benefits may include housing, commercial activity, and job creation. When proposing mixed-use development with contextual multifamily housing serving a range of income levels, market rate units should cross subsidize affordable housing units.”</p>
<p>The former maximum-security site at 121 Red Schoolhouse Road covers approximately 80 acres of land, 50 of which are within the perimeter security and 30 of which are outside. There are 34 buildings on the property, totaling 558,000 square feet. The site is located in the Town of Fishkill and is adjacent to the City of Beacon. It is approximately 70 miles north of New York City and approximately 95 miles south of Albany.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[“The recovery has not taken place, but the housing recession is over,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, “The presence of multiple offers implies that housing demand is not being satisfied due to lack of supply. Homebuilders are ramping up production and hiring workers.”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales registered a modest increase of 0.3% in June from the previous month—the first increase since February—the National Association of Realtors reported today (July 27). The South and West posted monthly losses, while sales in the Northeast and Midwest grew marginally. All four U.S. regions saw year-over-year declines in transactions.</p>
<p>“The recovery has not taken place, but the housing recession is over,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, “The presence of multiple offers implies that housing demand is not being satisfied due to lack of supply. Homebuilders are ramping up production and hiring workers.”</p>
<p>The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI)—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—rose 0.3% to 76.8 in June. Year-over-year, pending transactions fell by 15.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p>
<p>NAR forecasts that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will hit 6.4% this year and then decline to 6.0% in 2024, while the unemployment rate will rise slightly to 3.7% in 2023 before increasing to 4.1% in 2024.</p>
<p>“With consumer price inflation calming close to the Federal Reserve’s desired conditions, mortgage rates look to have topped out,” Yun added. “Given the ongoing job additions, any meaningful decline in mortgage rates could lead to a rush of buyers later in the year and into the next.”</p>
<p>NAR expects existing-home sales to decrease 12.9% from 2022 to 2023, settling at 4.38 million, before climbing 15.5%, to 5.06 million in 2024. Compared to last year, national median existing-home prices will remain steady—declining 0.4%, to $384,900, before rebounding by 2.6% next year, to $395,000. The West, the country’s most expensive region, will see reduced prices while the more affordable Midwest region is likely to see a small, positive increase. Housing starts will drop 5.3% from 2022 to 2023, to 1.47 million, before increasing to 1.55 million, or 5.4%, in 2024.</p>
<p>“It is critical to expand supply as much as possible to widen access to homebuying for more Americans,” Yun said. “Home prices will be influenced by how much inventory is brought to market. Increased homebuilding will tame price growth, while limited construction will lead to home price appreciation outpacing income growth.”</p>
<p>Newly constructed home sales will increase from last year by 12.3% in 2023, to 720,000 due to additional inventory in this segment of the market and increase by another 13.9% in 2024, to 820,000. The national median new home price will decrease by 1.9% this year, to $449,100, and then improve by 4.2% next year, to $468,000.</p>
<p><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>The Northeast PHSI ascended 0.6% from last month to 67.1, a decrease of 16.7% from June 2022. The Midwest index jumped 4.3% to 77.6 in June, down 17.1% from one year ago.</p>
<p>The South PHSI receded 1.4% to 93.3 in June, lessening 14.3% from the prior year. The West index fell 1.0% in June to 57.7, dipping 15.5% from May 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NYACK—Matt McAllister, an agent with Corcoran Baer &amp; McIntosh in Nyack and COO at Statewide Abstract, embarked on a 142-mile bike ride earlier this month to fundraise for the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation (HGRF). McAllister, who also chairs the HGRF Project Committee that plans volunteer events, will ride in the Steamboat Gravel bike race in Steamboat Springs, CO.</p>
<p>The world-class gravel race also accumulates more than 10,000 feet of elevation gain. “This won’t be the longest bike ride I’ve ever done, but thanks to the elevation and over 100 of the miles being on gravel roads, I do expect it to be the hardest,” he explained.</p>
<p>Because of his involvement with HGRF, McAllister decided to get personally involved to raise awareness about how the foundation is making an impact in our region. &#8220;I’m choosing to raise money for HGRF because I have seen firsthand how thankful these organizations are for our grants and how far the money goes,” he said. “There is a direct impact in the communities we serve in the real estate industry, and I think it is our responsibility to give back and support the health and happiness of our fellow citizens.”</p>
<p>In 2020, McAllister completed his own course consisting of a 204-mile bike trek through the Hudson Valley, across the George Washington Bridge, and through Manhattan and Queens, while finishing in Long Island. That ride raised money for the Hillside Food Outreach, which provides in-home food delivery for those in need in Westchester, Putnam, and Fairfield counties.</p>
<p>Five years earlier, he completed a 70-mile Half Ironman Triathlon in Maryland. The event involved a 1.2-mile swim, 56-mile bike ride and 13.1-mile run. McAllister ran his first 50K (30-miles) marathon through Harriman State Park in Orange and Rockland counties in 2017 and in 2019, he ran a 50-mile marathon in New Paltz.</p>
<p>The HG Realtor Foundation supports qualified, community-based charities that serve the housing, hunger, health, happiness, and humane needs of those throughout the Hudson Valley and beyond. The money raised is distributed as grants to charities and non-profit organizations to help feed, cloth, shelter and provide job training for the less fortunate in our communities.</p>
<p>At press time, McAllister had raised $2,706 from 30 contributors. To contribute to McAllister’s fundraising efforts, please visit <a href="https://gofund.me/6f5e3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gofund.me/6f5e3781</a></p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Foreign buyers purchased $53.3 billion worth of U.S. existing homes from April 2022 through March 2023, slipping 9.6% from the previous 12-month period, according to a new report released by the National Association of Realtors on August 1.</p>
<p>Foreign buyers purchased 84,600 properties, down 14.2% from the prior year and the fewest number of homes bought since 2009, when NAR began tracking this data. Overall, U.S. existing-home sales totaled 5.03 million in 2022, down 17.8% from 2021.</p>
<p>“Sharply lower housing inventory in the U.S. and higher borrowing costs across the world have dented international buying for two straight years,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, recovering international travel following the end of the pandemic will bring more foreign transactions in coming months and years.”</p>
<p>NAR&#8217;s 2023 Profile of International Transactions in U.S. Residential Real Estate surveyed members about transactions with international clients who purchased and sold U.S. residential property from April 2022 through March 2023. Foreign buyers who resided in the U.S. as recent immigrants or who were holding visas that allowed them to live in the U.S. purchased $23.4 billion worth of U.S. existing homes, a 31.4% decrease from the prior year and representing 44% of the dollar volume of purchases. Foreign buyers who lived abroad purchased $29.9 billion worth of existing homes, up 20% from the 12 months prior and accounting for 56% of the dollar volume. International buyers accounted for 2.3% of the $2.3 trillion in existing-home sales during that period.</p>
<p>The average ($639,900) and median ($396,400) existing-home sales prices among international buyers were the highest ever recorded by NAR—and 7% and 8.3% higher, respectively, than the previous year. The increase in prices for foreign buyers reflects the increase in U.S. home prices, as the median sales price for all U.S. existing homes was $384,200. At $1.23 million, Chinese buyers had the highest average purchase price, with a third—33%—purchasing property in California. In total, 15% percent of foreign buyers purchased properties worth more than $1 million from April 2022 to March 2023.</p>
<p>China and Canada remained first and second in U.S. residential sales dollar volume at $13.6 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, continuing a trend going back to 2013. Mexico ($4.2 billion), India ($3.4 billion) and Colombia ($0.9 billion) rounded out the top five.</p>
<p>“Home purchases from Chinese buyers increased after China relaxed the world&#8217;s strictest pandemic lockdown policy, while buyers from India were helped by the country&#8217;s strong GDP growth,” Yun added. “A stronger Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar likely contributed to the rise in sales from Mexican buyers.”</p>
<p>For the 15th consecutive year, Florida remained the top destination for foreign buyers, accounting for 23% of all international purchases. California and Texas tied for second (12% each), followed by North Carolina, Arizona and Illinois (4% each).</p>
<p>“Florida, Texas and Arizona continue to attract foreign buyers despite the hot weather conditions during the summer and the significant spike in home prices that began a few years ago,” Yun said.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 42% of international buyer transactions compared to 26% of all existing-home buyers. Non-resident foreign buyers (52%) were more likely to make an all-cash purchase than resident foreign buyers (32%). Two-thirds of Colombian buyers (67%) made all-cash purchases, the highest share among the top five foreign buyer nations. Approximately half of Canadian (51%) and Chinese (47%) buyers made all-cash purchases. Asian Indian buyers were the least likely to pay all cash, at just 15%.</p>
<p>Half of foreign buyers purchased their property for use as a vacation home, rental property, or both—up from 44% the previous year. Almost three out of five international buyers (59%) purchased detached, single-family homes.</p>
<p>“Fostering economic investment in culturally dynamic communities, businesses, and industry is a top priority for NAR,” said Charlie Dawson, NAR&#8217;s vice president of engagement and advocacy outreach. “Our work across the country provides members and their communities with tools, resources and data to identify and highlight international investment opportunities in U.S. real estate. This acts as a key pillar in our efforts to further support local communities to drive economic development in markets across the country. NAR and the Realtor brand has developed a network of partnerships with over 100 real estate organizations across 77 countries providing growth opportunities by ensuring ethical and accessible markets that allow our members to make direct connections with global real estate professionals and international investors.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[While February and March were slightly better, at 29.4% and 28.9% drops respectively, April’s numbers fared much healthier than January’s, with a reported 41% decrease in luxury home sales.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The luxury housing market in the New York metro area remains icy with scarce inventory, as mortgage interest rates continue to rise. The latest data from the National Association of Realtors indicates a 36.5% drop in sales of properties over $1 million in April.</p>
<p>While February and March were slightly better, at 29.4% and 28.9% drops respectively, April’s numbers fared much healthier than January’s, with a reported 41% decrease in luxury home sales.</p>
<p>A recent Redfin report notes that luxury U.S. home sales have declined a record 44.6% year-over-year to the second lowest level on record during the three months ended in January this year. The report defines luxury homes as those estimated to be in the top 5% based on market value. Other factors being blamed for the slowdown include a tendency for people to be more diligent about finances during economic uncertainty, a turbulent stock market and wealthier Americans choosing to invest in other assets.</p>
<p>In the New York metro area, Redfin indicates that luxury homes sold year-over-year were down 44.4%, and new listings declined by 18.7%. However, the good news is that home prices are on the rise, with the area seeing a 10% growth to a median sale price of $3.625 million.</p>
<p>Hope Ross Mazzola, an Associate Broker with William Raveis-New York, LLC in Katonah, is experiencing that price growth firsthand—she currently holds the listing for the highest priced home in Westchester County at $100 million. Stonewall Farm, located in Granite Springs, is a 24,000-square-foot mansion built in 2004 and boasting 12 bathrooms, eight bedrooms, and 740 acres divided into 18 parcels of lawns, fenced paddocks, equestrian training facilities, barns and sheds, as well as guest and staff quarters. The world-class equestrian facilities represent the largest privately held parcel in Westchester.</p>
<div id="attachment_45301" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45301" class="wp-image-45301" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Library.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p id="caption-attachment-45301" class="wp-caption-text">The two-story Library at Stonewall Farm. <br /> PHOTO COURTESY OF WILLIAM RAVEIS-NEW YORK LLC, KATONAH</p></div>
<p>A 4,000-square-foot pavilion style pool house with a 60-foot swimming pool, lounge area, fireplace, spa, gym, changing rooms and kitchen is located just adjacent to the main house. Other distinctive features include a two-story library with 24-foot-high fireplace, an indoor Zen garden, a 2,200-bottle wine cellar and tasting room, a pub and game room, and state-of-the-art security and technology systems.</p>
<p>In addition, a unique 36,000-square-foot building occupies the northwest portion of the property. Formerly the Granite Springs Bottling Co., the property represents a huge opportunity for an automobile collector’s showroom, residential development or recreation use.</p>
<p>Although sales are down, Mazzola indicates the luxury market is still strong. “We are moving at approximately the same pace for the most luxurious and most coveted locations of waterfront in Rye, Mamaroneck and Larchmont to village properties in Bronxville and Scarsdale to sprawling estates in North Salem, Bedford, Katonah and Pound Ridge,” she said. “We’re in a very stable pricing market but there’s just not a lot of inventory. We have had a tough year with interest rates rising, and inflation and that’s feeding into the luxury market as well.”</p>
<p>From June 2022 to June 2023, there were 574 homes sold in Westchester in the $2-million-plus range. That’s down significantly from 686 homes in the same price range from June 2021 to June 2022.</p>
<p>At press time, Stonewall Farm, her $100-million listing in Granite Springs, has had several showings and interest from both domestic and international potential buyers. Recently, Mazzola listed a new home currently under construction in Bedford Corners for $3.8 million. “I’ve already been getting a lot of phone calls on this and I fully expect we’re going to have a buyer before it’s completed in the fall,” she added.</p>
<p>Christian Perry, an agent with Sotheby’s International Realty in Greenwich, CT, is dealing with some homeowners who are reluctant to sell because they worry about being able to purchase another property in the area. Many of those who do sell are renting homes in the interim, and the price tags can be extremely high. One of his Greenwich rentals—a single-family home with almost 4,000 square feet, eight bathrooms, seven bedrooms, and a large outdoor swimming pool—is currently on the market for $35,000 per month.</p>
<p>“I also recently had an Old Greenwich property for sale at $6.5 million with multiple offers—all cash,” he said. “Unfortunately, the owners took the house off the market because they couldn’t find another house in the area to move into.”</p>
<p>Perry said most of today’s luxury market deals are in cash. “In order for people to be competitive, they offer cash,” he explained. “In some cases, people will liquidate their securities, use the cash to buy the property, and then take a mortgage later to replace the cash.”</p>
<p>One of his other listings for sale is a farmhouse in Armonk, now on the market for $1.75 million. The property sits on almost nine acres and offers four bedrooms, three-and-a-half bathrooms, and more than 3,500 square feet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some luxury properties are moving. Just recently, Christie’s International Real Estate Westchester/Hudson Valley announced a record $5.8-million sale of “Villa Nuits” in Irvington.</p>
<p>Danielle Reese, Associate Broker in the Scarsdale Sales Gallery, represented the buyer of this property—the third highest price realized in Irvington on record and the highest price in all of the Rivertowns in the past 12 months. “I am very proud to have represented the buyer in the sale of this spectacular property, one with such a wonderful provenance. This iconic, Gilded Age Hudson River estate, has long been considered to be among the most beautiful in Westchester County,” said Reese.</p>
<div id="attachment_45303" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45303" class="wp-image-45303" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Villa-Nuits.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p id="caption-attachment-45303" class="wp-caption-text">Villa Nuits in Irvington, which recently sold for $5.8 million, a record amount for the village. <br /> PHOTO COURTESY OF CHRISTIE’S INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE WESTCHESTER/HUDSON VALLEY</p></div>
<p>Located at 2 Clifton Place in Irvington, the home offers more than 12,000 square feet of living space, including nine bedrooms, eight full baths and three half baths and almost five acres of sprawling grounds with winter views of the Hudson River. “Villa Nuits” was built in the early 1850s by Francis Cottenet, a wealthy, dry goods merchant and importer from France, and was designed by European-trained, Detlef Lienau. After Cottenet’s passing in 1884, the home was briefly owned by Cyrus W. Field and John Jacob Astor III.</p>
<p>The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and has been the setting for films, such as Martin Scorsese’s 1993 “Age of Innocence” with actors Winona Ryder and Daniel Day-Lewis and in 2016, for “The Wilde Wedding” with Glenn Close.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, novelist Erica Jong’s Upper East Side co-op was just listed for $4.25 million. Jong is best known for her 1973 hit novel, “Fear of Flying.” The almost 3,000-square-foot home was listed by Maria Daou of Coldwell Banker Warburg, who is also her niece. Located on the 27th floor in the highly sought-after Imperial House, the apartment offers breathtaking open panoramic views of the New York City skyline.</p>
<p>A 30-foot-long gallery at the entrance leads to a spacious, sunny south-facing living room with a custom bookcase spanning the length of the room. The grand gallery also leads to the enclosed solarium, showcasing sweeping vistas of Central Park and the city skyline.</p>
<p>The updated kitchen is spacious, featuring stainless steel countertops and appliances, an extra pantry and walk-in closet. Additional spaces include a small office nook and a small room with a full bath and a washer/dryer. The primary bedroom includes an en-suite bath and oversized closet space. The second bedroom offers a king-size bed, a walk-in closet, and an adjacent bathroom.</p>
<p>Designed by Emory Roth &amp; Sons, Imperial House features sought-after amenities and services, including concierge service, full-time doorman and elevator operators, a state-of-the-art fitness center, yoga studio, game room, an on-premises tailor/dressmaker.</p>
<p>As for the remainder of 2023, Perry is optimistic for a good fall market. “I think people are going to start realizing that even with elevated interest rates, this is the new normal,” he said. “At some point, they can always refinance, and it’s not like back in the 1980s when interest rates were at an all-time high of up to 18%.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>HARRISON—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul was joined by leaders from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and officials from residential development firm AvalonBay Communities on Aug. 7 in announcing the completion of Avalon Harrison, a transit-oriented development located at the Harrison Metro-North Railroad station built with support from the MTA.</p>
<p>“My administration is continuing to do everything in our power to build new housing in every corner of this state,” Gov. Hochul said. “With more than 140 units of affordable housing, the Avalon Harrison project does not only fit seamlessly into the community—it promises to make Harrison more dynamic and walkable and serve as a model for transit-oriented development everywhere.</p>
<p>Avalon Harrison, built at the Metro-North Railroad Harrison Station, includes: 143 apartments in three residential buildings, including seven affordable apartments subsidized by Westchester County; approximately 5,000 square feet of interior amenities for the residential community; approximately 27,000 square feet of vibrant, street-level retail/commercial space; two landscaped public plazas with connections to the Metro-North Harrison Station platform; 758 total project parking spaces ; 475 Metro-North Customer Parking spaces (an increase of 218 or 85%); 96 retail parking spaces  and 187 residential parking spaces.</p>
<p>Transit-oriented development is intended to promote downtown revitalization and improve the environment and healthy lifestyles by providing residents access to shops, amenities, and rail stations within walking distance. The MTA is continuing to advance transit-oriented developments, with another active project underway in Westbury.</p>
<p>MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said, “This (Harrison) project is a perfect example of what is meant when the phrase TOD, Transit Oriented Development, is used. We’ve got housing, beautiful new housing, close to transit so people don&#8217;t have to own as many cars and they don&#8217;t have to use them as frequently. As the governor said, these are the units that are custom designed for seniors who want to get out of that big house that&#8217;s now too big for them, but want to stay close to their friends in the community they&#8217;ve cultivated their whole lives.”</p>
<p>Metro-North President and Long Island Rail Road Interim President Catherine Rinaldi said, “The completion of this beautiful complex completely transforms the area around Harrison Station and will attract new customers to the cleaner and greener public transportation that Metro-North provides. Instead of just being a place to come and go quickly, Harrison station is now a destination and an example of how we can transform cities and increase the use of public transportation with Transit Oriented Development.”</p>
<p>The first phase of the two-phase project opened Aug. 23, 2021, and included the construction of a 598-space commuter parking garage located steps away from the Harrison station’s Connecticut-bound platform. The garage is owned and operated by Metro-North.</p>
<p>The Harrison project is expected to be a transformative project for the station and the central business district of Harrison and is a three-way win for the partnership. On the public sector side, MTA now has improved station access (increased parking, improved pedestrian flow with direct access to the outbound platform from the garage); an enhanced station environment with retail shops along the frontage of Halstead Avenue and in the plazas/courtyard; and increased residential density within walking distance to the station for potential ridership increases; all while avoiding any capital cost, New York State officials noted.</p>
<p>The project benefits the Town/Village of Harrison with a potential economic catalyst for the central business district and tax revenues from property that was previously public owned.</p>
<p>Harrison currently has 98 trains per weekday and 75 on Saturdays and Sundays, generally offering service every 30 minutes toward Manhattan and Stamford during off-peak hours and every 20 minutes during peak hours.</p>
<p>Avalon Harrison complements Gov. Hochul’s agenda to strengthen New York’s housing supply and make the state more affordable and more livable. The Governor recently announced a package of executive actions to promote housing growth across New York State. As part the FY 2023 Budget, the governor also secured funding for a five-year, $25-billion housing plan to create and preserve 100,000 affordable homes in urban and rural areas across New York.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency provided $1.35 million to the mixed-use, transit-oriented development that was valued at the time at nearly $77 million.</p>
<p>The success of the Harrison Avalon project is being followed by other TOD development projects at Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations, which are being constructed in conformance with recently enacted municipal rezonings.</p>
<p>The MTA is currently working with the Village of Westbury in Nassau County to bring a mixed-use residential development on the LIRR-owned commuter parking lot south of the Westbury Station following multi-billion-dollar MTA investments in LIRR. The MTA continues to work with communities that have committed to improve and activate their station areas by rezoning to allow greater density and mixed uses.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS, NY &#8211; The Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS® (HGAR) is excited to announce that the National Association of REALTORS®’ Realtors Relief Foundation (RRF) has approved our grant request for a half million dollars to help REALTOR® members and residents throughout the Hudson Valley affected by the flash flooding on July 9 and 10.</p>
<p>Each household affected by this disaster is eligible for up to $2,000 towards mortgage, rent, or hotel expenses due to displacement. Orange County was initially declared a State Disaster Emergency by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, as the Town of Highlands suffered severe damage. Dutchess, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester were later added to the list, along with several other counties. To be eligible, recipients must be full-time residents in the affected areas and either a U.S. citizen or legally admitted for residence in the U.S.</p>
<p>“REALTORS® don’t just live and work in our communities – we give back to them. As a REALTOR®, I am proud of what our REALTOR® Relief Foundation has done over the last 21 years to help restore and rebuild communities across the United States that have been devastated by disasters,” said Tony D’Anzica, HGAR President. “The Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS® has been a long-time contributor to the Foundation and we are grateful to have the Foundation&#8217;s support now that our own communities are in need. We want the members of the communities we serve to know that, in more ways than they might realize, our REALTOR® family works every day to help them.”</p>
<p>“I very much appreciate the assistance from HGAR,” said Highland Falls Mayor Joseph D’Onofrio. “It is so much needed, with folks being displaced from their homes and hundreds of others in need.”</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus also expressed his support for HGAR’s efforts. “Hard-working Orange County families suffered major damage to their homes and hardships due to last month’s storm. This assistance will be beneficial to them, and I want to thank HGAR for stepping up and helping our communities to rebuild after this major weather event,” he said.</p>
<p>Residents in those areas who sustained flood damage may apply for one of the following options:</p>
<p>• Monthly mortgage expense for the primary residence that was affected.<br />
• Rental cost due to displacement from the primary residence.<br />
• Hotel reimbursement due to displacement from primary residence.</p>
<p>Financial assistance is awarded for housing only. Second mortgages, home equity loans, clothing, appliances, equipment or vehicle purchase, rental or repair are not eligible under this program.</p>
<p>All applicants will be required to submit photo IDs to show proof of residency, such as a driver’s license or other documentation, as well as a copy of the mortgage statement, lease agreement or hotel receipt. In addition, photos of damages, insurance estimates, claim status reports or copies of repair estimates must also be submitted as proof of damage to the primary residence.</p>
<p>For more information on how to apply for these grants, please visit <a href="http://www.hgar.com/realtors-relief-foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.hgar.com/realtors-relief-foundation</a>.</p>
<p>NAR’s REALTOR® Relief Foundation dates back to 2001 following the September 11 terrorist attacks. NAR’s Executive Leadership team launched the program to secure contributions to help those who were impacted. Since that time, they have been providing housing assistance relief to victims of natural disasters throughout the nation. The Foundation has awarded over $40 million in total, funding 100 disaster recoveries in 43 states, and helping more than 20,000 families.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS® is one of the largest Associations in the country, representing over 13,000 REALTORS® in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, and Orange counties, as well as Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As the Professional Standards Administrator for HGAR, I often speak about the Code of Ethics (COE) and filing complaints. I thought I would use this month’s article to go over the process of filing a complaint and what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Before You File</strong></p>
<p>Before you file a complaint, we encourage you to reach out to the Realtor and/or the Realtor’s manager/broker to see if you can resolve the issue<strong> BEFORE</strong> filing a complaint. If both parties are willing to agree to meet to try to resolve this matter with a mediator/ombudsman, we can arrange that at no charge to either party. If you are unable to resolve your matter, you are still free to file a complaint.</p>
<p><strong>The Complaint</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, all complaints and the hearing process are strictly confidential. Additionally, you cannot file a complaint anonymously.</p>
<p>Next, the COE identifies 17 Articles and each one is relatively short. Various Standards of Practice are under each Article and these are simply commonly identified acts that violate the Article. However, when filing a complaint, you should only cite the specific Article. You can reference the Standard of Practice elsewhere, but not in the complaint.</p>
<p>The complaint form is a one-page document. It must be completely filled out, identifying HGAR as the Association, the date, and the names of the parties. The Realtor filing the complaint is the “complainant.” The Realtor that you are filing the complaint against (i.e., the evil-doer) is the “respondent.” You then must identify the Article(s) that you believe the respondent violated. You must sign and date the form and provide your contact information. Most important, you must file your complaint within 180 days after you learn of the facts (or could have known of the facts with reasonable due diligence) or within 180 days after the conclusion of the transaction or event, whichever is later. Additionally, you must also identify whether there are any other actions/litigation that may be taking place related to the complaint.</p>
<p>In filling out the complaint, you are also agreeing to appear for a hearing if the matter is approved. Currently, those hearings are done virtually, but they may become in-person in the future. At these hearings, you are free to have legal counsel and/or Realtor counsel present, but it is not required.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrative and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When you file a complaint, you are required to provide a typewritten explanation of what happened. It should be as detailed as possible and you can include any Standards of Practice that you think apply. You should also provide evidence. This may be emails, texts, documents, photos, affidavits, contracts, etc. You should provide as much support as you can, but you can always add more later. You can also identify witnesses who will come in and testify.</p>
<p><strong>Review by the Grievance Committee</strong></p>
<p>Once the complaint is received, it will be presented to the Grievance Committee (a neutral review board). They look at the timing of the complaint (180-day limit) and, for purposes of their review only, they will assume the facts to be true and compare them to the Article(s) identified to determine if there is an actionable complaint that can go forward to a Professional Standards Hearing Panel. If it goes forward, a hearing will be scheduled and the complaint will be sent to the respondent for their reply, narrative and a request for their supporting proof in opposition to the complaint. If the Grievance Committee determines that the complaint is not valid, then they will dismiss the complaint, and the process ends. However, a complainant may appeal this decision and they will be afforded an opportunity to explain why the complaint is valid.</p>
<p>If a respondent wishes to avoid a hearing, they can fill out a form which basically admits to the violation and the matter advances directly to a hearing on discipline. Additionally, in the very near future, HGAR will be implementing a Citation Policy, wherein respondents who violate certain common Articles/Standards of Practice may avoid a hearing and the respondent will be assessed a set fine, as determined by a Citation Panel (a neutral review board), so long as the respondent agrees to it; otherwise, a full hearing will be held.</p>
<p><strong>The Hearing</strong></p>
<p>Both parties will appear before the Professional Standards Hearing Panel (again, a neutral review board) along with any counsel and witnesses. The Hearing Panel will have already reviewed both the complaint, the response, and all the evidence provided up to that point. At the hearing, which is like a mini-trial, the complainant presents its case, along with any evidence, witnesses, etc. The complainant has the burden of proof in proving the claim. For an ethics hearing, the standard is “clear, strong and convincing” which is defined as enough proof that will produce a firm belief as to the allegations alleged.  At the end of the hearing, the parties will be dismissed and the Hearing Panel will go into Executive Session to deliberate and render a decision. If they determine there is no violation, then the decision will reflect that. If the respondent is found in violation of the Code of Ethics, then they will proceed to determine discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline</strong></p>
<p>The Code of Ethics and Arbitration Manual is quite specific as to what can be handed down as discipline. Further, the discipline must be proportionate with the violation. Discipline can range from the lightest discipline, which is a letter of warning, and increase up to a letter of reprimand, then to requiring reeducation (i.e., ethics or agency classes), and may even include a fine (which can be from $1.00 up to $15,000). Discipline can even include membership suspension. Discipline can be a combination of these as well. For example, a letter of reprimand, two hours of ethics training, and a $500 fine might be in order for a respondent who knowingly violated the Code of Ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong></p>
<p>Once the Hearing Panel renders a decision, the parties will be notified. Either party may appeal the decision. If there is no appeal, the decision is sent to the Board of Directors, with the names and any identifying information removed, and the Board will ratify the decision. However, if the Board of Directors believes the discipline was improper, they can reduce it (they cannot increase it) or they may send it back to the Hearing Panel with a recommendation and ask that it be reviewed again; however, the Hearing Panel does not have to accept the recommendation. If they believe that the hearing was procedurally deficient, they can refer the matter back for a new hearing. Last, if the Board of Directors determines that the findings of fact do not support a violation of the Code of Ethics, they can dismiss the matter. Once the Board of Directors ratifies the decision, it becomes effective and any discipline will be imposed.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<p>A respondent may file an appeal on the grounds that the Hearing Panel misapplied/misinterpreted the Code of Ethics, they were denied due process, or that the discipline was too severe. A complainant can only appeal if they believe that they did not receive a fair hearing (lack of due process). Anyone who wishes to appeal the decision must fill out a form and pay a filing fee. The appeal is then presented to a neutral panel of five Board of Director Members who are given the decision and all the materials presented at the earlier hearing. At the appeal, the Hearing Panel Chair will be present to provide his/her recitation of the facts and the reasoning that brought about the Hearing Panel’s determination. Then the person making the appeal (appellant) will make their argument. In most appeals, no new evidence can be submitted.</p>
<p>At the conclusion, the appeal panel will deliberate and decide to grant or deny the appeal. If the appeal is denied, the decision of the Hearing Panel stands and the matter will go to the Board of Directors for ratification. If the appeal is granted, and the issue was the severity of the discipline, then the appeal panel may reduce the discipline or send the decision back with a recommendation that the discipline be reduced (again, the Hearing Panel does not have to follow the recommendation). If the appeal is related to an unfair hearing, then the appeal panel will send the matter back for a new hearing with a new Hearing Panel. If it is determined that the findings of fact do not support the Hearing Panel’s decision, they can dismiss the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All Realtors are required to comply with the Code of Ethics. Filing an ethics complaint is a very simple process and it provides confidentiality for all parties. Each party is given a fair opportunity to represent themselves before a neutral party and there are plenty of protections and “safety nets” to ensure expediency, fairness, completeness and closure. Discipline is fair and just.</p>
<p>If you wish to file a complaint or you have questions relating to filing a complaint, please reach out to HGAR for guidance.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, and try again.</p>
<p>New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced on Aug. 8 that the redevelopment of the long vacant Kingsbridge Armory in the South Bronx will move forward with the release of Request for Proposals by the New York City Economic Development Corp. next month.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of plans to redevelop the Kingsbridge Armory, which first opened in 1917 during World War I, is estimated by city and state officials as possibly generating up to $10 billion in economic impact for the Bronx and more than 1,000 construction jobs, follows an extensive community-led process over the past nine months.</p>
<p>At a press conference, Gov, Hochul, Mayor Adams, New York City Economic Development Corporation President and CEO Andrew Kimball, and community leaders unveiled guiding principles for the “Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan,” outlining next steps for a process that will include the redevelopment of the historic and long-underutilized Kingsbridge Armory, which has been vacant except for special uses since 1996 when the city took ownership of the property.</p>
<p>The Kingsbridge Armory opened in 1917 and was used by the United States military until 1994 before reverting to city ownership in 1996. The armory was designated as a New York City Landmark in 1974 and placed on the National Register for Historic Places list in 1982. For the past 27 years, the armory has been vacant, but was utilize during the COVID-19 public health crisis, served as a temporary food distribution center and, early last year, was used by Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson and local officials to store supplies for those impacted by the tragic Twin Park North fire.</p>
<p>The project site occupies most of the block bounded by West 195th Street, Reservoir Avenue, West Kingsbridge Road, and Jerome Avenue. The site is largely occupied by the Armory building that totals more than 570,000 square feet, including a 180,000-square-foot drill hall and an 8,000-seat auditorium.</p>
<p>&#8220;After years of dwelling on the history of the Kingsbridge Armory, we are finally looking ahead to its remarkable future,&#8221; Gov. Hochul said. &#8220;I know how critical the future of the Armory is to this community and to the entire borough of The Bronx, which is why I prioritized locking in $100 million in state funding that will allow this transformative project to move forward. Working with local leaders and our partners in the City of New York, the Kingsbridge Armory will anchor this neighborhood, address longstanding community needs, and boost the local economy and I anticipate a Project Labor Agreement to create good-paying union jobs at this site as we work to bring this project to fruition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Backed by a $200 million investment by the state and New York City, the redevelopment could deliver more than 1,800 jobs, including 1,100 construction jobs, and up to $10 billion in economic impact to the Bronx based on initial estimates, state officials noted.</p>
<p>“The Kingsbridge Armory is a tremendous public asset that is not serving the community. This project has the potential to unlock billions in economic impact for the city while creating over 1,800 good jobs right here in the Bronx,” said Mayor Adams. “And after sitting down with more than 4,000 Bronxites over the past nine months, we are proud to deliver their vision for the armory’s next chapter: a source for good union jobs and a beacon of opportunity for the Bronx.”</p>
<p>Since 1996 a number of redevelopment plans have been proposed, including plans for a large ice rink complex and a major shopping center. However, local opposition and financing issues skuttled all previous proposals.</p>
<p>The “Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan” is the result of an extensive, community-driven process that kicked off in November 2022 and included a series of public workshops and engagement opportunities designed to develop a shared vision for how this tremendous public asset can support the neighborhood and the community’s economic development priorities.</p>
<p>The process resulted in the identification of preferred industries that community members believe would allow the armory to attract major private investment. Those preferred industries include film and television, sustainable manufacturing, emerging technologies and urban agriculture.</p>
<p>Community members also identified a set of complementary uses to provide equitable access to services and work opportunities for Bronx communities. Those complementary uses include: vocational training and a small business incubator; retail, food, and beverage uses; community gathering and organizing space; Bronx arts and culture space; recreation and health; and sustainable food systems. The community also stressed a desire for the project to hire local and union talent, sourced from Bronx-based businesses, and provide vocational training to residents.</p>
<p>The nine-month community engagement process reached over 4,000 people and consisted of more than 1,000 participants across four public workshops; more than 900 survey respondents; more than 500 community members touring the armory; nine community board meetings; 16 small group discussions; three public information sessions; and feedback from more than 75 industry stakeholders on the armory’s potential.</p>
<p>Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson said, “From the onset of our administration, we said we were committed to working with our community partners to reimagine the Kingsbridge Armory, and we are now one step closer to doing just that with the ‘Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan.’ This vision plan is not only a labor of love but is the result of months of planning, collaboration, input, and support from various stakeholders dedicated to ensuring Bronxites have a say in the future of the largest armory in our nation. It is exciting to see so many of our residents, merchants, elected officials, and community leaders participate in this process as well as their shared interest in making this a space that can not only benefit Kingsbridge Heights but the entire borough. When advocates, elected officials, community leaders, and stakeholders come together with the same vision and priorities, our borough wins. Reimagining the Kingsbridge Armory is a tremendous win for the Bronx, our city, and our state. I want to thank Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams for their significant capital investment in the armory as well as the NYCEDC, my colleagues in government, our Deputy Borough President Janet Peguero, community advocates, and everyone else with a vested interest in transforming and revitalizing the Kingsbridge Armory.”</p>
<p>According to the NYCEDC website, the agency is conducting site tours on Fridays from Aug. 11 through Aug. 25.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Two recent court cases, Striplin v. AC&E Home Inspection Corp. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Schepisi, have been decided in favor of the purchaser.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over the years, this column has reviewed various court decisions issued by New York courts on the doctrine of “Caveat Emptor” or “Buyer Beware,” which have usually been decided in favor of the seller. Two recent court cases, <em>Striplin v. AC&amp;E Home Inspection Corp.</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/45kseul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/45kseul</a>] and <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Schepisi</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Kxpf9W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Kxpf9W</a>], have been decided in favor of the purchaser.</p>
<p><strong>Striplin v. AC&amp;E Home Inspection Corp.</strong></p>
<p>In Striplin, the plaintiffs, who were the purchasers under a certain contract of sale between them and the sellers of residential property in Suffolk County, sued the sellers “to recover damages for fraud after allegedly discovering, subsequent to the closing, that the property had suffered extensive damage due to leaking water.” The purchasers alleged that the sellers had “actively concealed” certain water damage existing at the premises. The defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit, which the trial court granted, and the plaintiffs appealed the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat Emptor Doctrine Revisited</strong></p>
<p>The Appellate Division in Striplin, citing <em>Simone v Homecheck Real Estate Servs., Inc.</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3QqWC24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3QqWC24</a>], explained that “‘New York adheres to the doctrine of caveat emptor and imposes no liability on a seller for failing to disclose information regarding the premises when the parties deal at arm&#8217;s length, unless there is some conduct on the part of the seller which constitutes active concealment.’” The court in Simone explains that “The mere silence of the seller, without some act or conduct, which deceived the buyer, does not amount to a concealment that is actionable as a fraud.” A seller must actively engage in intentional acts or conduct that purposefully conceal a defect or adverse condition at a property in order to be liable for fraud on the basis of active concealment.</p>
<p><strong>A Seller Cannot ‘Thwart’ a Purchaser’s </strong><strong>Ability to Conduct Inspections</strong></p>
<p>The court in Striplin further noted, quoting <em>Jablonski v. Rapalje </em>[see <a href="https://nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_00129.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_00129.htm</a>], that in order “‘To maintain a cause of action to recover damages for active concealment, the plaintiff must show, in effect, that the seller or the seller’s agents thwarted the plaintiff&#8217;s efforts to fulfill his [or her] responsibilities fixed by the doctrine of caveat emptor.” In essence, if a seller, or seller’s agent, actively “thwarts” a purchaser’s efforts to conduct inspections or the due diligence required by the doctrine of “Caveat Emptor,” then they can be held liable for damages.</p>
<p>In Striplin, the Appellate Division, in reversing the trial court’s dismissal of the purchaser’s lawsuit, relied on the purchasers’ affidavit, which alleged that the sellers “took measures to actively conceal the existence of leaks and water damage to the property, including placing new wood on top of rotten wood to hide the extent of the damage.” The Appellate Court held that “The plaintiffs&#8217; allegations, if true, might have thwarted the plaintiffs&#8217; efforts to fulfill their responsibilities imposed by the doctrine of caveat emptor with respect to the property,” and therefore, the trial court should not have dismissed the lawsuit. The Appellate Court further explained that the defendants were not able to establish “that a material fact alleged in the amended complaint is not a fact at all and that no significant dispute exists regarding it.” Here, the alleged actions by the sellers of installing new wood over the water damaged wood is potential evidence of an effort by sellers to “thwart” purchaser’s ability to discover the defects, and therefore, the court decided that the purchasers are entitled to proceed with their lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Can the PCDS be the Basis for a Claim of Misrepresentation?</strong></p>
<p>While not addressed directly in Striplin<em>, </em>a common question that arises in these cases of active concealment and fraudulent misrepresentation, is whether a seller can be held liable for misrepresentations made in the New York State Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). While it is common, at least in the southern parts of New York State, for sellers not to provide the PCDS and simply credit the purchaser with the $500 credit, sometimes sellers do complete a PCDS. Seller’s agents should make certain that they do not recommend to their seller client to complete the form. Rather, they should simply inform the seller clients that the PCDS law exists and recommend they discuss whether one should be completed or not with their attorneys. The purchasers in the Simone case (cited above) alleged that the sellers engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation and active concealment because they “knowingly” made false statements orally and in the PCDS.</p>
<p>The court in Simone points out that “When a seller makes a false representation in a Disclosure Statement, such a representation may be proof of active concealment.” However, the court goes on to state, “Where the contract specifically disclaims the existence of warranties or representations, a cause of action alleging breach of contract based on such a warranty or representation cannot be maintained.” Therefore, if a contract specifically provides that the “premises had been inspected by the buyer and was being sold &#8220;as is&#8221; without warranty as to condition, express or implied….[and] a specific merger clause is contained in…the contract and precludes the buyer from claiming that he relied on any of the sellers&#8217; alleged misrepresentations…, [a] cause of action to recover for breach of contract cannot be maintained.” Therefore, as suggested by the court in Simone<em>, </em>completing a PCDS could expose a seller to liability for active concealment and fraudulent misrepresentation, however, a well-drafted contract serves to protect a seller.</p>
<p><strong>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Schepisi: </strong><strong>The Doctrine of ‘Buyer Beware” is Limited in Specific Instances</strong></p>
<p><em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Schepisi</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Kxpf9W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Kxpf9W</a>] involved a residential real property owned by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which was the subject of a foreclosure sale. In 2015, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. commenced an action to foreclose on its subordinate mortgage. There also existed a first mortgage on the property. In 2018, a judgment of foreclosure and sale was entered by the Supreme Court in favor of Wells Fargo. A foreclosure sale was subsequently held, and Romina Rugova was the successful bidder. Rugova paid a $30,000 down payment to the referee and, prior to the closing,] Rugova (and Mucjon Demiraj) obtained a title report for the subject property. The title report disclosed the existence of the first mortgage. Rugova and Demiraj were not aware of the first mortgage until they obtained the title report.</p>
<p>Upon discovering the existence of the first mortgage, Rugova and Demeraj moved to set aside the foreclosure sale and requested that the $30,000 be returned to them. They also requested they be awarded the costs for certain repairs they made to the property while the property was still owned by Wells Fargo. The Supreme Court denied their motion and Rugova and Demeraj appealed the decision to the Appellate Division.</p>
<p><strong>‘Buyer Beware’ Does Not Apply to a Purchaser at Judicial Sale</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo argued that Rugova and Demeraj failed to exercise due diligence and that they should be required to proceed with the purchase. The Appellate Division, however, found this argument “unavailing.” Citing the Court of Appeals case <em>Lane v. Chantilly</em> (1929) [see <a href="https://casetext.com/case/lane-v-chantilly-corporation-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://casetext.com/case/lane-v-chantilly-corporation-1</a>], the Appellate Division held that “The rule that a buyer must protect himself [or herself] against undisclosed defects does not apply in all strictness to a purchaser at a judicial sale.” It further noted that “a sale of land in the haste and confusion of an auction room is not governed by the strict rules applicable to formal contracts made with deliberation after ample opportunity to investigate and inquire.’” Since Wells Fargo failed to disclose the existence of the first mortgage, the Appellate Division found that the purchasers were not required to complete the sale and ordered the down payment be returned to them. The court, however, did not award the purchasers the repair expenses they incurred because they were done without the permission of Wells Fargo and at their risk.</p>
<p><strong>Courts Have Discretion to Set Aside Judicial Sale in Equity</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Schepisi</em>, the Appellate Division, citing <em>Paragon Federal Credit Union v. Skarla</em> [see <a href="https://nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2020/2020_04751.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2020/2020_04751.htm</a>], also held that a court “has the discretion to set aside a judicial sale where fraud, collusion, mistake, or misconduct casts suspicion on the fairness of the sale.” The Appellate Division further held that it “may exercise its inherent equitable power over a sale made pursuant to its judgment or decree to ensure that it is not made the instrument of injustice.” [See <em>Guardian Loan Co. v Early</em> at <a href="https://casetext.com/case/guardian-loan-co-v-early" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://casetext.com/case/guardian-loan-co-v-early</a>]. Courts generally have the power in their “equitable” jurisdiction to decide matters based upon general principles of fairness, equity, and justice.</p>
<p>In Schepisi the court points out that “neither the complaint, the judgment of foreclosure and sale, nor the terms of sale affirmatively disclosed the existence of another mortgage encumbering the subject property or that the mortgage at issue was subordinate to the senior mortgage.” Ultimately, since this information was not provided to the successful bidders at the foreclosure sale, the court deemed it to be “a mistake or misconduct that cast ‘suspicion on the fairness of the sale.’” In essence, the court determined that Wells Fargo failed to disclose a material defect in the property’s title. While the doctrine of Caveat Emptor is the prevailing principle that governs real property sales in New York, the court determined that the failure to disclose this particular defect did not fall within the scope of the “buyer beware” doctrine, and ultimately decided the appeal in favor of the prospective purchasers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>One critical takeaway from these recent “Caveat Emptor” cases is that the doctrine of “Buyer Beware” is still alive and well, and that, except for very limited circumstances, purchasers must continue to be diligent and conduct thorough inspections of any property they wish to purchase. Buyer’s agents and attorneys must advise buyers to conduct extensive due diligence and inspections and inform them that their failure to do so will likely leave them with limited remedies against sellers. On the other hand, sellers, seller’s agents, and seller’s attorneys must ensure that appropriate disclaimers are included in the contracts, that a purchaser is never “thwarted” from conducting any inspections, and that sellers never actively conceal a defect that would make its discovery difficult or impossible in the course of ordinary inspections and due diligence.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—A broad-based coalition of 18 associations representing housing providers, lenders and residents sent a letter on Thursday, Aug. 10 to Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Sandra Thompson warning that mandatory rent control and rent stabilization policies will increase rents, reduce the capital needed to boost the supply of housing, and ultimately hurt current and future renters.</p>
<p>As FHFA considers changes for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed multifamily properties, the groups cautioned that rent control mandates will exacerbate the housing affordability crisis and that the best way to ease rising rents is to create voluntary incentives within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs to expand the supply of much-needed affordable housing.</p>
<p>The signatories, which included the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders and the National Multifamily Housing Council, asked FHFA to reject imposing rent regulation as a condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed financing and instead, create additional voluntary incentives within the GSE programs to expand the supply of needed affordable housing.</p>
<p>Research has proven repeatedly that mandatory rent control is a failed policy, which does nothing to alleviate the root causes of housing affordability issues—namely the fact that our nation’s housing supply has not kept pace with the needs of our growing population, the coalition stated. Rent stabilization disincentivizes rental multifamily housing investments across markets, particularly in communities of opportunity that already often have few affordable options.</p>
<p>Moreover, rent regulation is not equitable as it does not target lower- and moderate-income renters that are in most need of assistance, support and stability. Instead, it incentivizes current renters to remain in place for longer periods of time and disincentivizes additional investments in housing, thereby limiting opportunities for others who do not have access to the rental housing market in favor of those that already do.</p>
<p>This inequitable approach most impacts people of color who already have limited access to many housing markets, especially those with good schools, nearby public transportation and other amenities, the coalition charged.</p>
<p>Implementing rent control would be contrary to the goal and mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to create more affordable housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents. In fact, a February 2022 study indicated that only 27% of firms surveyed said that they would be willing to keep their current investments, or add new ones, in rent-controlled markets.</p>
<p>As FHFA considers policy reforms, rather than instituting counterproductive rent control measures, the agencies stated they were  strongly urge the agency to expand programs that increase the supply of housing, lower housing costs and enhance housing equity and availability.</p>
<p>Letter signatories included: American Seniors Housing Association, Council for Affordable and Rural Housing, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, Institute of Real Estate Management, Leading Builders of America, Manufactured Housing Institute, Mortgage Bankers Association, NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, National Apartment Association, National Association of Home Builders, Nareit, National Association of Realtors,National Association of Residential Property Managers, National Housing Conference, National Housing &amp; Rehabilitation Association, National Leased Housing Association, National Multifamily Housing Council and The Real Estate Roundtable.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[This month, I would like to bring to your attention an aspect of RPAC influence that goes under the radar]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>Believe it or not, there is an election this November.</p>
<p>This is referred to as an “Off-Off Election Year,” where town board members and county legislators are elected. Ultimately, we are in a hyper-local political season that hides in the shadow of the coming Presidential Election Year. I will not attempt to explain the nuances of local politics, nor will I start to prepare you for the politics of 2024…maybe next month.</p>
<p>This month, I would like to bring to your attention an aspect of RPAC influence that goes under the radar.</p>
<p>As many of you know, last month, the Hudson Valley was hit with severe thunderstorms and torrential rain that resulted in the destruction of many homes in and around the Highland Falls area of Orange County. In response to this storm, area HGAR members and our Interim CEO Jana Currier secured $500,000 in grant money for all households affected by this storm. Renters and homeowners can apply for a grant of up to $2,000 to offset mortgage, rent or hotel stay payments. Originally established after 9/11, the Realtors Relief Fund is designed to help individuals in tragedies such as this. Within a week of receiving the grant, HGAR staff, myself included, were on the ground in Highland Falls and the surrounding areas. A truly monumental task considering the quick turnaround and fluidity of receiving the grant monies.</p>
<p>What you might not know is how HGAR has been working behind the scenes in the aftermath of this devastating storm, speaking with almost every level of government from mayors to Congress members. When the thunderstorm passed and the devastation was assessed, local, state and federal officials started to consolidate resources. Almost immediately, HGAR was recognized as a community asset. Because of RPAC, HGAR is in regular contact with elected officials—mostly these interactions involve the status of bills, political fundraisers, and events like County Day. When the disaster struck, HGAR was quickly recognized not for our legislative clout, but for our commitment to the community’s good. Due to Jana’s initiative with local officials and our connections with Congressman Pat Ryan’s office, HGAR was invited to two resource fairs in the affected areas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what became painfully obvious was that FEMA and other government agencies were not going to be able to supply aid in a timely manner. Although HGAR could only provide $2,000 in grant money to each household, we were one of the only organizations at the resource fair that was able to provide financial support and local elected officials began referring residents to our table. It was truly heart-wrenching experience talking to individuals living in condemned houses and explaining their devastation and lack of options. Congressman Ryan’s office has been very appreciative of our ability to be on hand at the community resource fairs he organized.</p>
<p>I share this experience not to shame the lack of response from our government but to comment on the depth of the HGAR organization. To our elected officials, HGAR is not just known for its business interests or even our legislative goals, but as a community member. New York State Senator James Skoufis said it best when he attended our press conference and said, “I have been in government for a long time, but I have never interacted with an organization like HGAR.” Truly, we stand alone in business organizations in the area. I believe this recognition comes from our support of RPAC and our individual members that embody our ideals.</p>
<p>RPAC is the lifeblood of our industry. But what we do with that life blood is build and support community. We offer dynamic approaches and advocate for non-partisan solutions. RPAC and our individual efforts as Realtors and HGAR members allow us to be recognized for more than just our industry but for our humanity.</p>
<p>Dozens of families are receiving hope from the Realtors Relief Fund. Elected officials are turning to us to better connect with the community. HGAR is moving mountains and providing hope and we should take pride in what we do.</p>

<p>GOSHEN—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors was one of the first private organizations to provide much-needed financial assistance to homeowners in the flood-ravaged Highlands/West Point area and other sections of the Hudson Valley region that suffered significant damage from the devastating heavy rains on July 9-10.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors applied for and was approved for $500,000 in funding from the National Association of Realtors’ Realtors Relief Foundation to provide critical funds to Realtor members and residents throughout the Hudson Valley that were impacted by the flash flooding that damaged homes, washed out roads and bridges and knocked out power in a number of areas in Orange, Rockland, Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties. The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors announced the Realtors Relief Foundation award and funding availability at a press conference at HGAR’s Regional Office in Goshen on Aug. 8.</p>
<p>HGAR Acting CEO and Chief Operating Officer Jana Currier told<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> on Aug. 18 that since the association began processing Relief Foundation applications on Aug. 1, HGAR had reviewed and approved 26 applications for households impacted by the July 9-10 flood. The total amount approved to be disbursed thus far was $82,000 and 13 checks will or have been delivered by the weekend of Aug. 18-20 to residents in the Hudson Valley, she added.</p>
<div id="attachment_45459" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45459" class="wp-image-45459" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Patrick-Flynn.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-45459" class="wp-caption-text">Resident Patrick Flynn; Deborah Waters, Realtor with Howard Hanna|Rand Realty and resident of Highland Falls and on HGAR’s Relief Assistance Team and Jessica Mandakas, HGAR staff and member of HGAR’s Relief Assistance Team.</p></div>
<p>Each household affected by the disaster is eligible for up to $2,000 towards mortgage, rent, or hotel expenses due to displacement. Orange County was initially declared a State Disaster Emergency by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, as the Town of Highlands suffered severe damage. Dutchess, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester were later added to the list, along with several other upstate counties. To be eligible, recipients must be full-time residents in the affected areas and either a U.S. citizen or legally admitted for residence in the U.S. Currier said that it takes about four weeks from funding application to funding award.</p>
<p>“Realtors don’t just live and work in our communities—we give back to them. As a Realtor, I am proud of what our Realtors Relief Foundation has done over the last 21 years to help restore and rebuild communities across the United States that have been devastated by disasters,” said HGAR President Tony D’Anzica. “The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors has been a long-time contributor to the foundation and we are grateful to have the foundation’s support now that our own communities are in need. We want the members of the communities we serve to know that, in more ways than they might realize, our Realtor family works every day to help them.”</p>
<p>D’Anzica singled out Currier, the HGAR’s Relief Assistance Team and other HGAR staff, as well as all contributors to the Realtors Relief Foundation in making the humanitarian campaign possible.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven Neuhaus at the Aug. 8 press conference singled out HGAR for its past and current assistance in times of need. “Yet, again you guys have come and delivered for our community and the Hudson Valley,” he said. “I remember during the doldrum days of the (COVID) pandemic when everybody went underground, this association stepped up and came to the 911 Center and helped us with emergency PPE that we needed to get out to our first responders.”</p>
<p>He characterized the flood damage in the Highlands/Highland Falls, West Point, Woodbury, Cornwall as well as in locations on the eastern side of the Hudson was “devastating.” Neuhaus noted that while the federal and state governments are helping repair damaged infrastructure, the NAR Realtor Relief Foundation funding will be critical.</p>
<p>“People really need this boost. So, I am really grateful for you guys stepping up,” the County Executive said. “This is not something that happens all the time. We don’t have a million organizations that are constantly giving back. You guys are really at the top of the hill and are getting it done.”</p>
<p>Another speaker at the Aug. 8th HGAR press conference was New York State Senator James Skoufis (D-42nd District) of Cornwall, who discussed his long-standing relationship with the New York State Association of Realtors and the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, first as a State Assemblyman and now in the State Senate.</p>
<div id="attachment_45457" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45457" class="wp-image-45457" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RRF-Check-Presentation-Dana-and-William-Lloyd-with-Realtor-John-Willis.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="363" /><p id="caption-attachment-45457" class="wp-caption-text">From left, Realtor-John Willis of Howard Hanna| Rand Realty and a member of HGAR’s Relief Assistance Team and residents William and Dana Lloyd.</p></div>
<p>Terming the Realtors Relief Foundation campaign as “a big deal” in providing quick and needed assistance to impacted residents in the region, he noted, “Whenever there is a challenge on the ground here in Orange County, the Realtors are there. Whenever there is a problem legislatively that their members are dealing with and that they are seeing in their communities, they come to Albany, they are there and we work with them.</p>
<p>Sen. Skoufis continued, “So, it is no surprise to me that yet again, the Realtors are stepping up in a big way to help our neighbors here in Orange County.”</p>
<p>Both Town of Highlands Supervisor Bob Livsey and Highland Falls Deputy Mayor Jim DiSalvo described the devastation caused by the flash flooding in their communities and expressed their appreciation to HGAR for facilitating the much-needed Realtor Relief Foundation funding. “I very much appreciate the assistance from HGAR,” stated Highland Falls Mayor Joseph D’Onofrio. “It is so much needed, with folks being displaced from their homes and hundreds of others in need.”</p>
<p>Deborah Waters, a Realtor with Howard Hanna|Rand Realty and a resident of Highland Falls who attended the HGAR press conference, told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> of the devastation she witnessed in the Highland Falls/Fort Montgomery area on July 9.</p>
<p>“It was devastating to the extent that we don’t have flood insurance, we don’t have the extra money to do repairs on our houses,” she said. “We can’t even get anyone to our town to do repairs.” Waters noted that at the time all roads leading to Highland Falls were closed due to flood damage. Since then, the community is no longer cut off and is accessible.</p>
<div id="attachment_45460" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45460" class="wp-image-45460" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Judy-Gladd.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-45460" class="wp-caption-text">From left, HGAR’s Jessica Mandakas. resident Judy Gladd and Realtor Deborah Waters with Howard Hanna|Rand Realty.</p></div>
<p>She said some homes look habitable at first glance, but in fact their foundations have been heavily damaged or washed away entirely. Waters said that some Highland Falls residents were living in homes that will most likely be condemned because they had no other place to go.</p>
<p>Waters, a member of the HGAR’s Relief Assistance Team, said, “This is, so far, the only organization that is actually giving them (affected homeowners and renters) money.”</p>
<p>HGAR officials explained that residents in the affected areas who sustained flood damage may apply for one of the following options:</p>
<p>• Monthly mortgage expense for the primary residence that was affected.</p>
<p>• Rental cost due to displacement from the primary residence.</p>
<p>• Hotel reimbursement due to displacement from primary residence.</p>
<p>Financial assistance is awarded for housing only. Second mortgages, home equity loans, clothing, appliances, equipment or vehicle purchase, rental or repair are not eligible under this program.</p>
<p>All applicants will be required to submit photo IDs to show proof of residency, such as a driver’s license or other documentation, as well as a copy of the mortgage statement, lease agreement or hotel receipt. In addition, photos of damages, insurance estimates, claim status reports or copies of repair estimates must also be submitted as proof of damage to the primary residence.</p>
<p>For more information on how to apply for these grants, please visit<a href="http://www.hgar.com/realtors-relief-foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> www.hgar.com/realtors-relief-foundation</strong></a>. (application submission deadline is October 15, 2023)</p>
<p>NAR’s Realtor Relief Foundation dates back to 2001 following the September 11 terrorist attacks. NAR’s Executive Leadership team launched the program to secure contributions to help those who were impacted. Since that time, they have been providing housing assistance relief to victims of natural disasters throughout the nation. The foundation has awarded more than $40 million in total, funding 100 disaster recoveries in 43 states, and helping more than 20,000 families.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County’s Local Development Corporation voted on Aug. 23 final approval of $195-million in tax-exempt bond financing for the development of a new 162,626-square-foot Patient Care Tower on the campus of Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.</p>
<p>The $221.3-million Patient Care Tower project will feature a five-story, 128-bed structure with all of its inpatient rooms ICU-equipped and a patient-centric design with leading edge amenities that WMCHealth officials state will create a soothing, healing environment. It will house vital services for WMCHealth patients and their families including trauma, neurosciences, cardiology and general surgery.</p>
<p>“The LDC has a clear vision for the future of Westchester County, and we’re happy that vision includes projects such as the Patient Care Tower,” said Michael D. Israel, President and Chief Executive Officer, Westchester Medical Center Health Network (WMCHealth). “The Patient Care Tower on the Westchester Medical Center campus will be the Hudson Valley’s hub of critical care medicine as it will bring together critical care and medical-surgical specialties in one location, enabling Westchester Medical Center to convert to all private inpatient rooms across the rest of the campus. Additionally, the Patient Care Tower will advance our academic mission by giving medical residents and students a state-of-the-art facility in which to train.”</p>
<p>According to a cost benefit analysis prepared for the LDC, the project will provide Westchester County with total benefits of $3,531,780 over 30 years. The total benefits are comprised of $722,468 in sales tax revenue from construction; $2,528,062 of sales tax revenue from operations over 30 years, and $281,250 in fees to be collected by the LDC based on the bond proceeds. The project is also estimated to create more than 770 construction jobs and 127 new full-time jobs. WMC Health officials stated that site work has begun and that a groundbreaking will be held before year&#8217;s end. The project is expected to take two years to complete.</p>
<p>“Today’s historic approval by the Local Development Corporation is yet another example of how we are working with our not-for-profit community in securing tax-exempt bond financing benefits that are provided at no cost or risk to the taxpayers of Westchester County. This magnificent new project will further enhance our county’s world-class healthcare sector while providing a boost to our region’s economy,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.</p>
<p>“The Local Development Corporation is very pleased to approve the bond financing for this very important healthcare development at the Westchester Medical Center campus. As a result, nearly 900 construction jobs and new full-time jobs will be created and the county will receive more than $3.5 million in total economic benefits,” said Local Development Corporation Chair Joan McDonald.</p>
<p>The Local Development Corporation assists Westchester not-for-profit organizations in securing tax-exempt bond financing benefits. These benefits are provided at no cost or risk to the taxpayers of Westchester County. Since its inception in 2012, LDC has assisted not-for-profit organizations in securing tax-exempt bond financing totaling more than $500 million.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The allegations and subsequent fallout are a black-eye to an organization that has prided itself in embracing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion principles as well as fostering a safe workplace environment.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CHICAGO—Two days after a<em> New York Times</em> report that detailed claims of sexual harassment against National Association of Realtors President Kenny Parcell, the Utah-based Realtor executive, while denying the allegations, resigned from the post on Monday (Aug. 28) effective immediately. President-Elect Tracy Kasper took over as NAR President effective immediately.</p>
<p>The allegations and subsequent fallout are a black-eye to an organization that has prided itself in embracing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion principles as well as fostering a safe workplace environment. In fact, earlier this month NAR’s <em>Realtor Magazine</em> published an article entitled “NAR Prioritizes a Respectful Workplace.” NAR CEO Bob Goldberg said that the National Association of Realtors has a strong focus on respect that is a longstanding commitment that starts with training for staff and volunteer leaders. The article stated, “As sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace reaches a new level of consciousness in society, the National Association of Realtors says it is committed to providing a productive and welcoming environment for its 350 full-time staff members. This means making clear that discrimination, harassment and retaliation will never be tolerated by the association, including within employee workspaces and at NAR-sanctioned events,” says CEO Goldberg. “And it means doing everything possible to create and maintain a culture that pays proper respect to the immense amount of trust placed in the association.”</p>
<p>“NAR consistently strives to improve our workplace for every employee, and we have a robust set of policies, protocols and training programs in place to help us maintain a positive, respectful working environment,” Goldberg said. “We pride ourselves on following the best governance practices in place throughout our nation, and we remain focused on fostering a culture that encourages our people to be heard and come forward if needed.” NAR’s annual employee anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training supports those principles, the Realtor Magazine article stated.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> reported on Saturday, Aug. 26 allegations by multiple women who said they had been harassed or subjected to inappropriate conduct by NAR President Parcell. The harassment claims were based on interviews, a lawsuit that was eventually settled and an internal report. Parcell, 50, denied the accusations in written responses to <em>The New York Times</em> and in his resignation letter on Monday.</p>
<p>Multiple media outlets reported that a number of high-profile Realtors called for Parcell’s resignation in response to the <em>New York Times</em> report.</p>
<p>“I was very disturbed to read the New York Times report on the brazen attitudes and alleged behaviors of leaders at the National Association of Realtors,” says Sue Yannaccone, president and CEO of Anywhere Brands and Anywhere Advisors, according to a <em>RISMedia</em> report. “Given our predominantly female industry, I am incredibly disappointed by the reporter’s findings as NAR is supposed to be a guidepost for our industry.”</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> reported that Jason Haber, a real estate agent with Compass, started a Change.org petition over the weekend that demanded Parcell resign as NAR President.</p>
<p>Parcell’s resignation letter stated:</p>
<p><em>Executive Committee and Board of Directors,</em></p>
<p><em> This letter serves as my resignation as President of the National Association of Realtors. Being elected to this position has been a highlight in my career.</em></p>
<p><em> My resignation comes after a series of accusations against me that are categorically false. I am deeply troubled by those looking to tarnish my character and mischaracterize my well-intended actions.</em></p>
<p><em> During this experience, I’ve opened myself to listening and looking for ways to improve myself, but all I can do is tell the truth.  I’ve been shocked by these false accusations, hurtful words, whispers, and character assassination.</em></p>
<p><em> Putting the organization and the Brand first comes with the title of President. Leadership is about making tough choices; this resignation signifies that I will put the organization’s needs first to move forward above my own personal needs to stay in this position.  I truly appreciate the support and true friendships that I have made during my volunteering at NAR.</em></p>
<p><em> Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em> Kenny Parcell</em></p>
<p>Parcell was installed as 2023 President of the National Association of Realtors during NAR NXT, The Realtor Experience, on Nov. 14 in Orlando, FL. Parcell, a Realtor from Spanish Fork, UT is the Broker-Owner of Equity Real Estate Utah. He served as NAR’s vice president of government affairs in 2018 and was the Realtor Party RPAC fundraising liaison in 2017. Parcell was NAR’s Region 11 regional vice president in 2016 and served as his local association’s president in 2008 before becoming president of the Utah Association of Realtors in 2011.</p>

<p>Kasper issued a statement as she took office early as NAR President.</p>
<p><em>Following Kenny Parcell’s decision to resign his position as president, I will be stepping into my presidency early.</em></p>
<p><em> First, let me say, I’m incredibly sorry for what’s led us here.</em></p>
<p><em> We recognize there is lots of concern, anger and disappointment, and we want to acknowledge the people who have come forward and shared their stories and those of you who have shared your perspective over the past few days.</em></p>
<p><em> We have taken everything we have heard to heart. Our commitment to our staff and our members is unwavering, and we will continue to enhance the way we foster a welcoming, safe and respectful workplace.  We will work to ensure the relationship between staff and members acknowledges not only staff expertise and their commitment to the association in addition to the members. The Culture Presidential Advisory Group we announced is one step forward in that. Bob Goldberg and his team also will be working in parallel with staff on their own culture council. We are looking to make lasting and positive change and to do so as quickly as possible.</em></p>
<p><em> It is important to all of us at NAR that we take this moment to learn and focus on building a culture of comradery where we can do the good work we are all so passionate about. And, when an issue arises, that we all feel safe to say something. </em></p>
<p><em> This is a really hard time for our association. But I know this is an opportunity to really listen and grow together. As your president, I take the responsibility of rebuilding very seriously. Know I’m here for you, as is the entire leadership team, and we will get through this together.</em></p>
<p><em> Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em> Tracy</em></p>
<p>Kasper, a resident of Boise, ID, has 30 years of experience in real estate and has served on the NAR Board of Directors since 2016. She has served various groups, including the RPAC Implementation Group, the Future of the Realtor Party Presidential Advisory Group (PAG), and the RPAC State Fundraising Partnership Goal PAG. She has been a member of the Idaho Association of Realtors since 1997. She was honored to serve as its president in 2016 and was awarded Realtor of the Year that same year.</p>
<p><em>Realtor Magazine</em> reported yesterday that NAR is forming a new presidential advisory group that will look at recommendations for ensuring a healthy relationship between staff and members. There will be a parallel effort at the staff level. “We are looking to make lasting and positive change and to do so as quickly as possible,” Kasper said.</p>
<p>On a call Monday, NAR CEO Goldberg apologized to the organization’s 350 full-time staff. “We are committed to taking real action toward rebuilding trust with staff and addressing the concerns we heard,” he said in a staff memo following the meeting. “We want to expressly acknowledge and express gratitude to you for coming forward to share your experiences. As an organization, we will seek to demonstrate the same courage you have all expressed.”</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors in response to the Parcell resignation, issued an e-mail on Aug. 29 to its entire staff emphasizing its steadfast commitment to fostering a “safe and welcoming work environment.” The e-mail, co-authored by HGAR President Tony D’Anzica and Interim CEO and COO Jana Currier, stated:</p>
<p><em>“In light of the recent resignation of Kenny Parcell as President of the National Association of Realtors, and the allegations that led to his resignation, HGAR would like to assure our staff, leadership team, members and volunteers, that we stand united against any form of harassment.</em></p>
<p><em>HGAR prioritizes a safe and welcoming work environment. At the staff level, HGAR requires annual sexual harassment and anti-discrimination training for all employees. Additionally, all HGAR Directors and Officers must agree, in writing, to comply with numerous anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, including our Sexual Harassment Policy, as a precondition for serving as a Director.</em></p>
<p><em>HGAR remains steadfastly dedicated to fostering a welcoming, safe, and respectful workplace free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. HGAR will continue to prioritize transparency, education, and the implementation of policies that deter and detect unlawful or inappropriate behavior so that every employee, member, and volunteer feels valued, heard, and empowered.”</em></p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The developers of the long-anticipated movie/television studio project at Pier 94 on Manhattan’s West Side say that construction is expected to begin this fall on the $350-million, public-private partnership venture.</p>
<p>On Aug. 29, Vornado Realty Trust, Hudson Pacific Properties, Blackstone, the City of New York, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation announced they had entered into Manhattan’s first public-private partnership venture to build a purpose-built studio campus at Pier 94. The project to be built will be called “Sunset Pier 94 Studios.”</p>
<p>Vornado, who contributed its long-term leasehold with New York City for Pier 94 to the venture, will own 49.9%; Hudson Pacific will own 25.6%; and Blackstone’s institutional Core+ Real Estate strategy will own 24.5%. Vornado will be responsible for development and Hudson Pacific will provide design oversight and manage the facility’s leasing and operations.</p>
<p>Plans for the 266,000-square-foot Sunset Pier 94 Studios include six purpose-built soundstages with production control room facilities and 145,000 square feet of production support space and offices, with Hudson River views and on-site parking. Several stages will have technological infrastructure for adaptation to virtual production. The facility’s location, design, size and technological capabilities will provide world-class convenience and flexibility for episodic television, live audience television and feature films, the partnership stated. In alignment with the broader Sunset Studios portfolio, Sunset Pier 94 Studios will prioritize sustainability, targeting LEED Gold and Fitwel certification, with plans for operations to be powered by 100% renewable energy.</p>
<p>“With our administration’s leadership, New York City is back—we have recovered 99% of the jobs lost during the pandemic, and visitors from across the world are returning to Broadway and Times Square,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “At the same time, from Willets Points in Queens to Kips Bay in Manhattan to Kingsbridge Heights in the Bronx, we are advancing bold economic development projects across the entire city that will create tens of thousands of family-sustaining jobs in our communities, and the activation of Pier 94 will produce the same kinds of economic opportunities on the West Side of Manhattan. This project will bring critical, long-awaited investment to this public asset, turn an underutilized space into an economic driver, and improve public space and quality of life for New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>“Sunset Pier 94 Studios demonstrates a monumental public-private partnership that will have a lasting impact on our city by creating 400 film and TV jobs, over 1,300 construction jobs, along with an estimated economic impact of $6.4 billion over the next 30 years,” said New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) President &amp; CEO Andrew Kimball.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Blackstone, Hudson Pacific, and the City of New York will solidify New York as a leading market for content production and studio space, create jobs, drive economic momentum, and deliver a host of amenities to the surrounding community,” said Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer at Vornado Realty Trust. “Together we’ll raise the bar for one of New York City’s signature industries and breathe new life into a key waterfront site.”</p>
<p>The new facility will be the first New York location for Hudson Pacific and Blackstone’s growing studio platform and synergistic with its existing Los Angeles operations. With the addition of Sunset Pier 94 Studios, Sunset Studios will comprise 69 existing and planned stages globally across six purpose-built facilities, all in top-tier locations within the well-established and supply constrained production epicenters of Los Angeles, London and New York. Sunset Studio’s planned Sunset Waltham Cross Studios is expected to open in 2026 with 21 sound stages. Hudson Pacific’s Quixote brand operates an additional 26 stages in Los Angeles and New Orleans and services productions in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, New Orleans and Albuquerque.</p>
<p>The project represents a total investment of approximately $350 million from Vornado, Hudson Pacific and Blackstone, and is expected to create more than 1,300 construction jobs, 400 permanent jobs and contribute $6.4 billion to the local economy over the next 30 years. Construction will begin in the third quarter of this year. RBC is providing $183 million in construction financing. The project is expected to be completed by year-end 2025.</p>
<p>The New York City Economic Development Corp. reached an agreement with Vornado Realty Trust in April 2008 to redevelop Pier 94. The original plan called for the development of a trade show facility and also included the adjacent Pier 92 site. However, the Pier 92 location is not part of the current movie studio project plan.</p>
<p>Sunset Pier 94 Studios will also include a host of public amenities, including new public restrooms for Hudson River Park, an 1,850-square-foot community amenity space, 25,000 square feet of waterfront open space and pier access, and safety improvements to the bikeway. There will also be a program to support workforce development and training programs to connect local residents to opportunities in film, television, commercial and other media production.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with the City of New York, Vornado, and Blackstone to bring this unparalleled, ideally located production experience to New York. The city has an extensive, well-established production infrastructure yet is highly supply constrained in terms of stages,” said Victor Coleman, Chairman and CEO of Hudson Pacific. “Once again we are leveraging our industry relationships and unique expertise in building and operating premier facilities for leading content creators in the highest-barrier-to-entry global media markets to create long-term value for our shareholders.”</p>
<p>“Content creation is one of our key global investment themes, and we are thrilled to be part of this one-of-a-kind, public-private partnership that delivers for our investors while aiming to create more than 1,300 construction jobs and 400 permanent jobs, and contribute $6.4 billion over the next 30 years to the local New York City economy. I want to thank the City of New York, Mayor Eric Adams, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation for helping make this project possible,” said Nadeem Meghji, Blackstone’s Head of Real Estate Americas.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors regrets to inform its membership of the tragic passing of real estate veteran, HGAR member, association executive and attorney Don Cummins III on Friday, Sept. 1 at the age of 54.</p>
<p>Cummins was previously the Team Leader at Keller Williams Realty Partners of Baldwin Place and formerly served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Columbia Greene Board of Realtors and CEO of the Columbia Greene Northern Dutchess Multiple Listing Service. A well-known and well-liked Realtor, association executive and real estate instructor, Cummins served as the CEO of the Columbia Greene Board of Realtors from June 2019 until recently.</p>
<p>Prior to those positions, Cummins was hired as in-house legal counsel at the Westchester-Putnam Association of Realtors and assisted in the merger of the Orange County Association of Realtors and the Rockland County Board of Realtors into what would become the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. He then served as HGAR’s Director of Legal Services and Professional Standards until July 2015 when he was named manager of Coldwell Banker’s Yorktown Office.</p>
<p>At HGAR, Cummins was responsible for administering the professional standards and grievance proceedings for the entire lower Hudson Valley region, as well as providing legal counsel for the association and multiple listing service system.</p>
<p>A licensed attorney, Cummins had an extensive legal and real estate background. He began his legal career as the Fellowship Law Clerk to Chief Judge Michael Mukasey, U.S. Attorney General and then went on to join one of New York City’s premiere Antitrust and Corporate Litigation law firms. Later, he opened his own legal practice in Westchester and Putnam counties and during that time he was the lead instructor and chair of the Education Committee of the former Putnam County Association of Realtors and was an instructor for the New York State Association of Realtors. His legal practice specialized in legal issues, will, trusts and estates and general litigation. He was named PCAR&#8217;s Man of the Year in 2008.</p>
<p>A Celebration of Don&#8217;s life will be held on Saturday, Sept. 9 at 22 Mayfair Lane in Mahopac from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>By now you may have seen the headlines and heard the outrage and opinions being formed regarding the National Association of Realtors and the allegations and controversy relating to sexual harassment and hostile workplace environments. I don’t work for NAR, so I will not address any of the NAR allegations, but because I work for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, I’d like to take this moment to remind our membership of their obligations as Realtors and to reinforce what we do here at the association to ensure that everyone is treated equally. I speak not just of lofty ideals, but the practical nature of them as well.</p>
<p>As a licensed attorney and the Professional Standards Administrator for HGAR, I’m required to follow various legal and professional codes of conduct and I provide guidance to others on these exact same topics. So, when a teaching moment such as the one we are currently encountering presents itself, I think it’s important that we seize this opportunity. Read this. Share this. Teach and guide others.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance From the Past</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the now defunct association of printers, Realtors were the first business group of professionals, outside of the “learned professions of medicine, engineering, and law” to adopt a Code of Ethics. It is because of this Code that Realtors have been able to succeed, grow and become the largest trade association in the United States. Our foundation is built upon the Code and our roots run deep into the land and our duty to ensure that we treat everyone equally and honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Pathways to Professionalism</strong></p>
<p><em>Pathways to Professionalism</em> is a part of the Realtor doctrine. It is a set of voluntary guidelines and professional courtesies that all Realtors should follow, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the “Golden Rule.”</li>
<li>Show courtesy and respect for everyone.</li>
<li>Show courtesy, trust, and respect to other real estate professionals.</li>
<li>Avoid the inappropriate use of endearments or other denigrating language.</li>
<li>To be successful in the business, mutual respect is essential.</li>
</ul>
<p>At its core, <em>Pathways to Professionalism </em>provides the underpinnings for the Code of Ethics. While it doesn’t explicitly address sexual harassment or a hostile work environment, it does touch on these issues and it establishes a launching off point for moral conduct and protections in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
<p>The Code starts with a preamble. This precursor to the Code establishes its framework and, while it speaks in lofty ideals, its words should be taken to heart and incorporated into our actions:</p>
<p><em>“Such interests impose obligations beyond those of ordinary commerce. They impose grave social responsibility and a patriotic duty to which Realtors should dedicate themselves.”</em></p>
<p><em>“[Realtors should] eliminate practices which may damage the public or which might discredit or bring dishonor to the real estate profession.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The term Realtor has come to connote competency, fairness, and high integrity resulting from adherence to a lofty ideal of moral conduct in business relations.”</em></p>
<p>All these excerpts shine a light on the ethical duty of Realtors to be fair, to maintain a moral compass, and to hold themselves out as the standard bearer of fairness, social justice and equality. Sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment run completely contrary to these ideals and there is no place for allowing such activities.</p>
<p><strong>The Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p>The Code sets forth various ethical requirements. Again, none of the articles directly address sexual harassment or a hostile workplace but they are touchstones for the principle that sexual harassment and hostile workplaces should not be tolerated. For example, various Articles of the Code refer to a number of worthwhile principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 1: “…treat all parties honestly.”</li>
<li>Article 2: “…avoid exaggeration, misrepresentation, or concealment….”</li>
<li>Article 10: “…shall not deny equal professional services….”</li>
<li>Article 12: “…be honest and truthful in their real estate communications….”</li>
<li>Article 15: “…shall not knowingly or recklessly make false or misleading statements about other real estate professionals….”</li>
</ul>
<p>While these articles are relating to Realtor transactions and not the workplace, each and every article could be applied to the workplace as well. Each one carries the same tone of morality, fairness and professionalism. Any Realtor applying these Codes should, consistent with the benchmarks established by the Code, apply the same principles to their workplace. There should be no room to circumvent these ideals in favor of anything less.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Policies for Employees</strong></p>
<p>At HGAR, we take sexual harassment and hostile workplace activity prevention seriously. Each employee is provided with an employee handbook. They are required to review this handbook and understand it. This handbook establishes that HGAR is a violence- and harassment-free workplace and it goes into detail on what could be deemed harassment and provides examples of inappropriate activities. These requirements/prohibitions apply not only to employee-to-employee interactions, but also to all interactions with clients, customers, guests, members, vendors and anyone doing business with HGAR. The handbook further addresses the reporting process, which is confidential, the obligation to report incidents in which an employee may encounter or observe, supervisory responsibilities, and how investigations are to be conducted and resolved. It also discusses other legal protections, including the NYS Human Rights Law, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other local protections that are also available.</p>
<p>Each employee is required to review, agree to abide by, and then sign a sexual harassment and prevention policy acknowledgment form which covers not only all forms of harassment, but also hostile workplace activities, and retaliation prohibitions. Additionally, complaint forms are provided by HGAR to all employees in an effort to break down barriers to reporting. Moreover, each HGAR employee must participate in an annual sexual harassment prevention training seminar.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Policies for Board Members</strong></p>
<p>Not only are all HGAR employees held accountable for their actions, but each and every HGAR Board of Director participates in an onboarding orientation as well. During this orientation, all Board members undergo anti-harassment training, which covers the identical principles/requirements of the employee program. This training applies to old and new Board members alike. Each Board member is required to review, understand and abide by the general anti-harassment policies, as well as the more specific anti-sexual harassment policies of HGAR. They also review and agree to the no-retaliation policy as well. Like HGAR employees, Board members are provided with an understanding of not only how to report a complaint, but their obligation to report incidents that they observe. Upon completing the orientation, they must sign an acknowledgment form. No Board member will be permitted to serve until such time as they review and agree with all the HGAR policies.</p>
<p><strong>Realtor Obligations</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the Code, where all Realtors self-police each other, the same should hold true for any sexual harassment or hostile workplace incidents. If you are a victim of such activities, you should understand that what is/has happened is wrong and should not be tolerated. You are encouraged to report it because if it goes unaddressed it could continue or increase. If you observe someone being the subject of such actions, you should report it. We all must work together to eradicate actions that are wholly unacceptable and hold those that violate policies and the law accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Time to Step Up</strong></p>
<p>Sexual harassment and hostile working conditions should never be acceptable. As a local association, we have taken steps to irradicate what was once considered permissible. NAR has taken steps to create a Presidential Advisory Group (PAG) focused on NAR&#8217;s culture to determine what more NAR can be doing. So now I ask, “What are you doing?” I encourage all of you to join together to do your part as well. I encourage all brokerages to adopt anti-harassment policies and procedures, not only for your employees, but also for your agents/independent contractors. I ask that each of you do your part to eliminate bad “habits,” identify improper conduct, and call out those that fail to embrace the high standards, ideals and moral conduct that is required of all Realtors.</p>
<p>Realtors are special. We are leaders. We are socially progressive. We are innovators. We care. Do not sit complacently by assuming that others will step up for you. It’s time for you to step up.</p>
<p>As General Counsel and Professional Standards Administrator for HGAR, I am here to answer any questions and assist you however I can.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress released a new report on Sept. 12 that clearly identifies an affordability crisis for housing in the region, fueled by stagnant wages, increasing rents, and skyrocketing home prices that have stretched household budgets to their limits.</p>
<p>The report, Out of Reach Hudson Valley 2023, uses federal and local data to examine the gap between wages and the cost of rental housing for those living in the nine-county region. Pattern also examined the affordability of homeownership throughout the Hudson Valley by comparing median home prices to the mortgages for which typical families would qualify in each county.</p>
<p>The data show a persistent and clear trend across the entire Hudson Valley: the cost of housing has pushed beyond reasonable levels of affordability for most of our neighbors. A single worker cannot afford fair-market rent for a one-bedroom apartment in any of the nine counties, and median home prices are more than $100,000 higher than the mortgage that typical families would qualify for in every county, Pattern officials stated.</p>
<p>“The data we analyze each year tell a clear and troubling story: most of our neighbors cannot afford to live in the communities where they work,” Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress CEO Adam Bosch said. “As our neighbors choose to leave the region, have smaller families, and our workforce slowly shrinks, the Hudson Valley is starting to feel some of the most painful ramifications of stagnant housing and zoning policies. Civic leaders at every level must rally around evidence-based solutions to solve our regional crisis of housing affordability and availability. The vibrancy and viability of our communities will depend on actions that encourage the production of more housing at prices our working-class neighbors can afford.”</p>
<p>The Pattern report utilized county-by-county data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which examined hourly wages and fair-market rents to measure the affordability of rental housing. (Fair-market rent is the 40th percentile of renters who have moved within the past two years, which means it is lower than median market-rate rents.) Affordability is calculated by the standard that no individual or family should spend more than 30% of its total monthly income on housing. Pattern also used that standard to measure the affordability of homeownership in the Hudson Valley. Pattern calculated the mortgage for which households earning the area median income would qualify and compared that to the median price of homes in each county. Pattern examined these data for the nine-county region, including Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester counties.</p>
<p>Some key conclusions from the report included:</p>
<p>• Single adults working 40 hours per week on average renter wages cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in any of the nine counties. Renters would need to earn anywhere from $1 to $26 more per hour to afford rent in their respective counties. Renters in every county are considered “cost burdened.”</p>
<p>• Fair-market rents would need to decline anywhere from $33 to $1,343 per month to make them affordable for a person earning average renter wages across the region.</p>
<p>• Families are also stretched thin. Two working adults in a two-bedroom apartment can afford rent in seven of the nine counties. Fair-market rents remain unaffordable in Putnam and Rockland. However, two working renters meet the affordability standard by less than $100 per month in Orange and Ulster counties, which leaves little money left over for other expenditures or emergencies.</p>
<p>• Wages earned by a typical renter ranged from 39%-61%  of the area median income, a key metric for housing policies and programs.</p>
<p>• Since 2010, renters have comprised a larger proportion of all households in the Hudson Valley. From 2010-2021, the region saw an 8% increase in renter-occupied households and a 2 percent increase in owner-occupied households. The growth in renter-occupied households outpaced owner households by 2-to-1.</p>
<p>• The median price of a home in the Hudson Valley exceeds mortgage qualifications for the typical household by more than $100,000 in all nine counties. For a two-person household, the gap is anywhere from $109,609 in Putnam County to $280,699 in Westchester County. Data indicate that more middle-income households are staying in rentals as the cost of homeownership gets further out of reach for a greater proportion of them.</p>
<p>• An analysis of income data found that low-, moderate-, and middle-income earners saw their spending power stagnate or decline from 2010-2021. The trend for the bottom two-fifths of earners, which generally include people making up to $50,000 per year, are of special concern. These workers have seen their wages flatten or decline relative to inflation, exacerbating their financial stress for housing and other necessary expenses. For earners in the lowest two quintiles, the Hudson Valley has seen wage growth that significantly underperformed statewide and national trends.</p>
<p>The data from the report indicate that renters and homeowners in the Hudson Valley have little to spend on necessary and discretionary expenses because the cost of housing is gobbling up a large proportion of their incomes. Many service workers, for example, are living month-to-month with little money left over for savings or emergencies. This has broader implications for the Hudson Valley. For example, migration data from the Internal Revenue Service show that more people have moved out of the Hudson Valley than into it for 24 of the last 25 years— a trend that has resulted in a net loss of 134,505 people since 1996. State education data show there are 34,088 fewer children in our schools than in 1996, Pattern officials stated. These deleterious trends are connected to, and partially caused by, the relatively high cost of housing in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>The Out of Reach report can be accessed at: <a href="https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/out-of-reach-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/out-of-reach-2023/</a></p>
<p>As a result, the region is now struggling through the early stages of a workforce crisis. Data show that our workforce shortages will also worsen in the next two decades unless the region can see a shift in well-established population trends. Currently, the older half of the labor pool (45-64) outnumbers the younger half (ages 25-44) by approximately 100,000 people. As the Baby Boomer generation continues to retire in larger numbers, the cohorts of workers coming into the Hudson Valley labor pool are only a fraction of their size. Consequentially, almost every industry sector in the nine-county region is struggling to find enough workers to meet their needs for labor. Pattern explained this trend—and its connection to housing in a report released this past May entitled The Great People Shortage and its Effects on the Hudson Valley region. A copy of the report can be accessed at: <a href="https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/the-great-people-shortage-a-special-report-analyzing-hudson-valley-demographic-trends-and-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/the-great-people-shortage-a-special-report-analyzing-hudson-valley-demographic-trends-and-consequences/</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In its recently released “Out of Reach report, Pattern stated: “Wage stagnation in our lower income brackets paired with skyrocketing housing and living costs have created an affordability crisis with devastating consequences for our hardworking neighbors and our entire region.” Earlier this year, Pattern released &#8220;The Great People Shortage and its Effects on the Hudson Valley,&#8221; which found that the Hudson Valley region lost a net of more than 130,000 people to migration since 1996. A national survey by the U.S. Census Bureau found the top reasons cited for leaving New York State were housing-related: more affordable and higher quality housing, or the opportunity to buy a home elsewhere.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pattern stated that its “Out of Reach” report’s findings were troubling. “The solutions to our affordability crisis are not simple, and they cannot focus on one corner of our civic structure alone. State and federal governments must work to ensure that our hardworking neighbors are compensated fairly. To meet the demand for housing, state and local governments must adopt significant changes to land-use and housing policies that support the kind of development that is affordable for our residents. These efforts must include deeply affordable rentals as well as new opportunities for homeownership; many tenants are paying more in rent than they would on monthly mortgage payments, but traditional pathways to homeownership are unviable due to prices that have far outpaced incomes.”</p>
<p>Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress is a nonprofit organization that provides objective research, planning, and educational training throughout the region. Its work identifies civic challenges and promotes regional, equitable, and sustainable solutions to constantly improve the quality of life in Hudson Valley communities. Pattern develops its work upon a considerable foundation of facts and experience, without political aims or affiliations. Pattern was founded in 1965 by the region’s academic, business, and nonprofit leaders.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CHICAGO—In a video message posted on Sept. 7, National Association of Realtors President Tracy Kasper acknowledged the pain caused by the charges of harassment and discrimination at NAR that led to the resignation of former NAR President Kenny Parcell on Aug. 28.</p>
<p>Kasper, who was named NAR President on Aug. 28, acknowledged that in the aftermath of the scandal that members and staff “are hurting right now. Their trust has been broken. It is upsetting to hear that some members and staff have not felt safe or respected and I want you to know that I hear you, the Leadership Team and the Executive Committee hears you. We must figure out what NAR needs to do to make sure that every member and every association staff person always feels respected and valued.”</p>
<p>In her video message, Kasper detailed a number of initiatives NAR has already undertaken to investigate how instances of discrimination and harassment were reported and addressed and how the association can make improvements to its operations, including better screening of volunteer association Board members. “I can promise you going forward, we will do and be better,” she said.</p>
<p>She related that NAR plans to hire outside experts to assess the process in which harassment reports are investigated and the outcomes of those probes. “We expect that there will be recommendations to implement new and better safeguards and procedures,” she related.</p>
<p>She also reported that NAR plans to take a hard look at how its leaders are selected, the power and control they now have and how they interact with the association’s staff of professionals.</p>
<p>Kasper said that one of the questions being asked by members in the aftermath of the Parcell resignation is even if the alleged behavior was not illegal, why wasn’t more done to stop it? She related that in the past year NAR has implemented a number of policies to address the conduct and behavior of volunteer leaders.</p>
<p>“But what we are seeing and experiencing show us is that those new policies and practices still are not enough,” Kasper said in the video message. “There is so much work that needs to be done.”</p>
<p>NAR is also in the process of assembling a “Culture PAG” (President’s Advisory Group) that will include contributions from NAR members, state and local association executives, as well as NAR staff members.</p>
<p>Kasper also revealed that NAR has retained Dr. Shaun Harper, a DEI expert, to guide the Culture PAG toward recommendations.</p>
<p>While stressing that NAR has taken quick actions to address the issues raised in days following the Parcell harassment claims and resignation, she noted, “We also want to get this right. We have to listen better, we have to take meaningful action, we have to do better by our members and our staff,” she said.</p>
<p>She concluded her remarks with a hopeful plea for unity. “Please, know that as hard as this moment is, I still very much have faith in this organization. There are so many people who care. So many people who want to do the right thing. You have the unwavering commitment of the Executive Committee, the leadership team and me to get this right.,” Kasper said. “Because no one should feel anything less than heard, empowered and able to do their work in an environment they feel safe and respected. And I need each and every member beside us on this, each and every member treating each other and every member of staff with dignity and respect.”</p>
<p>Kasper (AHWD, C2EX, CIPS, CRS, GRI, SFR), is a Realtor from Nampa, ID and the Broker-Owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Silverhawk Realty in the Boise Valley and a majority owner in two other Idaho real estate companies. With 30 years of experience in real estate, she still lists and sells both residential and commercial real estate in addition to her Broker-Owner duties.</p>
<p>At the national level, Kasper has served on the NAR Board of Directors since 2016 and has chaired the 50th Anniversary of the RPAC Implementation Group in 2018. She was a member of the Future of the REALTOR Party Presidential Advisory Group (PAG) in 2017 and the RPAC State Fundraising Partnership Goal PAG in 2016.</p>
<p>She has been a dedicated member of the Idaho Association of Realtors since 1997. She served as its president in 2016 and was selected as Realtor of the Year that same year. At the local level, Kasper belongs to five local Idaho associations. She is a past president of the Nampa Association of Realtors and is a past Realtor of the Year for both the Nampa (2001) and Caldwell (2011) boards.</p>
<p>She has served for many years on her local chamber, was Chairman of the Board for the Caldwell Chamber of Commerce in 2009 and is a former Honorary Commander for the Idaho Air National Guard in Boise. Kasper and her husband, Mike, have seven grown children, four of whom are married. Between them, they have six grandchildren. In her spare time, she has helped to raise more than $500,000 for a variety of youth charities in the Boise Valley.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It is disheartening, but this column yet again has to address the very real threats that cyber-attacks and ransomware incidents pose to industries, including the real estate industry, and individuals. Recently there has been a wave of serious cyber and ransomware attacks against well-known companies, such as Rapattoni, one of the largest national companies providing hosting services to more than 100 multiple listing services (MLSs), as well as hotels and casinos, notably Caesars and the MGM Grand in Las Vegas [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3LoiFTO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3LoiFTO</a>].</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, it was also reported that another individual in New York City lost $746,000 in connection with a real estate purchase when she was “duped” into wiring funds to a cybercriminal who hacked into her attorney’s e-mail account. When these attacks occur, the FBI and local law enforcement usually become involved immediately. These attacks result in billions of dollars of losses each year. In connection with ransomware attacks, companies are often forced to pay these criminals substantial amounts in ransom in order to regain access to their systems. On the other hand, when individuals are targeted, many times these individuals lose their entire life savings.</p>
<p><strong>The Attack on Rapattoni</strong></p>
<p>On Aug. 8, Rapattoni suffered a cyber-attack which sent shockwaves throughout the real estate industry. While the extent or economic effects of the attack may not be known precisely, many MLSs throughout the country, including the real estate agents and brokerage firms who rely on them, were severely affected and the economic costs will certainly be extensive.</p>
<p>As reported by journalist Mathew J. Schwartz [see <a href="https://bit.ly/44NIbss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/44NIbss</a>] “Real estate agents’ ability to list or update property information has been compromised by an attack on…Rapattoni….” Schwartz explained that “Multiple regional MLS providers rely on Rapattoni’s services to identify new properties coming on the market, update home listings, and bring together buyers and sellers to facilitate offers and track purchase details, as well as track commissions for listing agents and the agent who secures a sale.” Agents and brokers had to resort to manual processes to update and share listings. It has been reported that the attack on Rapattoni was the “longest-running attack on an MLS.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3LqwRvw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3LqwRvw</a>].</p>
<p>Alicia Hope of <em>CPO Magazine</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3t0mrfy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3t0mrfy</a>], reported, “With the cost of a data breach estimated at $4.35 million, cyber-attacks pose an existential threat to most businesses.” She further noted that “the incident shows that cybercriminals are targeting the real estate industry for the vast amount of personal and financial information (including of wealthy individuals) it holds and the cost of disruption or data loss.” She also pointed out that real estate transactions are “lucrative targets for business e-mail compromise and wire fraud.”</p>
<p><strong>The Real Estate Transaction: Wire Fraud is Very Real</strong></p>
<p>On Aug. 26<sup>th</sup>, Kathianne Boniello of the <em>New York Post</em> reported that an individual in New York City, Leila Meltzer, the victim of a business e-mail compromise (BEC) attack, “lost the bulk of her savings after thieves hacked into her real estate lawyer’s e-mail and duped her into wiring them more than $746,000.” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Zkco19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Zkco19</a>]. Meltzer, a retired nurse, was in contract to purchase an apartment. She received an e-mail which she thought was from her own attorney. Hackers had accessed her attorney’s e-mail account and instructed Meltzer to wire the balance owed on the transaction to an account controlled by the hackers. Meltzer did not discover that she had been the victim of fraud until two days later, but the funds had already been withdrawn and could not be recovered.</p>
<p>Meltzer reported the incident to the FBI and the NYPD. She also filed a lawsuit against her attorney “alleging the attorney was ‘oblivious to the threat of cybercrime’ and ‘failed to take even the most rudimentary steps to protect Meltzer from cyberfraud.’” Unfortunately, these cyberattacks are all too common, but it is critical that clients are informed about wire fraud and cybersecurity issues.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Important Steps to Notify Clients of Cyber Threats</strong></p>
<p>It is important to discuss the risks associated with cyber threats, wire fraud, BEC attacks, privacy issues, etc. at the very initial stages of representation. It is also recommended that these issues are detailed in writing and provided to the client so that the client is made aware of what to do in instances such as this. Below is language that should be utilized and included on all e-mails sent by attorneys and other professionals:</p>
<p><em>WARNING: FRAUD ALERT &#8211; BEWARE OF CYBER-FRAUD – If you receive an email from this office requesting that you wire or otherwise transfer funds, you must confirm the request and any corresponding instructions via telephone before you initiate any transfer. Hackers are targeting emails of attorneys, real estate brokers and other businesses in attempts to initiate fraudulent wire requests. YOU MUST CONFIRM THE TELEPHONE NUMBER OF THIS OFFICE WITH PREVIOUS EMAILS AND CORRESPONDENCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM THIS OFFICE AND MUST CALL OUR OFFICE IN PERSON TO BE SURE IT IS ACCURATE.</em></p>
<p>It is also recommended that language be included in engagement letters, retainer agreements or in disclosures that are signed and acknowledged by the clients. Some of the points that should be covered may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight that there are high incidents of e-mail fraud and cyber security threats involving hacking and theft of personally identifiable information (e.g., Social Security numbers, bank account numbers and routing information).</li>
<li>Alert clients that hackers may gain access to your e-mail and/or e-mail system and send false e-mails requesting that funds or other sensitive information be sent to them (posing as you or someone else) via e-mail.</li>
<li>Inform clients never to do anything without directly speaking with someone at your office.</li>
<li>Alert clients that you will never send them any e-mails requesting such information without also calling the client directly and confirming such a request personally by telephone after any such e-mail has been sent.</li>
<li>Most importantly, alert clients NOT to wire any funds to any person or entity without first calling your office to confirm the same and to confirm the bank account and routing information.</li>
<li>Alert clients that they are to contact the office directly and not through e-mail to confirm whether any instructions received are legitimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted above, the real estate industry is specifically targeted by these cybercriminals due to the frequent use of wire transfers. Real estate agents and real estate attorneys are particularly vulnerable because the e-mails exchanged between these parties and their clients contain critical information as to when a closing will occur, the amounts that will need to be wired and the location to which the wire transfers are to be made. A cybercriminal will try to gain access to a party’s e-mail account, and once this is accomplished, the criminal will wait for the opportune moment to strike.</p>
<p><strong>2022 FBI IC3 Report on Cyber Crimes</strong></p>
<p>Each year the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) issues an in-depth annual report on the state of cyber-criminal activity in the United States and the risks posed by such activity. The FBI’s 2022 IC3 Report [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Rlt4TS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Rlt4TS</a>] states, “Today’s cyber landscape has provided ample opportunities for criminals and adversaries to target U.S. networks, attack our critical infrastructure, hold our money and data for ransom, facilitate large-scale fraud schemes, and threaten our national security.” While the 2022 IC3 Report indicates that there was a 5% decrease in reported incidents as compared to 2021, the “potential loss has grown from $6.9 billion in 2021 to more than $10.2 billion in 2022.” These totals are certain to increase in 2023. From 2018 to 2022, IC3 received 3.26 million complaints and losses during that time were $27.6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>IC3 Areas of Concern</strong></p>
<p>According to the 2022 IC3 report, the top five cybercrimes involved extortion, phishing, personal data breach, non-payment/non-delivery, and tech support. Incidents of extortion crimes rose significantly in 2022, with 76,741 reported incidents as compared to 39,260 in 2021. This number is expected to increase dramatically in 2023. The 2022 IC3 report also highlighted three areas of concern: Business E-mail Compromise (BEC), Investment and Ransomware.</p>
<p><strong>Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) Threats</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, IC3 received 21,832 complaints relating to BEC scams and losses totaled more than $2.7 billion. According to the IC3, BEC is a “sophisticated scam targeting both businesses and individuals performing transfers of funds. The scam is frequently carried out when a subject compromises legitimate business e-mail accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.” BEC scams commonly target individuals involved in real estate closings. The IC3 Recovery Asset Team (RAT), which assists with all aspects of cybercrimes, offers the following specific guidance to those victims of BEC crimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact the originating financial institution as soon as fraud is recognized to request a recall or reversal and a Hold Harmless Letter or Letter of Indemnity.</li>
<li>File a detailed complaint with <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ic3.gov</a>. It is vital the complaint contain all required data in provided fields, including banking information.</li>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ic3.gov</a> for updated PSAs regarding BEC trends as well as other fraud schemes targeting specific populations, like trends targeting real estate, pre-paid cards, and W-2s, for example.</li>
<li>Never make any payment changes without verifying the change with the intended recipient; verify e-mail addresses are accurate when checking e-mail on a cell phone or other mobile device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ransomware Crimes</strong></p>
<p>The IC3 report explains that “Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that encrypts data on a computer, making it unusable. In addition to encrypting the network, the cyber-criminal will often steal data off the system and hold that data hostage until the ransom is paid. If the ransom is not paid, the victim’s data remains unavailable.” The IC3 notes, “Phishing e-mails, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top initial infection vectors for ransomware incidents reported to the IC3.” In 2022, the IC3 received 2,385 ransomware complaints and 39,416 extortion complaints, which amounted to losses exceeding $34.3 million and $54.3 million, respectively. However, the figures contained in the IC3 report may be well below the actual amounts.</p>
<p>According to a report by Chainalysis [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3LqPjnB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3LqPjnB</a>], ransomware crimes are significantly on the rise in 2023, and “Ransomware attackers are on pace for their second-biggest year ever, having extorted at least $449.1 million through June.” In all of 2022, the figure relating to ransomware attacks was just under $500 million. Chainalysis projects that ransomware attacks will extort close to $900 million if the pace continues, which will be second only to 2021, where the figure totaled nearly $940 million—and, with the recent attacks, the pace does not seem to be slowing.</p>
<p>As we can see from the recent attacks on the Las Vegas casinos that occurred this week and the attack on Rapattoni, the economic effects can be devasting. The IC3 report points out that the “FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.” Although not recommended or ideal, in many cases a ransom is paid in order to regain access.</p>
<p><strong>The IC3 Recovery Asset Team</strong></p>
<p>The FBI strongly recommends that all incidents of cyberattacks should be reported to IC3 so that investigators can assess the attack and obtain critical information which could potentially allow them to track these criminals, hold them accountable, and possibly prevent future attacks. Once these incidents are reported to IC3, the Internet Crime Complaint Center’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT), which was established in 2018, communicates with financial institutions and “assists FBI field offices with the freezing of funds for victims who made transfers to domestic accounts under fraudulent pretenses.” Unfortunately, once the funds are wired to the cybercriminal’s account, it may be difficult or impossible to claw back the funds. However, if the FBI and the banking institution are notified within 24 to 48 hours from the time the funds were wired, the funds may be recoverable. The RAT Team serves as the “liaison” between law enforcement and financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Threats Are Real, Do Not Take Them Lightly!</strong></p>
<p>It is not a question of whether you will be the victim of a cyberattack, but when. The potential for a cyberattack should never be taken lightly. Cyberattacks are very real and all individuals and businesses need to be aware of the dangers and risks. Individuals and companies must take these threats seriously and put in place protections to reduce the risk, although it is impossible to totally eliminate it.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks are very costly. Companies and individuals are also required to spend thousands more to comply with the data breach and notification requirements of state and local laws. It is important for all businesses to look into obtaining cybersecurity insurance coverage as most insurance policies do not cover cyberattacks or the related damages and costs incurred. Appropriate cybersecurity coverage will not only cover the damages incurred, but will also provide coverage for the costs involved to send the required notices under the law, which can be very expensive. Once an attack occurs it is too late. Taking the appropriate measures in advance will go a long way in affording the necessary protections should one occur.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>The “zombies” of issues left to be decided are poised to walk the halls again this coming legislative year. With the added specter of a Presidential election year, the 2024 New York State Legislative Session will play out while some State Representatives fight in primary elections, providing a backdrop for a legislative session where there is expected to be, just like in 2023, a fight over the budget, Good Cause Eviction and, of course, the housing crisis.</p>
<p>What will inevitably break into fights over forced density increase, transit-oriented development and the affordability issue, the Housing Crisis will play itself out to no end, much to the chagrin of housing advocates, first-time homebuyers and those who make their living providing homes for people. What will definitely go under the radar is a probable cause and possible solution for the log jam that is housing policy in this state.</p>
<p>What you may know is that each municipality in New York State has almost complete control over its zoning and land use. This power of local government is called “home rule.” The power of home rule is, surprisingly, not limited to Mayors and Town Councils, but also extends to the Zoning and Planning Board of each municipality. The boards tasked with reviewing applications are typically composed of community volunteers who have some level of interest or expertise on the issues of land use.</p>
<p>These boards may approve an application, approve it subject to conditions, deny it outright, or hold it over to subsequent meetings after asking for additional information, additional study, suggested revisions, or to accommodate further public comment. The more complex the project, the more likely it will need to repeat this process through multiple boards. It is land use boards where housing goes to die. Most zoning boards in New York State over the past 40 years have opted to deny or delay indefinitely multi-family projects or housing options that were not single-family homes.</p>
<p>These denials or delays by Land Use boards can be prompted by several reasons, including a concern about community character, a fear of increased traffic, or an outright dislike of increasing density. Regardless of their individual reason, the institutional reason that land use boards have not allowed an increase in housing stock over the last few decades is because of a distinct lack of education.</p>
<p>What is not common knowledge is just how little education and oversight it takes to be a member of a volunteer land use board. As of now in New York State, the law requires that each member of the volunteer zoning and planning boards go through four hours of training a year. What that training consists of or oversight on if this training is ever completed is not a requirement of the law. To put this in perspective, New York State has 1,187 cities, towns and villages and each municipality has at least five zoning board members, which means there are more than 5,000 individuals with unknown education levels dictating housing policies. This has been the case for decades.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that the volunteers on these boards are good people—civic-minded individuals that believe in what’s best for their community. I also know it to be true that New York State has record housing costs, a declining housing stock, and rising segregation. It is why I believe that through better accountability and education, these individuals can make better land use decisions on a local level that will truly bring what is best for communities and their downtowns.</p>
<p>Modern literature and studies on the topic of housing and economics have indicated an increase in housing is an almost universal gain for local economies. Recent studies from Long Island and Westchester County have dispelled myths that an increase in housing hurts local school districts, and, in fact, local studies have shown that an increase in housing is a net positive for school districts.</p>
<p>From the Presidential to State Legislative election contests, 2024 will be a robust political year, and the politics around housing will be thick. When we inevitably find our leaders talking about rent for life or the dangers/benefits of ADU, remember and advocate for a common-sense solution—better education for Land Use Boards.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CENTRAL VALLEY—Experts that contend brick and mortar retail is dead, apparently have not heard of Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Orange County.</p>
<p>Owner Simon Property Group announced today it has officially presented plans for another expansion of the property located at the intersection of I-87 and Route 17. The latest expansion plan is valued at $250 million and, if approved, will feature:</p>
<p>• 155,000 gross square feet of new retail/restaurant space.</p>
<p>• A parking deck with 3,000+ spaces that will consolidate surface parking areas and promote safety by reducing pedestrian/vehicular intersections, Simon officials stated.</p>
<p>• 21,000 gross square feet of tenant storage space.</p>
<p>• A 200-room hotel, which is expected to be built in the later stages of the project.</p>
<p>• Enhanced amenities that include a pedestrian-focused design with additional walkways, improved crosswalks and enhanced wayfinding; a new children’s play area and new and improved landscaping.</p>
<p>Woodbury Common has submitted a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to the Village of Woodbury Planning Board to begin the municipal-review process.</p>
<p>“Woodbury Common Premium Outlets has been proud to be a dynamic source of economic growth generating hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue and thousands of jobs, as well as being a caring community neighbor,” said David Mistretta, Woodbury Common Premium Outlets General Manager. “This visionary proposal will further energize Woodbury Common, Orange County and the entire Hudson Valley as a world-class shopping and tourism destination that is so crucial to the region’s economic success today and in the future.”</p>
<div id="attachment_45703" style="width: 2653px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45703" class="size-full wp-image-45703" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WoodburyCommonPhase5NewHotelRendering.jpg" alt="" width="2643" height="1317" /><p id="caption-attachment-45703" class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of the proposed hotel at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets.</p></div>
<p>A number of area politicians issued statements of support for the project, including Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, who stated, “Woodbury Common’s improvements will benefit Orange County communities and our tourism industry for years to come,” said Orange County Executive Steven Neuhaus. “We’re grateful that since Day 1, Woodbury Common has been a great neighbor, created numerous entry level and career path jobs and been a major driver of both sales tax revenue and regional economic opportunity.”</p>
<p>Village of Woodbury Mayor Andrew Giacomazza stated, “Woodbury Common has long been an elite destination because of its premier – and unique – shopping experience. This plan seeks to strengthen that brand advantage and power an even greater future. The Village of Woodbury looks forward to learning more about how this exciting proposal can benefit our residents, businesses and tax base.”</p>
<p>Woodbury Town Supervisor Thomas Burke added, “Woodbury Common has exponentially advanced quality of life in the Town of Woodbury through its economic firepower and deep involvement in our community. We eagerly await further details of this proposal and how Woodbury Common can deepen its roots to fuel a brighter economic future for our town and those who live, work and play here.”</p>
<p>Simon listed a host of benefits for the local area if the proposed development project was approved, such as:</p>
<p>• Substantial additional property and sales tax revenue to be shared by the Town and Village of Woodbury, Orange County, the Monroe-Woodbury School District, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, and police services in Woodbury and New York State.</p>
<p>• More than 3,000 jobs, including: 770 additional full-time and part-time jobs, plus an additional 296 indirect and induced jobs in New York State.</p>
<p>Nearly 2,000 direct and indirect construction jobs, including 1,659 on site.</p>
<p>Woodbury Common Premium Outlets currently employs 5,000 full-time and part-time during peak season. Woodbury Common debuted in 1985 with 25 stores encompassing 115,000 square feet. Today, it features more than 912,000 square feet of retail space and more than 250 outlet stores after completing multiple expansion projects.</p>

Year-over-year, sales fell 15.3% (down from 4.77 million in August 2022).]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales moved lower in August, according to the National Association of Realtors. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales improved in the Midwest, were unchanged in the Northeast, and slipped in the South and West. All four regions recorded year-over-year sales declines.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—slid 0.7% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.04 million in August. Year-over-year, sales fell 15.3% (down from 4.77 million in August 2022).</p>
<p>“Home sales have been stable for several months, neither rising nor falling in any meaningful way,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Mortgage rate changes will have a big impact over the short run, while job gains will have a steady, positive impact over the long run. The South had a lighter decline in sales from a year ago due to greater regional job growth since coming out of the pandemic lockdown.”</p>
<p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of August was 1.1 million units, down 0.9% from July and 14.1% from one year ago (1.28 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.3-month supply at the current sales pace, identical to July and up from 3.2 months in August 2022.</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $407,100, an increase of 3.9% from August 2022 ($391,700). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p>
<p>“Home prices continue to march higher despite lower home sales,” Yun said. “Supply needs to essentially double to moderate home price gains.”</p>
<p><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></p>
<p>According to the Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 20 days in August, unchanged from July and up from 16 days in August 2022. Seventy-two percent of homes sold in August were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in August, down from 30% in July and identical to August 2022. NAR’s 2022 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2022—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 26%, the lowest since NAR began tracking the data.</p>
<p>All-cash sales accounted for 27% of transactions in August, up from 26% in July and 24% in August 2022.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in August, the same share as in July and one year ago.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 1% of sales in August, unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p>
<p><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.18% as of September 14. That’s up from 7.12% the prior week and 6.02% one year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales waned to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.60 million in August, down 1.4% from 3.65 million in July and 15.3% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $413,500 in August, up 3.7% from August 2022.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales recorded a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 440,000 units in August, up 4.8% from July but down 15.4% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $354,600 in August, up 6.2% from the prior year ($333,900).</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>At an annual rate of 480,000 in August, existing-home sales in the Northeast were unchanged from July but down 22.6% from August 2022. The median price in the Northeast was $465,700, up 5.8% from one year ago.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales increased by 1.0% from the previous month to an annual rate of 970,000 in August, down 16.4% from the prior year. The median price in the Midwest was $305,300, up 6.8% from August 2022.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South faded 1.1% from July to an annual rate of 1.84 million in August, a decrease of 12.4% from one year ago. The median price in the South was $366,100, up 3.2% from August 2022.</p>
<p>In the West, existing-home sales slumped 2.6% from the previous month to an annual rate of 750,000 in August, down 15.7% from the prior year. The median price in the West was $609,300, up 1.0% from August 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a bill on Friday, Sept. 22 that requires home sellers to inform home buyers as to whether a property is located in a flood risk area or has previously flooded.</p>
<p>The governor signed legislation (A.1967/S.5400) which establishes a flood risk “right to know” for homebuyers. Previously sellers could opt that the buyer get a $500-credit at closing and the disclosure requirement was waived. The new law eliminates the “credit provision” and requires the disclosure of information concerning flood risk, flood history, and flood insurance on real property transactions. According to a Flash Update issued by the New York State Association of Realtors on Sept. 25, the new law will go into effect on March 20, 2024</p>
<p>NYSAR reported that Chapter 484 of the Laws of 2023 adds seven questions to the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) related to the property&#8217;s flood status and experience.</p>
<p>In June, the bill passed the Assembly by a 106-38 margin and the State Senate by a 42-21 margin. The bill was delivered to the governor on Sept. 19. The Senate Flood Risk Disclosure bill was sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-WF 47th District), while the Assembly legislation was sponsored by Robert Carroll (D-WF 44th District).</p>
<p>The governor also signed a bill that amends the environmental conservation law to require the Department of Environmental Conservation to authorize and encourage the use of nature-based solutions to stabilize tidal shorelines in the state and provides such solutions should be considered when promulgating and implementing rules and regulations</p>
<p>Hudson Valley state lawmakers, as well as leaders in the environmental community hailed the newly signed bills aimed to protect New Yorkers from the increasing instances of extreme flooding and the damage caused by these storms.</p>
<p>State Senator Shelley B. Mayer said, “After Hurricane Ida, many constituents reached out to me for assistance with flood damage. I was happy my office could help individuals, but the systemic impact of climate change requires much more. In the face of increased risk of flooding and climate change related hazards, it is critical we take proactive measures. Living shorelines can protect against flooding, improve water quality, and strengthen our resilience. I thank Governor Kathy Hochul for signing this important legislation into law. I also thank my colleague Assemblyman Steve Otis for championing this legislation in the Assembly, and Save the Sound and Riverkeeper for their work inspiring this bill in their efforts to combat climate change and for working with my office on this legislation.”</p>
<p>Assemblymember Steven Otis said, “Living shoreline principles are vital to improving coastal resilience, reducing flood impacts, preventing shoreline erosion and protecting natural habitats. Thanks go to Governor Kathy Hochul, the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Riverkeeper, The Nature Conservancy, Save the Sound and other environmental groups who support these important policies. This is important legislation for coastal communities that will help advance nature-based policies at a time when sound practices are needed.”</p>
<p>Riverkeeper Senior Manager of Government Affairs Jeremy Cherson said, “Governor Hochul’s signature of the Living Shorelines Act and Flood Risk Disclosure legislation marks a major step forward for climate resilience in New York State. Responsible management of shorelines along tidal waterways, as envisioned in the Living Shorelines Act, will help ensure that permitting decisions support natural shorelines that provide habitat for wildlife as well as flood protections for communities. With Flood Risk Disclosure, New York will increase transparency around climate risk in our real estate market, empowering home buyers with information about the flood risk to their potential property.”</p>
<p>Save the Sound Vice President of Water Protection David Ansel noted, “After several years of work, we’re thrilled to see the Living Shorelines and Flood Disclosure bills become law. The governor’s signature and the overwhelming support in the legislature show New York’s leaders understand that we must take action to adapt to the stronger storms and rising sea levels of climate change. Using natural features such as native marsh grasses and shellfish reef instead of hardened structures like seawalls benefits shoreline communities, wildlife, and water quality. Ensuring transparency about flood risks helps individuals and communities make wise decisions for their futures. We thank Governor Hochul and the bills’ sponsors for their leadership. Now we look forward to working with partners across the region to these bills’ promise into healthier, more resilient coastlines and communities.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The RFP follows the release of the “Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan” and is backed by a combined $200-million investment by New York City Mayor Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—New York City Economic Development Corporation released a Request for Proposals (RFP) on Sept. 25 for a developer to lease, redevelop, and operate the Kingsbridge Armory, one of the largest armory buildings in the world and a landmarked structure that contains approximately 570,000 square feet of space.</p>
<p>The RFP follows the release of the “Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan” and is backed by a combined $200-million investment by New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p>
<p>The Kingsbridge Armory RFP seeks to create a financially feasible, thriving, mixed-use development that:</p>
<p>• Strikes a balance between addressing the needs of the local community and creating an economic engine for the wider area;</p>
<p>• Activates the Armory and enhances its integration with the neighborhood, promoting more accessibility, transparency, and connection with the surrounding community;</p>
<p>• Serves diverse users, including those from different age groups, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and income levels;</p>
<p>• Delivers a minimum of 25,000 square feet of space to be subleased to one or more community-based organizations at discounted rates.</p>
<p>• Design the site to promote sustainability, energy efficiency, and carbon neutrality, while preserving the landmarked exterior.</p>
<p>• Responsibly develop the project by delivering a comprehensive hiring program that supports communities and creates job opportunities, including for economically disadvantaged candidates and</p>
<p>• Generate returns to the city through lease rent, tax, and payment in lieu of tax (“PILOT”) revenue.</p>
<p>“The release of this RFP demonstrates that we are serious about the redevelopment of the Kingsbridge Armory and want this historic structure to, not only remain a symbol of resiliency, but become an economic engine for the Bronx,” said NYCEDC President &amp; CEO Andrew Kimball. “In addition to economic development, we want the redeveloped armory to promote sustainability and serve diverse users in the Bronx.”</p>
<p>NYCEDC has launched sign-ups for community-based organizations (CBOs) and emerging developers to express their interest in being part of the Armory’s development (see sign-ups here and here). RFP respondents are encouraged to consider the involvement of CBOs and emerging developers when developing their proposals.</p>
<p>The release of the Kingsbridge Armory RFP was hailed by a host of Bronx political leaders.</p>
<p>“The Kingsbridge Armory embodies the resilience of our community, and after a long redevelopment journey, including failed attempts and a restart of community engagement, I am excited to reach another milestone,” said Council Member Pierina Sanchez. The publishing of NYCEDC’s Requests for Proposals for the Armory comes on the heels of nine months of community engagement—involving 4,000 community members—that resulted in the Kingsbridge Armory Vision Plan. I eagerly await RFP responses that adhere closely to the community’s vision plan and look forward to shepherding a project through the city’s land use process that brings economic transformation to our Bronx communities, prioritizes good paying, union jobs, and emphasizes the delivery of vital investments into our district’s people. With our shared vision for the Kingsbridge Armory, and historic level of public investment of $200M in this project, we will ensure the redevelopment of the Kingsbridge Armory is a success for the Bronx and this city.”</p>
<p>“The Kingsbridge Armory is an iconic symbol of our neighborhood and represents a promise that has been long unfulfilled in the Bronx,” said Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “After heeding my request on behalf of constituents, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and New York Governor Hochul put forth the largest investment that Kingsbridge has ever witnessed for one building in the amount of $200 million. Coupled with the ‘Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan,’ the Armory’s history and potential will finally be preserved and fully realized. As we enter the next phase of development of the Kingsbridge Armory with today’s RFP announcement, I encourage all eligible local community stakeholders to submit applications to rethink, reimagine, and reassert the visionary use and planning for this historic building and what it means to our community.”</p>
<p>“From the start, we have been serious about the redevelopment and reimagining of the Kingsbridge Armory and today’s announcement brings us one step closer to making this dream a reality,” said Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson. “With the release of the RFP, we are demonstrating our commitment to investing in the largest armory in the nation that has been left dormant for years but has the potential to be an economic engine for the borough and a space that is truly for the Kingsbridge community. I want to thank our Co-Chairs, Council Member Pierina Sanchez and Executive Director of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition Sandra Lobo, Community Working Group Members, the New York City Economic Development Corporation, my colleagues in government, our Deputy Borough President, community members, and everyone else who has contributed time and labor to this project, our vision plan, and to getting us to this point. Together, we will get it done and have an armory truly reflective of the needs and wants of our residents and families in the Bronx.”</p>
<p>“In the heart of the Bronx, the Kingsbridge Armory stands as a symbol of boundless potential and resilience, poised to become a dynamic economic catalyst,” said New York State Senator Robert Jackson. “This Request for Proposals (RFP), unveiled by the NYC Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and backed by investments from New York City and New York State, affirms the dedication to its renaissance. In unity, we forge not just bricks and mortar but also aspirations into the very bedrock of the armory, creating a sustainable, inclusive nucleus for our community&#8217;s future.”</p>
<p>“After the successful community-led “Together for Kingsbridge” vision plan and with a $200 million commitment from the State and City, the release of this much anticipated RFP brings us one step closer to ensuring the Kingsbridge Armory reaches its full potential for our community,” said State Senator Gustavo Rivera. “Proposals will need to reflect our vision for the transformation of this neighborhood icon and ensure our community will benefit from its redevelopment. I cannot help but feel optimistic about the future of this project and its significance for the Bronx.”</p>
<p>“The Kingsbridge Armory is one of the Bronx’s greatest assets,” said Assemblymember George Alvarez. “The Kingsbridge Armory is in the heart of the 78th Assembly District which I am proud to represent. Today’s RFP release represents an important day for our District and I am excited to see what the future holds and contribute to the success of the ‘Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan.’”</p>
<p>Responses to the RFP are due by 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18th, 2024. An optional information session was scheduled on Tuesday, October 10th at 10:30 a.m. with more details available in the RFP.</p>
<p>The “Together for Kingsbridge Vision Plan” synthesized a robust nine-month public engagement process focused on the future of the Armory. Through a collaborative effort led by NYCEDC, the process gathered feedback from more than 4,000 participants and included over 950 survey responses, nine Community Board meetings, 16 small group discussions, and conversations with approximately 75 additional stakeholders across various industries. Participants included local elected officials, and representatives from community-based organizations, nearby schools and colleges, health care providers, merchant associations and labor.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The ownership stated that the plan, if approved as submitted, would entail the largest conversion of an enclosed shopping mall into a mixed-use residential and retail use, along with open space, in the New York metro region.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—In what is clearly the most anticipated development proposal to hit the desks of city leaders in decades, Pacific Retail Capital Partners, The Cappelli Organization, SL Green Realty Corporation, and Aareal Bank, owners of The Galleria at White Plains, presented a $2.5-billion redevelopment plan for the property to the White Plains Common Council on Sept. 28.</p>
<p>The ownership stated that the plan, if approved as submitted, would entail the largest conversion of an enclosed shopping mall into a mixed-use residential and retail use, along with open space, in the New York metro region. The plan calls for the demolition of the 43-year-old shuttered Galleria at White Plains shopping mall and the development of seven residential towers of varying heights that would feature up to 3,200 apartments including 384 that would be designated as affordable in accordance with the City of White Plains Affordable Rental Housing Regulations. The submission to the City Council calls for a zone change of the property.</p>
<p>The buildings would combine state-of-the-art technology and building systems with amenity-based retail for the residential units including fitness, grocery, dining, professional and personal services. The District Galleria is being designed as a sustainable project, meeting the silver LEED standard of high-energy efficient building materials, the building ownership stated.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the project’s footprint is designated as open space that would break down existing barriers and create a quarter mile-long green promenade complete with pet playgrounds, pocket parks and landscaping for community gatherings, outdoor events, public entertainment and art.</p>
<p>The District Galleria would also feature a garden promenade designed to link the adjacent neighborhoods at eight different access points.</p>
<p>Annmarie Plenge, Executive Vice President of Design for PRCP, is the Master Architectural Designer of the project. Plenge brings more than 27 years of professional experience master planning large-scale mixed-use projects and is collaborating with world renowned architectural design and planning firm Gensler, along with Kimley Horn and Eric Rain Landscape Architecture to design the project.</p>
<p>“Experience driven mixed-use environments appeal to people’s desire for connection and belonging. They are poised to be the key in reviving our communities’ urban centers. The evolution of an enclosed mall to an open-air mixed-use development with the unified vision of The District Galleria is pivotal in evolving real estate for the next generation,” said Najla Kayyem, Executive Vice President for Pacific Retail Capital Partners.</p>
<p>In 2022, Pacific Retail and Aareal Bank developed a joint venture partnership to undertake the redevelopment of the Galleria at White Plains site with New York City-based SL Green Realty Corporation and the Cappelli Organization, which is headquartered in White Plains.</p>
<p>“As an urban renewal project that began more than 50 years ago, the reimagining of this property is integral to the transformation of Downtown White Plains, which began in earnest over 20 years ago with City Center. The District Galleria will go a long way in making our local community more enjoyable, desirable, sustainable, and resilient,” said Chief Executive Officer/Founder of the Cappelli Organization, Louis Cappelli.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The typical Broker of Record was a manager or owner of a single office firm and identified as a broker owner. The typical firm was an independent, non-franchised firm with three full time real estate licensees.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Housing affordability, maintaining sufficient inventory and keeping up with technology were among the biggest challenges cited for firms in the next two years, according to the &#8220;2023 Profile of Real Estate Firms&#8221; report by the National Association of Realtors released on Oct. 4.</p>
<p>The report measures characteristics of firms nationwide to determine how they operate and assess what lies ahead. NAR surveyed its broker members of record to better understand firms’ demographics, composition and characteristics from the executive and manager perspective.</p>
<p>“With interest rates rising to more than 20-year highs, it is no surprise that the biggest current concern for real estate firms is housing affordability,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “This surpassed the concern of maintaining sufficient inventory, which we saw in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Real Estate Firms</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, the overwhelming majority of real estate firms—81%—operated from a single office and typically had three full-time real estate licensees. Roughly nine out of 10 firms —86%—were independent and non-franchised.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of brokers of record—31% —were CEOs, COOs, presidents or owners of a multi-office firm. Almost two-thirds—65%—were managers or owners of a single-office firm.</p>
<p>The typical Broker of Record was a manager or owner of a single office firm and identified as a broker owner. The typical firm was an independent, non-franchised firm with three full time real estate licensees. The typical residential firm had been operating for 16 years (same as the 2021 report), while the typical commercial firm had been operating for 25 years (down from 30 years).</p>
<p>Other Characteristics of Real Estate Firms data includes:</p>
<p>• 78% identified as broker owners and 11% as broker managers.</p>
<p>• 81% of real estate firms had a single office, typically with three full time real estate licensees, in line with the 2021 report.</p>
<p>• 86% of firms were independent non-franchised firms, and 12% were independent franchised firms.</p>
<p>• 80% of firms specialized in residential brokerage.</p>
<p>• 38% of firms were LLCs, 28% S Corps, 24% sole proprietorships, and 7% were C Corps.</p>
<p>• 38% of firms covered a metropolitan region market area, 26% covered a rural area or small town, and 18% covered multiple metro areas or regions.</p>
<p><strong>Business Activity of Real Estate Firms</strong></p>
<p>Single-office firms had a median brokerage sales volume of $5.3 million and 15 real estate transaction sides last year, up from $4.5 million and down from 19 transaction sides, respectively, in 2020. Firms with four or more offices had a median brokerage sales volume of $154.6 million and 403 transaction sides in 2022, an increase from $146.2 million and a decrease from 571 transaction sides two years ago.</p>
<p>The typical firm generated 48% of its sales volume from repeat business from past clients and 47% from past client referrals.</p>
<p>“Housing affordability has had an impact on real estate firms’ overall sales activity,” explained Lautz. “There are fewer buyers who can purchase a home due to the rise in prices and interest rates, and fewer sellers are motivated to make a move. While sales are down, sales volume has increased as home prices have augmented because of limited inventory.”</p>
<p>Other Business Activity Data includes:</p>
<p>With historically low inventory and higher mortgage rates, residential firms experienced fewer sales transactions, while a recovering economy and return to office provided more sales transactions for commercial firms. However, compared to 2020 both residential and commercial firms had higher sales dollar volumes in 2022. Firms were most likely to provide business brokerage and commercial consulting services as ancillary to their primary services.</p>
<p>• Firms typically received 48% of their customer inquiries from repeat business from past clients, and 49% from past client referrals.</p>
<p>• Many firms had the capability to offer in house ancillary services to real estate clients. The most common in-house service was business brokerage, followed by commercial consulting services, relocation services, and staging services.</p>
<p>• 43% of current competition came from traditional brick and mortar large franchise firms and 29% from traditional brick and mortar single office firms.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits Real Estate Firms Provide to Agents and Staff</strong></p>
<p>Errors and omissions/liability insurance was cited as the most common benefit—43%—which firms offered to independent contractors, licensees and agents. E-signature, comparative market analysis, electronic contracts/forms and multiple listing were the most common tools provided or encouraged by firms. A quarter (25%) of all firms offered a virtual office space for agents and staff, while 8% offered a virtual assistant.</p>
<p>Other Benefits Real Estate Firms Provide Data include:</p>
<p>• Among administrative staff, 29% received errors and omissions/liability insurance, 25% received vacation/sick days, and 10% received health insurance.</p>
<p>• 35% of senior management received errors and omissions/liability insurance, 16% received vacation/sick days, and 11% received health insurance.</p>
<p>• The most common tools provided or encouraged by firms are e-signature, comparative market analysis, multiple listing, and electronic contracts/forms.</p>
<p>• 4% of firms with one office operate a non-profit foundation, compared to 25% of firms with four or more offices.</p>
<p>• 76% of firms encourage agents to pursue certifications and designations, and 62% encourage agents to take additional training classes.</p>
<p><strong>Future Outlook of Real Estate Firms</strong></p>
<p>Nearly one-third of firms—30%—expect profitability or net income from all real estate activities to increase this year, down from 58% in 2021.</p>
<p>When asked about generational effects on the real estate industry in the next two years, the top concerns for firms were young adults’ ability to buy a home (63%), young adults’ view of homeownership (38%) and baby boomers retiring from real estate (27%).</p>
<p>“Due to tight inventory, the outlook among real estate firms is more conservative since the pandemic-induced housing boom,” Lautz said. “Only 30% of real estate firms believe there will be an increase in profitability from all real estate activities, compared to 58% two years ago.”</p>
<p>Other Future Outlook of Real Estate Firms Data include:</p>
<p>Two-fifths of firms are actively recruiting sales agents in 2023, mainly due to growth in their primary business, and nearly one third expect profitability to increase this year. Firms expect their 2023 competition to increase mainly from virtual firms and non-traditional market participants. As a sign of current market conditions, the biggest challenges cited by firms for the next two years were housing affordability and maintaining sufficient inventory, and nearly two thirds were concerned with young adults&#8217; ability to purchase a home.</p>
<p>• 40% of firms reported they were actively recruiting sales agents in 2023.</p>
<p>• 38% of firms expected competition to increase in 2023 from virtual firms and 28% from non-traditional market participants.</p>
<p>• 64% of firms expected competition in 2023 to stay the same from traditional brick and mortar single office firms, while 62% expected competition to stay the same from larger traditional brick and mortar firms.</p>
<p>• 40% of all firms said they had an exit plan for when they decide to retire or exit the real estate industry.</p>
<p>• 12% of all firms had real estate teams with a median of three people per team.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Methodology</strong></p>
<p>In July 2023, NAR invited a random sample of 176,291 Realtors who were executives and senior management at real estate firms to fill out an online survey. NAR received 5,889 usable responses for an overall response rate of 3.3%. The confidence interval at a 95% level of confidence was +/-1.27% based on the share of real estate executives at real estate firms. All information in this report was representative of member characteristics, sales and lease transaction values, and other statistics from the calendar year of 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The New York State Association of Realtors announced on Oct. 6 it had honored Leah Caro of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors as the “Alan Yassky Distinguished Service Award” winner during the association’s recent 2023 “Elevate Your Profession” Fall Business Meetings held at the Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino in Verona, NY.</p>
<p>Caro is the President and Principal Broker of Park Sterling Realty in Bronxville. She is the fourth winner of the Alan Yassky Award, which recognizes significant industry contributions throughout a Realtor’s career at the local, state and national level. These leaders are true professionals and outstanding citizens in their community, NYSAR stated.</p>
<p>Caro was the 2009 President of the Westchester-Putnam Association of Realtors (a predecessor organization of HGAR) and the 2015 President of the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service. She received HGAR’s first President’s Award in 2013 and was the association’s Realtor of the Year in 2012. Additionally, she was bestowed HGAR’s Albert P. Schatz Legislative Award in 2018.</p>
<p>She has served NYSAR since 2007 and has been an active member of the state association’s Board of Directors. She has been a staunch supporter of the Realtors Political Action Committee (RPAC) and has led NYSAR’s “Hill Visits” to Washington, DC for more than a decade. She currently serves as the Federal Political Coordinator to U.S. Rep. Jamal Bowman.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge honor to be acknowledged by my peers, many of whom have been serving with integrity and passion for many years as well,” Caro said. “I thank you for this honor.”</p>
<p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica said of Caro’s award: “Leah Caro embodies the spirit of Realtor activism. It is a fundamental role of every Realtor Association to promote public policies and candidates who believe in building strong communities, protecting property rights, and creating a vibrant business climate. For decades Leah Caro has staunchly advocated for Realtors at the local, state and national levels. As the President of HGAR, I am proud to say that Leah has been a role model and inspiration to me over the years that I have served with her, and I can think of no better person more deserving of the Alan Yassky Distinguished Service Award than Leah Caro.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—After brokerage firm Redfin recently announced its intent to leave the National Association of Realtors over sexual harassment allegations that led to NAR President Kenny Parcell’s resignation, comes news that two other major brokerage firms will not require its brokers or agents to be members of the embattled organization as part of settlement agreements in pending anti-trust litigation.</p>
<p>National real estate brokerage firms Anywhere Real Estate Inc. and RE/MAX, LLC recently announced terms of its previously proposed settlement agreements in the <em>Burnett</em> and <em>Moehrl</em> antitrust class action litigation in which NAR and several other brokerages are also defendants. In addition to NAR, Anywhere and RE/MAX, HomeServices of America and Keller Williams are also defendants in that litigation that centers on NAR’s Participation Rule.</p>
<p>Anywhere Real Estate (formerly known as Realogy Holdings Corp.) announced on Oct. 6 that it had agreed to pay $83.5 million to settle all claims in connection with the Burnett and Moehrl cases. The company stated that the proposed settlement “is not an admission of liability, nor does it concede or validate any of the claims asserted against Anywhere.” The proposed settlement includes injunctive relief requiring practice changes in Anywhere Advisors, the company&#8217;s-owned brokerage operations, which includes Coldwell Banker Realty, Corcoran, and Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty, for a period of five years following final court approval.</p>
<p>In addition, Anywhere has also agreed to recommend and encourage these same practice changes to its independently owned and operated franchise network across the Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Corcoran, ERA, and Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty brands.</p>
<p>A hearing for preliminary approval of the settlement is expected to occur in November with final court approval expected in mid-2024.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that Anywhere has reached a nationwide settlement with the plaintiffs in the Burnett and Moehrl cases,” said Ryan Schneider, Anywhere Chief Executive Officer and President. “We believe this is the right course of action to remove future uncertainty and ongoing legal expense, serving the best interests of the company, our affiliated agents and franchisees, and shareholders, and enabling Anywhere to focus on moving real estate to what&#8217;s next.”</p>
<p>“The proposed settlement provides releases for our owned brokerage operations and agents as well as our franchisees and their affiliated agents, a priority for Anywhere in resolving these claims,” said Sue Yannaccone, Chief Executive Officer and President, Anywhere Brands and Anywhere Advisors.</p>
<p>Among some of the key components of the proposed settlement agreement include:</p>
<p>• Anywhere will prohibit company owned brokerages and their affiliated agents from claiming buyer agent services are free.</p>
<p>• Anywhere will require company owned brokerages and their affiliated agents to include the listing broker&#8217;s offer of compensation for prospective buyers&#8217; agents as soon as possible in each active listing, consistent with MLS rules and/or capabilities of third-party website operators.</p>
<p>• Anywhere will prohibit company-owned brokerages and their affiliated agents from using any technology (or manual methods) to sort listings by offers of compensation, unless requested by the client.</p>
<p>• Anywhere has agreed to advise and remind company-owned brokerages, franchisees, and affiliated agents that the company has no rule requiring offers of compensation.</p>
<p>• Anywhere will not require company-owned brokerages, franchisees, or affiliated agents to belong to the National Association of Realtors or follow the NAR Code of Ethics or MLS Handbook.</p>
<p>• Anywhere will require company-owned brokerages and their agents to clearly disclose to clients that commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable.</p>
<p>• Anywhere will eliminate any minimum client commission requirements that company-owned brokerages may have.</p>
<p>• Anywhere has agreed to develop training materials for company-owned brokerages, franchisees, and affiliated agents that support all the practice changes outlined in the injunctive relief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, RE/MAX has agreed to pay $55 million in a proposed settlement agreement in the Burnett and Moehrl class action lawsuits.</p>
<div id="attachment_45884" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45884" class="size-full wp-image-45884" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Nick_Bailey.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="310" /><p id="caption-attachment-45884" class="wp-caption-text">RE/MAX President and CEO Nick Bailey</p></div>
<p>On Oct. 6, RE/MAX President and CEO Nick Bailey in an update to its Affiliates, released terms of the proposed settlement that also included that the brokerage “will not require you to be members of the National Association of Realtors or follow NAR&#8217;s Code of Ethics or the MLS Handbook. All U.S. RE/MAX brokerages will be free to determine whether NAR membership works best for them and their agents—and we’ll support the choice either way. RE/MAX, LLC also won’t hold affiliates to any current requirements in these areas.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s important to note that the nationwide settlement, which requires court approval, would release RE/MAX, LLC, the U.S. independent regions, and U.S. RE/MAX brokerages and affiliates—all of you—from any claims related to these lawsuits. It would also settle, on a nationwide basis, any similar claims that could be brought.,” Bailey stated. “We continue to deny the allegations made in the complaints and in no way acknowledge any wrongdoing. We also continue to believe in buyer agency, cooperative compensation and the idea that consumers are best served when they are working with real estate professionals.  At the same time, we believe that protecting the network from costly litigation and the risk of further damages makes this settlement the right course of action.”</p>
<p>RE/MAX’s proposed settlement agreement mirrors many of the key provisions of Anywhere’s settlement terms, include that the company “will continue to not express or imply a minimum commission requirement in any of our franchise agreements, training materials or other policies. In other words, RE/MAX brokerages and agents will continue to have the freedom to set and/or negotiate commissions as they see fit,” Bailey stated.</p>
<p>The Burnett trial in Missouri is set to begin later this month. In early September when reports surfaced that Anywhere Real Estate had reached a settlement agreement, NAR stated that it would continue arguing its case against the two class-action lawsuits challenging real estate compensation structures.</p>
<p>“Settlement is always an option for any party in litigation. NAR’s commitment to defend ourselves in court remains unchanged, and we are confident we will prevail in proving the lawfulness of the rules under attack,” Mantill Williams, NAR’s Vice President of Public Relations and Communication Strategy, said in a statement. “Pro-competitive, pro-consumer local MLS broker marketplaces ensure equity, efficiency, transparency and market-driven pricing options for home buyers and sellers. The practice of the listing broker paying the buyer broker’s compensation saves sellers time and money by having so many buyer brokers participating in that local marketplace and, thus, creating a larger pool of buyers for sellers. For buyers, these marketplaces save them the burden of extra costs at closing, enable them to receive professional representation and make homeownership possible for more people.”</p>
<p>Multiple published reports indicated NAR had announced a change in how it interprets its Participation Rule, which requires listing brokers to provide buyer brokers an offer of compensation in order to list on the multiple listing service (MLS), according to <em>HousingWire</em>.</p>
<p><em>Inman New</em>s first reported on Oct. 6 that while NAR previously stated that the offer of compensation could be as little as a penny or a dollar, NAR now states that listing brokers can offer nothing and still comply with its Participation Rule.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—After detailing a laundry list of problems that have caused a “difficult year” for the real estate markets thus far in 2023, NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun told a gathering of about 100 HGAR members and affiliates that he believes the home sales market will improve in 2024.</p>
<p>In his first-ever appearance before the HGAR membership, Yun gave a near hour-long presentation on the current state of the residential, commercial and lending markets at the HGAR offices in White Plains on Oct. 10 and concluded his remarks by saying that existing home and new homes sales will improve next year as interest rates begin to fall.</p>
<p>Yun blamed high interest rates, inflation and low inventory for the residential market’s current woes. He said that residential sales as of July 2023 were down 21% as compared to the year before and that current sales are below pre-COVID totals.</p>
<p>“This past year has been a little bit tough on commercial real estate as well as residential,” Yun said. In addition to high interest rates depleting the buyer pool, he noted that there is very little inventory for prospective home buyers to choose from.</p>
<p>While the existing home sales market has suffered in 2023, the new home market has held its own and will likely post an increase in sales as compared to 2022. Yun also predicted that new home sales will rise even further in 2024.</p>
<p>“Right now, transactional activity is down not only because of high interest rates, but because of the lack of listings,” he said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-45939 aligncenter" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NAR-EXISTING-HOME-SALES.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>The high interest rates have caused significant damage to the economy and particularly to the real estate markets. In addition, to residential and commercial transactions being lower in 2023, the high rates have resulted in a decline in commercial real estate prices, a crisis in the community banking sector due to an interest rate mismatch and high commercial real estate loan exposure. Earlier this year, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed and put the spotlight on the troubles ahead for the community banking sector.</p>
<p>Yun estimated that of the approximately 5,000 community banks nationwide, about 2,000 will be in trouble due to current market conditions. He also predicted that commercial real estate foreclosures will increase over the next two years as loans become due. According to Trepp, there is approximately $270 billion in commercial mortgages held by banks due to expire this year and a total of $1.4 trillion in loans coming due in the next five years.</p>
<div id="attachment_45938" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45938" class="wp-image-45938" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LAWRENNCE-YUN-AT-HGAR.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-45938" class="wp-caption-text">NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun</p></div>
<p>Yun said that the inflation rate (Consumer Price Index), which was 2% pre-COVID, rose sharply to a high of 9% in 2022, but has since trended sharply downward to 3.7% in August, close to the Federal Reserve Board’s target of 2%. Yun contends that the Fed should pause any further rate hikes to allow the economy to perhaps reach the 2% CPI on its own.</p>
<p>“Stop raising interest rates,” Yun has told the Federal Reserve. “Just give it time. It is trending in the right direction.” He noted that the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders recently sent a joint letter to the Federal Reserve requesting a pause in any further interest rate increases for a few months to see if the inflation rate will fall even further in reaction to past interest rate increases.</p>
<p>Yun predicts that come the spring of 2024, lending rates will be in the mid 6% area. He told Real Estate In-Depth that a few months ago he predicted rates would be in the low sixes, but now due to current conditions, he now believes rates will be in the mid sixes in the spring of next year. For the week ended Sept. 29, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased for the fourth consecutive week to 7.53%– the highest rate since 2000.</p>
<p>With rates going down, Dr. Yun expects more listings to hit the market and more buyers as well. He said life circumstances will prompt more sellers to put their homes on the market for sale over the next two years. Among the favorable demographic data Yun cited include: 7 million new-born babies, 3 million marriages, 1.5 million divorces, 7 million people turning 65 years old, 4 million deaths and 50 million job switches.</p>
<p>“It has been a difficult two years but I think things will be much, much better next year,” Yun said. “Maybe total sales will still likely be below pre-COVID 2019 conditions, but it will be improved conditions as we go into next year.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[As a result of an agreement with OAG and a separate settlement with Westchester Residential Opportunities (WRO), a White Plains-based local fair housing group who brought their own litigation against PIG for their discriminatory behavior, PIG must set aside 20 units in its portfolio for applicants u]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an agreement on Oct. 10 with New Rochelle-based real estate company and property manager, Platzner International Group (PIG), its owners Merrick Platzner and Harrin Platzner, and their various properties for denying housing to low-income residents in Westchester County.</p>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General, with assistance from the Housing Rights Initiative, found that PIG violated federal, state, and local fair housing laws by denying housing to low-income New Yorkers with Section 8 Housing Choice vouchers. As a result of an agreement with OAG and a separate settlement with Westchester Residential Opportunities (WRO), a White Plains-based local fair housing group who brought their own litigation against PIG for their discriminatory behavior, PIG must set aside 20 units in its portfolio for applicants using Section 8 vouchers or other housing subsidies. PIG must also waive broker fees for any prospective tenant using housing subsidies for the next five years and pay $10,000 to HRI and $95,000 to WRO in damages.</p>
<p>“Every New Yorker, regardless of their income, deserves a place to live,” said Attorney General James. “Denying housing opportunities to low-income New Yorkers simply because they have a housing voucher is not only illegal, it worsens our affordable housing crisis. This agreement will help ensure that renters are treated fairly and will make it clear to brokers and landlords that discrimination will not be tolerated in New York. I want to thank the Housing Rights Initiative and Westchester Residential Opportunities for their help with this investigation and their ongoing and dedicated work to fight housing discrimination in our communities.”</p>
<p>PIG and its related entities own more than 200 residential units across four multi-building complexes and are property managers for an additional 14 residential complexes primarily in Pelham Manor, New Rochelle, and Rye. In November 2021, OAG launched an investigation into PIG based on undercover testing done by HRI that revealed PIG had an explicit policy of refusing to rent units to Section 8 voucher holders in certain buildings. Apartment listings from PIG entities stated, “Sorry, NO section 8,” and a representative from HRI was told that PIG “does not take Section 8” at one of their buildings.</p>
<p>The OAG investigation also found that PIG asked illegal questions to prospective tenants on their rental applications, inquiring about potential tenant’s sex and marital status, a violation of New York’s Human Rights Law and federal fair housing law. In addition, the OAG investigation found that PIG claimed in their rental application that the application fee was as high as $50, a violation of New York State law, which mandates they do not exceed $20.</p>
<p>Housing discrimination based on source of income is illegal under fair housing and human rights laws. Owners, landlords, property managers, rental agents, and brokers are barred from refusing to accept potential tenants solely because they receive lawful housing assistance. Government-issued rental vouchers, such as the Section 8 Housing Choice voucher program, provide housing assistance to the lowest-income households to rent decent, safe housing in the private market. These programs also aid senior citizens and disabled persons on fixed incomes, displaced families, and homeless individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>As part of an agreement with OAG, PIG will pay $10,000 for HRI’s damages and $95,000 in damages to WRO in their litigation. PIG will also implement an antidiscrimination policy that conforms with federal, state, and local housing laws, and explicitly include in all rental listings that Section 8 vouchers will be accepted. They will also be required to set aside 20 units for tenants holding government housing subsidies like the Section 8 Housing Choice voucher. In addition, the Platzners, their staff, and partners will have to undergo mandatory training on relevant federal, state, and local fair housing laws and be subject to random compliance testing.</p>
<p>“Housing enforcement is the difference between a family being able to use their housing voucher and being homeless,” said Aaron Carr, Founder and Executive Director of Housing Rights Initiative. “We thank Attorney General James and her team for their partnership in proactively and systematically enforcing New York State’s anti-discrimination laws and holding brokers and landlords accountable.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be able to work with Attorney General James’ Office to fight discrimination against voucher holders who are denied equal access to housing opportunities solely because of their lawful source of income,” said Marlene Zarfes, Executive Director of Westchester Residential Opportunities. “Source of Income discrimination is widespread and targets the most vulnerable of our society. This settlement should remind housing providers of their equal housing obligations and help to increase housing opportunities for voucher holders as intended under state and county fair housing laws.”</p>
<p>Zarfes added, “Open and equal access to housing for holders of Section 8 and other housing vouchers is fundamental to the fair housing rights of voucher holders, and vital to the proper functioning of the Section 8 program.”</p>
<p>“Attorney General Letitia James is looking out for all New Yorkers—and Westchester residents—by ensuring all have a fair shot when looking for a place to live. We are facing a housing crisis and increasing access to those in need is one step toward solving this longstanding challenge,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.</p>
<p>Last year, Attorney General James took action to stop “tenant blacklisting” and partnered with HRI to stop the real estate company Compass from denying housing to low-income New Yorkers. In July 2022, she recovered nearly $300,000 of illegally withheld security deposits for Brooklyn tenants. In April 2022, she sued Brooklyn-based eviction lawyers for engaging in deceptive rent collection practices and initiating frivolous lawsuits against New York tenants.</p>
<p>The Platzner matter is being led by Sandra Giorno-Tocco, Assistant Attorney General for Public Advocacy in the Westchester Regional Office of the Attorney General led by Jill Faber, Deputy Attorney General for Regional Affairs and Jane Landry-Reyes, Assistant Attorney General in the Housing Protection Unit, led by Brent Meltzer, Chief of the Housing Protection Unit. The Housing Protection Unit is a part of the Division for Social Justice, which is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Meghan Faux and overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.</p>
<p>WRO was represented by Mariann Wang and Daniel Mullkoff of Cuti Hecker Wang LLP. WRO’s investigative and enforcement work in this case was made possible by funding from Enterprise Community Partners under the Eliminating Barriers to Housing in New York program and from New York State Homes and Community Renewal.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—After detailing a laundry list of problems that have caused a “difficult year” for the real estate markets thus far in 2023, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun told a gathering of about 100 HGAR members and affiliates that he believes the home sales market will improve in 2024.</p><p>In his first-ever appearance before the HGAR membership, Yun gave a near hour-long presentation on the current state of the residential, commercial and lending markets at the HGAR offices in White Plains on Oct. 10 and concluded his remarks by saying that existing home and new homes sales will improve next year as interest rates begin to fall.</p><blockquote>Yun blamed high interest rates, inflation and low inventory for the residential market’s current woes. He said that residential sales as of July 2023 were down 21% as compared to the year before and that current sales are below pre-COVID totals.</blockquote><p>“This past year has been a little bit tough on commercial real estate as well as residential,” Yun said. In addition to high interest rates depleting the buyer pool, he noted that there is very little inventory for prospective home buyers to choose from.</p><p>While the existing home sales market has suffered in 2023, the new home market has held its own and will likely post an increase in sales as compared to 2022. Yun also predicted that new home sales will rise even further in 2024.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2023/10/LAWRENNCE-YUN-AT-HGAR-819x1024-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="819" height="819" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/LAWRENNCE-YUN-AT-HGAR-819x1024-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2023/10/LAWRENNCE-YUN-AT-HGAR-819x1024-1.jpg 819w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chief Economist Lawrence Young, National Association of REALTORS®</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Right now, transactional activity is down not only because of high interest rates, but because of the lack of listings,” he said.</p><p>The high interest rates have caused significant damage to the economy and particularly the real estate markets. In addition, to residential and commercial transactions being lower in 2023, the high rates have resulted in a decline in commercial real estate prices, a crisis in the community banking sector due to an interest rate mismatch and high commercial real estate loan exposure. Earlier this year, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed and put the spotlight on the troubles ahead for the community banking sector.</p><p>Yun estimated that of the approximately 5,000 community banks nationwide, about 2,000 will be in trouble due to current market conditions. He also predicted that commercial real estate foreclosures will increase over the next two years as loans become due. According to Trepp, there is approximately $270 billion in commercial mortgages held by banks due to expire this year and a total of $1.4 trillion in loans coming due in the next five years.</p><p>Yun said that the inflation rate (Consumer Price Index), which was 2% pre-COVID, rose sharply to a high of 9% in 2022, but has since trended sharply downward to 3.7% in August, close to the Federal Reserve Board’s target of 2%. Yun contends that the Fed should pause any further rate hikes to allow the economy to perhaps reach the 2% CPI on its own.</p><p>“Stop raising interest rates,” Yun has told the Federal Reserve. “Just give it time. It is trending in the right direction.” He noted that the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders recently sent a joint letter to the Federal Reserve requesting a pause in any further interest rate increases for a few months to see if the inflation rate will fall even further in reaction to past interest rate increases.</p><p>Yun predicts that come the spring of 2024, lending rates will be in the mid 6% area. He told Real Estate In-Depth that a few months ago he predicted rates would be in the low sixes, but now due to current conditions, he now believes rates will be in the mid sixes in the spring of next year. For the week ended Sept. 29, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased for the fourth consecutive week to 7.53%– the highest rate since 2000.</p><p>With rates going down, he expects more listings to hit the market and more buyers as well. He said life circumstances will prompt more sellers to put their homes on the market for sale over the next two years. Among the favorable demographic data Yun cited include: 7 million new-born babies, 3 million marriages, 1.5 million divorces, 7 million people turning 65-years old, 4 million deaths and 50 million job switches.</p><p>“It has been a difficult two years but I think things will be much, much better next year,” Yun said. “Maybe total sales will still likely be below pre-COVID 2019 conditions, but it will be improved conditions as we go into next year.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>If you’re anyone involved in the real estate industry today, you know the environment is a vortex of laws, litigation and issues. However, from 30,000 feet you can get a calmer, bigger picture of what’s going on. Today, I’ll be your pilot and take you up into the air for a bird’s eye view of what’s happening around you, so place your trays in the upright position and fasten your seatbelts.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>Cold calling is still tied to any state of emergency. Currently, there are two states of emergencies (gun violence and asylum seekers) and even though they are wholly unrelated to real estate, they are in place and, therefore, it prohibits anyone from cold calling a member of the public regarding any possible future business unless they already have an established relationship.</p>
<p>However, there is a new law that increases the fine for cold calling from $11,000 to $20,000 for each violation.</p>
<p><strong>Property Condition Disclosure Statement</strong></p>
<p>A new law was passed that requires the addition of mold and flood disclosure information on the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). But, more importantly, the law now prohibits the option to “opt-out” of the execution of the form for a payment of $500 at the closing by the seller. This law takes effect on March 20, 2024; meaning that if you have a listing that goes under contract on March 20, the form must be provided. If prior to that date, you can still waive the form and pay the $500. There are some issues with this law, including the fact that it has no enforcement or punishment provision if the form is not provided. There is also the question of whether the parties can agree to waive the PCDS. Some attorneys are looking to find loopholes in the law. Stay tuned for developments as this matter progresses.</p>
<p><strong>NY Salary Transparency Law</strong></p>
<p>New York State now requires that any job posting for an employee must now provide a salary range. While this may not appear to directly affect real estate agents, it may affect brokerages that hire employees, including assistants who work for real estate agents. Additionally, while independent contracts may not be required to comply with this rule, those of you who perform work in New York City are required to comply with the city’s salary transparency law, which does apply to independent contractors. NYSAR has stated that it would be a best practice to include the following language (or similar) when looking to hire: “Real estate agents wanted. Compensation is based on commissions only.”</p>
<p><strong>0% Cooperating Compensation on the MLS</strong></p>
<p>Previously, OneKey MLS required a nominal cooperating compensation on every listing that went on the Multiple Listing Service. Often, members would see cooperating compensation of $1.00. However, recently, in line with NAR’s clarification and other MLS actions, OneKey MLS has now indicated that offering $0.00 is, in fact, offered compensation. They emphasized that while $0.00 cooperating compensation is permissible, no member is required to offer that and that all members are encouraged to freely negotiate commissions with their clients. They further encouraged buyer agents to provide their value proposition to their clients and negotiate buyer agency agreements.</p>
<p><strong>National Association of Realtors Litigation</strong></p>
<p>Sitzer/Burnett and Moehrl Cases: These suits allege that some NAR rules, including one that requires listing brokers to offer buyer brokers a commission in order to list a property on the MLS, violate the Sherman Antitrust Act by inflating seller costs. In effect, they claim that commission rates are too high, buyer brokers are being paid too much, and NAR’s Code of Conduct and MLS Handbook, along with the corporate defendants’ practices, lead to price fixing. NAR’s position is that its rules are intentionally pro-consumer and pro-competitive.</p>
<p>Both lawsuits were certified as class actions. Sitzer/Burnett is scheduled for trial beginning Oct. 16, 2023, and should last approximately three weeks. In that suit, plaintiffs seek reimbursement of $1.3 billion in commissions, as well as treble damages, which could amount to around $4 billion.</p>
<p>Two parties have agreed to settle in these lawsuits. Those parties are Anywhere Real Estate Inc., and RE/MAX. Most importantly regarding these settlements is that both defendant parties have agreed to a settlement payment to plaintiffs, they will remind all agents that the company has no rule requiring offers of compensation, that all compensation is fully negotiable, and that brokerages may choose not to belong to NAR or follow the NAR Code of Ethics or MLS Handbook. However, while brokerages may give authority to permit offices/agents to withdraw from NAR membership, this does not negate the MLS membership requirement that many MLSs carry that indicates that in order to gain access to the MLS, you must be a NAR member.</p>
<p>Regardless of outcome, it is anticipated that an appeal will be filed by the non-prevailing party and it will be years before we see the full results of this litigation.</p>
<p>A possible outcome of this litigation would be that, in a worst-case scenario setting, agents would be prohibited from offering cooperating compensation to buyers. In a best-case scenario, things would be “business as usual.”</p>
<p>What is encouraged as a best practice is that agents begin to have a dialogue with their buyer clients to establish their value proposition and employ exclusive or non-exclusive buyer agency agreements that set forth compensation paid for by the buyer in the event that the listing agent does not offer any cooperating compensation. This may also require brokerages to review their New York State Standard Operating Procedures and educate their agents as to the different ways in which buyer agents can collect commissions.</p>
<p><strong>Redfin</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the recent NAR sexual harassment and hostile workplace allegations, Redfin has indicated that, although not required, it is permitting its brokerages to withdraw from NAR membership.</p>
<p>Again, this permissive authority to withdraw from NAR membership does not negate the fact that many MLSs require NAR membership to gain access to the MLS.</p>
<p><strong>REX Litigation</strong></p>
<p>In this litigation, REX, a real estate company sued, NAR, Zillow, and Trulia, alleging that NAR conspired with these portals to separate MLS listing and non-MLS listings, as well as asserting that Zillow’s actions amounted to false advertising or violated consumer protection statutes.</p>
<p>NAR was dismissed from the case, as the court found that there was not enough evidence to show a conspiracy between NAR and the portals. Then, in a recent jury decision, the court found in favor of all remaining defendants.</p>
<p><strong>MLS Property Information Network (PINS) Litigation</strong></p>
<p>In this case, NAR was not a defendant. In the case, the plaintiff asserted that MLS PINS, the largest MLS in New England, required listing brokers to offer a blanket, unilateral offer of compensation to buyer brokers in order to submit a listing.</p>
<p>MLS PINS agreed to settle the matter but did not admit any wrongdoing. As a part of the settlement, they agreed to pay the plaintiffs $3 million in the settlement and overhaul their listing policy, including, removing the requirement that listings must offer cooperating compensation, and that listing brokers are to notify sellers that they’re not required to offer compensation to buyer brokers and that they can decline if a buyer broker requests compensation; and they will clarify that if the seller makes an offer to a buyer broker and the buyer makes a counteroffer, then any commission to be paid is negotiated among the seller, the buyer, the seller broker and the buyer broker.</p>
<p>Recently, the Department of Justice intervened in this settlement to question its “competitive impact.” As a result, the court has provided a two-month extension of time to the deadlines related to the settlement.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Justice Matter</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, the Department of Justice began an inquiry into NAR’s Participation Rule and Clear Cooperation policy. The parties came to a settled agreement in that matter. However, thereafter, the DOJ attempted to back out of the agreement and they sought to reinvestigate the same issues again. NAR filed a petition in court to compel the agreement and the court held that the DOJ must abide by the agreement and shut down the new probe.</p>
<p>As a part of that prior agreement, NAR moved forward with the terms of the settlement in good faith, including increased transparency for consumers by enabling brokerages to make offers of compensation public on their websites, and by amending the Code of Ethics to include that representation is not “free” or available at no cost to their clients, unless the Realtor will receive no financial compensation from any source.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As we come in for a landing, you can see that the real estate landscape is quite rocky. As things continue to develop, continue to check out my monthly articles. It’s far better reading than the Skymall magazine in the seat back compartment; although I always wanted to buy one of the upside-down tomato plants.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The 75-member Culture Transformation Commission is made up of both members and association staff. The CTC will hold its first meeting Oct. 19.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><strong>By Stacey Moncrieff</strong></p>
<p>CHICAGO—The National Association of Realtors announced on Tuesday  (Oct. 10) the appointment of a new commission aimed at developing recommendations for changing NAR’s culture. The 75-member Culture Transformation Commission is made up of both members and association staff. The CTC will hold its first meeting Oct. 19.</p>
<p>Formation of the CTC comes in the wake of news reports, including an Aug. 23 story in The New York Times, alleging that NAR did not act swiftly or adequately enough to counter incidents of harassment, intimidation and retaliation by its leaders. The Times report led to the resignation of 2023 President Kenny Parcell. President-elect Tracy Kasper ascended to the presidency two months before the scheduled start of her term and vowed to staff and members that NAR would act quickly.</p>
<p>In a memo to NAR staff on Tuesday, NAR CEO Bob Goldberg said commission members were selected from a large group of volunteers by the CTC Appointment Task Force, which was established by NAR’s Executive Committee. “The Appointment Task Force was mindful about choosing individuals with different experiences and perspectives,” Goldberg said, including representatives from affinity trade groups and NAR’s Institutes, Societies, and Councils.</p>
<p>NAR staff members named to the CTC were nominated and elected by their colleagues. Among the group are some of the most vocal critics of how the association responded to staff complaints lodged in 2022. “We utilized a comprehensive process to ensure this group is representative of the broad viewpoints at NAR,” Goldberg said.</p>
<p>The CTC includes 33 NAR members, 25 NAR staff members and 17 local and state Realtor association staff. Shaun Harper, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California will lead the commission.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>Any transformation of the culture at NAR must include an examination of the power held by NAR’s Leadership Team, Kasper said in a meeting with staff in September.</p>
<p>Harper is employing surveys, interviews with executives and focus groups, and he will facilitate a town hall–style forum at NAR NXT in November. The CTC will analyze the ideas and perspectives gleaned from these interactions and present recommendations to NAR’s leadership in 2024.</p>
<p>“While this work will take time, we’re taking a focused and deliberate approach, guided by an external expert, to ensure we’re considering the best ways forward to help NAR to emerge a stronger, more cohesive organization,” Goldberg said in his memo to staff. Kasper posted the same message to NAR’s Board of Directors on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p><strong>What Came Before</strong></p>
<p>Even before appointment of the CTC, changes at NAR were underway.</p>
<p>In November 2021, the Board of Directors and Delegate Body approved nine recommendations coming out of the Governance Game Changer Presidential Advisory Group, led by NAR Past President Sharon Millett of Maine and Terrie Suit, CEO of Virginia Realtors. The changes included expansion of the Executive Committee’s size and power, more specific duties for regional vice presidents and changes to the composition of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Following the complaints in 2022, NAR undertook a number of steps, including the development of a Leadership Pledge. The pledge outlines the behavior expected of NAR leaders, as well as disciplinary actions that could be taken if leaders fell short of their commitments. In addition, NAR created protocols regarding member behavior at events and now requires all attendees to accept the terms. “We have since expelled members from events for inappropriate behavior,” Goldberg said in a separate memo to staff.</p>
<p>NAR also mandated enhanced harassment prevention training for volunteer leaders.</p>
<p>“We are now working to take additional actions, led by outside experts, to promote a safe and supportive environment for everyone,” Goldberg said. In addition to the CTC, he added, “we have established a new policies and procedures task force, a new special committee to address claims of member misconduct and new processes for employee complaints.”</p>
<p>Kasper wrapped up her message to board members by reiterating her commitment to action. “Many thanks to each of our commissioners for their leadership and to all of you for your dedication to NAR,” she said. “We will continue to provide updates. Our intention is to be attentive to concerns, responsive to feedback and transparent in our communications.”</p>
<p><strong>The Commissioners</strong></p>
<p>Members of the CTC were notified of their selection on Sept. 30 and will hold their first meeting this month. They are expected to submit recommendations to NAR leadership in 2024.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The newly enacted amendments to the act will take effect on March 20, 2024. The original PCDSA (“2002 PCDSA”) went into effect on March 1, 2002.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Sept. 22, 2023, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed critical legislation amending Sections 262, 265 and 267 of New York’s Real Property Law (“RPL”) known as the Property Condition Disclosure Statement Act (PCDSA) [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/3FeUEem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3FeUEem</a>]. The newly enacted amendments to the act will take effect on March 20, 2024. The original PCDSA (“2002 PCDSA”) went into effect on March 1, 2002.</p>
<p><strong>The Newly Enacted Amendments of the PCDSA</strong></p>
<p><em>The Removal of the $500 “Opt-Out” Credit</em></p>
<p>One significant change to the act is the elimination of the provision, which provided that if a seller of a one-to-four family residential real property did not deliver a completed Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) to a purchaser prior to entering into contract, the seller would be required to provide the purchaser with a $500 credit at closing. This is a significant change in real estate transactions, particularly in downstate New York where almost no seller ever provides the PCDS.</p>
<p>Section 465 of the RPL was also amended. The title of Section 465 was changed from “Remedy” to “Liability,” and the identical language referred to above relating to the $500-credit was deleted entirely and replaced with the following: “Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as limiting any existing legal cause of action or remedy at law, in statute or in equity.” It is important to note that the preceding language was the same language contained in Section 467 (which is being deleted and moved to Section 465 with this newly enacted amendment). Again, this change is notable because there is no longer a reference to a “remedy” (i.e., the $500 credit) that was available to a purchaser for a seller’s failure to provide the PCDS.</p>
<p>The shifting of the definition of “liability” in itself does not seem to have a significant effect on the state of a seller’s potential liability under the new amended PCDSA. The PCDS, with the deletion of the $500-credit language, now simply provides that if a seller “…makes a knowingly false or incomplete statement on [the] form [it] may subject the seller to claims by the buyer prior to or after the transfer of title.” Existing case law and prior judicial interpretations relating to the PCDSA would still be applicable and will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p><em>Additional PCDS Questions Added Relating to Flood Issues</em></p>
<p>Other notable changes to the PCDS include the revision of question 10 to include specific reference to whether the real property is in a “Federal Emergency Management (FEMA)” designated floodplain and the addition of questions 11 through 18, and question 39. All of the other questions have remained basically the same. These added questions relate specifically to whether the residential real property is located on “100-year floodplains” or “500-year floodplains.” The questions also ask whether the property is subject to any federal flood insurance requirements or subject to federal flood requirements, whether the seller has received any flood assistance from FEMA or other governmental agencies, whether the property is covered by flood insurance and whether there are FEMA elevation certificates available for the property.</p>
<p>Questions 14, 17 and 39 are significant additions to the new PCDA. Question 14 requires the seller to disclose if the seller “ever” received assistance from FEMA, the SBA or other governmental agencies. Question 17 requests the seller to disclose whether the seller “ever filed a claim for flood damage to the property….” Additionally, the seller is now required to disclose under question 39 whether the structure has “…experienced any water penetration or damage due to seepage or a natural flood event.” It is important to note that the only question related to the existence of water damage was question 27, which asked the question as follows: “Is there any rot or water damage to the structure or structures?” Basically, allowing a seller to answer “no” to the question if there was damage or rot as long as the seller remedied the issue which is what occurred in the <em>Kazmark</em> case discussed below. The addition of the above questions now requires the seller to provide any historical information relating to the property.</p>
<p><strong>An Agent’s Duty Under Section 466</strong></p>
<p>While Section 466 of the RPL was not modified, it is important to review the duties of a real estate licensee in connection with the PCDS. Section 466 provides as follows:</p>
<p>An agent representing a seller of residential real property as a listing broker shall have the duty to timely inform each seller represented by that agent of the seller&#8217;s obligations under this article. An agent representing a buyer of residential real property, or, if the buyer is not represented by an agent, the agent representing a seller of residential real property and dealing with a prospective buyer, shall have the duty to timely (in any event, before the buyer signs a binding contract of sale) inform such buyer of the buyer&#8217;s rights and obligations under this article.</p>
<p>As long as the agents fulfill their obligations with respect to Section 466 “the agent shall have no further duties under this article and shall not be liable to any party for a violation of this article. When the 2002 PCDSA went into effect NYSAR created general broker/agent disclosure confirmation forms for optional use by real estate licensees so that they could document that they delivered the PCDS to the seller and that they informed buyers of their rights and obligations under the PCDSA.</p>
<p><em>Malach v. Chuang</em>:</p>
<p><strong>The First Decision in 2002 on the Original PCDSA</strong></p>
<p>The first court decision interpreting the 2002 PCDSA was issued by Judge Philip S. Stranieri in 2002 in <em>Malach v. Chuang</em> [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3PSgvNr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3PSgvNr</a>]. This decision is still cited and relied on by courts in New York. Judge Straniere’s decision was openly critical of the legislature for creating an act which, in his opinion, was vague, unenforceable in part, difficult to interpret and which did not achieve the principal objectives sought, namely protection of the purchaser. He noted that the “legislation must be re-examined and re-drafted so that it can achieve its stated purpose of consumer protection.” The judge provided an analysis of the then newly0enacted law (which is helpful to revisit) based upon four specific issues: (1) whether the PCDSA provided a buyer with a specific cause of action separate from what is already available to a buyer under common law; (2) what are the specific remedies, if any, provided under the law; (3) whether disclosures made in the PCDS survive the contract or a closing and (4) the effect of an answer of “unknown” provided by the seller in the PCDS.</p>
<p>Regarding the causes of action available under the PCDSA, Judge Straniere concluded that the PCDSA did not establish a separate cause of action available to a purchaser and that only the existing common law causes such as active concealment or fraudulent misrepresentation were available.</p>
<p>Similarly, with regard to remedies, Judge Straniere concluded that other than the specific remedy relating to the $500 credit, there were no other clear remedies provided in the PCDSA, except for the vague reference to any remedies available at law or in equity, and in his opinion, there were “serious” issues with it.</p>
<p>The court also held that the disclosures made in the PCDS would not survive the contract or closing, provided that the customary “as is” language and “merger clause” are included in the contract. Judge Straniere also pointed out that since the PCDS was annexed to the contract, as required by the act, the purchaser had no cause of action based upon the disclosures made in the PCDS because they “merge into the contract of sale and into the deed at closing.”</p>
<p>Lastly, regarding the effect of an answer of “unknown” provided by the seller in responses to questions contained in the PCDS, Judge Straniere noted that the manner in which the law was written places an undue burden upon purchasers because any answer, which reflects “unknown” shifts the burden to the purchaser to make inquiry about that particular item. Judge Straniere explained that “a prudent purchaser having been informed of seller&#8217;s lack of knowledge should either hire a structural engineer to inspect all of the ‘unknowns’, or take some other steps to acquire the knowledge necessary to make an intelligent decision regarding the condition of the premises.”</p>
<p><strong>The Early Opinion in <em>Malach </em>as to the </strong><strong>Benefits of Not Providing the PCDS</strong></p>
<p>The court in <em>Malach</em> also noted that it may make sense for a seller not to complete the PCDS at all and simply provide the purchaser with a $500-credit. Judge Straniere explained that “completion of the Disclosure provides a document that can be used against the seller in a suit under a common law theory such as one alleging fraud or negligent misrepresentation. The Disclosure is certified by the seller giving it certain evidentiary value. By completing the Disclosure, the seller may be giving the purchaser an advantage in subsequent litigation.” It soon became the custom, mainly in downstate New York, for seller’s attorneys to recommend to their seller-clients not to complete or deliver the PCDS and simply opt to provide the purchaser with the $500-credit. However, in upstate New York many sellers do provide the PCDS and as a result there exists more case law on the PCDSA in those areas.</p>
<p><em>Kazmark v. Waslyn</em>: <strong>A False Statement in the PCDS </strong><strong>May Constitute Active Concealment</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Kazmark v. Waslyn</em> [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3FaKLOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3FaKLOD</a>] (a 2018 Third Department Appellate Division decision), the plaintiffs sued the sellers “for breach of contract, fraud/intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and violation of Real Property Law § 465(2) stemming from allegations that defendant knew or should have known about the material defects that he denied existed or that he listed as unknown in the PCDS.” The court in <em>Kazmark</em> citing various decisions, explained that if a seller makes a false statement in the PCDS it could constitute active concealment.</p>
<p>However, the court went on to state that since the PCDS requires only that a seller make a disclosure based on the seller’s actual knowledge, the buyer is required to prove “that the seller had actual knowledge of a condition that was misrepresented by the disclosure contained in the PCDS.” Additionally, the buyer must prove “…that [the] defendant knowingly misrepresented a material fact upon which [the] plaintiff justifiably relied, causing [the plaintiff&#8217;s] damages,” in order for the buyer to be successful in a cause of action for fraud or intentional misrepresentation.</p>
<p>In <em>Kazmark</em>, the seller testified “that, although he was aware of standing water in the basement before 2006, he answered no to the question on that topic because he had corrected the problem and, to his knowledge, there were no such issues when he completed the form in 2008.” Since question 20 on the current PCDS (27 on the new form) asks whether there “is water damage or rot” at the time the seller completed the PCDS, it was not misleading or dishonest for the seller to answer “no” to that question. The revised PCDS, particularly question 39, now requires the seller to disclose if there was “any water penetration or damage” relating to the property and would have likely required the seller to provide a different response.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do We Stand Now?</strong></p>
<p>The newly amended Act will certainly require sellers to complete and deliver the new PCDS to purchasers starting March 20, 2024. It will require real estate licensees to be sure to review and comply with the requirements of Section 466. It is critical for licensees to strongly recommend to their buyer and seller clients early on to discuss the ramifications and requirements of the PCDSA with their attorneys. Sellers should be referred to their attorney and instructed not to complete the PCDS until they have conferred with counsel.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it will require attorneys, particularly those practicing in downstate New York, to review existing case law, the entire act and the PCDS very carefully. They must be sure to advise their clients and stress the importance of answering all of the questions honestly and explain to their seller-clients what the term “actual” knowledge means in the context of completing the PCDS. Attorneys representing sellers must also be sure to include the necessary “as is” merger, and non-survival provisions in their contracts and riders.</p>
<p>Section 462(1) specifically provides that “nothing contained in this article or this disclosure statement is intended to prevent the parties to a contract of sale from entering into agreements of any kind or nature with respect to the physical condition of the property to be sold, including, but not limited to, agreements for the sale of real property ‘as is.’” Therefore, attorneys will need to sharpen and refine existing contract language to protect sellers to the furthest extent possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, the purchaser’s attorney will need to explain now, more than ever, that simply because the seller is providing a PCDS and disclosing certain information relating to the condition of the property, the purchaser must conduct all of the necessary and required inspections. In fact, the PCDS expressly provides that it “IS NOT A WARRANTY OF ANY KIND BY THE SELLER” and “IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INSPECTIONS OR TESTS.” The newly amended PCDSA will certainly change the landscape of real estate transactions in the coming years but how exactly is yet to be seen. All that can be done now is to be prepared.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><em>Editor’s Note: The following is the full text version of the <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Q3-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 THIRD QUARTER REAL ESTATE SALES REPORT </a></em><em>Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx counties, New York released recently by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>
<p>WHITE PLAINS—The combination of high interest rates and low inventory dampened buyer demand and were the chief causes in significant declines in sales transactions during the third quarter of 2023 throughout the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR) market area, which includes Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx counties.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Q3-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Third Quarter Real Estate Sales Report</a>, based on data provided by OneKey MLS, HGAR states that the median sale price of a single-family home increased modestly in all of its market areas, with the exception of the Bronx, which posted a small decline in sales price. Overall, for-sale residential inventory was down in all markets, with Sullivan County registering the smallest decline in inventory.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-46015" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3rd-Quarter-2023-Median-Sale-Price-Single-Family-homes.png" alt="" width="800" height="439" /></p>
<p>Realtors are hopeful that with expected lower interest rates in 2024, more homeowners will be prompted to put their homes on the market for sale in the early part of next year, propping up inventory and purchase options for prospective homebuyers.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, overall residential sales, as compared to the third quarter of 2022, fell 20.8% in Westchester County; 33.8% in Putnam County; 22.6% in Orange County; 25.3% in Rockland County; 26% in Sullivan County and 23.7% in The Bronx. Year-to-date through Sept. 30, 2023, overall sales have fallen sharply in all markets as compared to a healthier market through the first three quarters of 2022—Westchester sales were down 25.9%; Putnam sales were down 28.8%; Orange County’s overall sales numbers declined 25.8%; Rockland County sales were down 27.3% Sullivan County sales have fallen 28.1% and home sales have declined 22.2% in The Bronx.</p>
<p>While home prices have stabilized in some sections of the United States, the lack of inventory continues to put upward pressure on prices in the HGAR market area. The median sale price of a single-family home in the third quarter increased 6.3% to $925,000 in Westchester County; 1% in Putnam County to $510,000; 7.1% in Orange County to $450,000; 4.5% in Rockland County to $690,000 and 7.3% in Sullivan County to $299,500. The median sale price of a single-family home in the Bronx fell 2.8% in the third quarter to $612,500.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-46017 aligncenter" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3rd-Quarter-2023-Median-Sale-Price-SFHs.png" alt="" width="800" height="551" /></p>
<p>The prolonged high interest rate environment has kept many possible home sellers on the sidelines. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at 7.67% for the week ended Oct. 6, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association—the highest level since 2000 and 40 basis points higher than a month ago. Inventory levels in every market took a turn for the worse, posting overall residential declines (year-to-date) of: 31.8% in Westchester; 26.9% in Putnam; 18.6% in Orange; 26.9% in Rockland; 6.4% in Sullivan and 26.1% in The Bronx.</p>
<p>HGAR members report that despite the slowdown in demand, there continues to be intense competition among buyers in all price categories, particularly for homes that are accurately priced.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Area Realtors believe that the current sales environment will continue until the Federal Reserve Board provides more clarity on its interest rate strategy in battling inflation going forward.</p>
<p>National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun, during his exclusive Oct. 10 visit to the HGAR offices in White Plains, noted that the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders recently sent a joint letter to the Federal Reserve requesting a pause in any further interest rate increases for a few months to see if the inflation rate will fall even further in reaction to past interest rate increases.</p>
<p>Yun predicts that come the spring of 2024, lending rates will be in the mid 6% area.</p>
<p>Later, in reaction to a mostly positive inflation report issued on Oct. 12, Yun stated, “Consumer prices are not fully compliant, though they have decelerated from last year. In September, inflation rose at 3.7%, the same as in the prior month but slower than 8.2% a year ago. The Federal Reserve’s goal of raising the interest rates has been to bring inflation to near 2%. We are not quite there yet, partly because gasoline prices have been moving up for four straight months, now up 3% from a year ago and up 68% from pre-COVID days. Despite many private sector data pointing towards softer rent growth, the official government measurement is still showing a fast increase. Rents rose 7.4% from a year ago. This is the main reason why consumer prices are not fully under control and why the Fed refuses to consider cutting interest rates. It is nonetheless inevitable for rent growth to slow because of the construction of multiple new apartments. Inflation and interest rates will be lower next year.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>I don’t know about you, but it seems like I have heard the phrase “once in a lifetime storm” about 18 times between Superstorm Sandy and the July storms that recently flooded the Hudson Valley. So, either time has sped up or that phrase has lost all its meaning. Regardless, we live in a time where flooding, forest fires and storms are affecting almost every industry.</p>
<p>In some areas, major insurers are no longer providing coverage to whole states. In New York State, we are dealing with the climate reality both in the increase of actual storms and the government’s response to those increases in storms. In recent years, Albany has had a dynamic response to climate change, and often those responses intersect with our industry. Here are some examples of how those responses have affected our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Many of you are aware of the ban on telemarketing during a state of emergency. HGAR and NYSAR have worked hard to get the law lifted. We managed to get a law passed in the New York State Assembly and are still fighting the Senate to gain passage of the proposal. What you might not be aware of is that this law’s origins came from a response to a storm. In 2018, the Hudson Valley was hit with back-to-back snowstorms. In an attempt to help the situation, a bill was created to ban telemarketing calls during states of emergencies so individuals can focus on getting a call from the power company. This well-intentioned law unfortunately had unintended consequences now that we live under two to three states of emergency at any given time—and, all the while, it does not seem to have done anything about the number of calls I receive about my car’s warranty. But worry not, for with your help, this legislative session we can put enough pressure on the Senate to pass our bill to correct this law.</p>
<p>More recently, New York State has made some major changes to new building requirements. The coming requirements prohibit the installation of fossil fuel equipment and building systems—a new term defined in the law—and are phased in by building height. The prohibition starts in 2026 for new buildings up to seven stories tall, except for commercial and industrial buildings larger than 100,000 square feet. In 2029, new buildings of all sizes must be built without fossil fuel equipment. While home builders, especially multi-unit developers, have struggled to build the adequate amount of housing under the current development climate, a number of fast-approaching incremental environmentally-friendly requirements are not likely to speed up home production.</p>
<p>Even more recently on Sept. 22, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a bill that will help consumers make more informed choices when purchasing a home in New York as it relates to property flood status and experience. In detail, this will be done by adding seven questions to the Property Condition Disclosure Statement. This new law does not change the role or responsibility of Realtors regarding the PCDS but it does add a level of bureaucracy that each Realtor needs to be aware of. The law does not take effect until March 20, 2024. Between now and then, NYSAR plans on issuing further guidance on exactly how this law will be implemented.</p>
<p>The frequency of storms and the government’s response to those storms will often intersect with the real estate industry and home ownership. As homeowners and home providers, this is not an issue that we can ignore. Both well-intentioned and prudent policies will most likely add a new level of vigilance and reality to becoming a successful Realtor. As we navigate this together, we will keep you posted on the clouds on the horizon.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[At the event, held at the Castle Hill YMCA, commercial and residential real estate practitioners, borough and state political leaders, as well as HGAR leadership participated in a wide-ranging program that highlighted the heightened investment and opportunities that exist in the Bronx as it recovers]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors held its second annual “Bronx County Day” recently that was attended by more than 100 Realtor members and staff, as well as a host of politicians representing the borough, including Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson.</p>
<p>At the event, held at the Castle Hill YMCA, commercial and residential real estate practitioners, borough and state political leaders, as well as HGAR leadership participated in a wide-ranging program that highlighted the heightened investment and opportunities that exist in the Bronx as it recovers from the devastation brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the afternoon’s program offerings was Bronx Borough President Gibson’s upbeat view on the future of the Bronx, noting a host of beneficial initiatives that will fuel economic growth in the Bronx, including improvements at Orchard Beach, the new Hip-Hop Museum and the four new Metro-North stations in the east Bronx (Hunts Point, Morris Park, Co-op City, and Parkchester/Van Nest) as part of the Penn Access project by the MTA. In total, she noted that there is approximately $2.7 billion in investment earmarked for the Bronx in the coming years.</p>
<p>Speaking directly to the HGAR attendees, Gibson said, “I appreciate the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. I appreciate all of you, whether you are a Realtor, a property manager or a landlord, you are invested in this borough by the jobs you create, the taxes you pay, stimulating the economy with the businesses that you support. That is a part of the renaissance of this borough.”</p>
<p>She noted that while there is much more work to be done, Gibson said, “The forecast and the picture of the Bronx is bright and we want to shine bright with jobs and opportunities with access to investment, with partnerships and collaboration and most importantly seeing the promise and the potential of our borough. I know I can speak for my colleagues that we are no longer going to be first in everything bad and last in everything good.”</p>

<p>The program began with presentations by Eliezer “Eli” Rodriguez, Esq., Regional Government Affairs Director for HGAR/Director, Bronx Chapter of HGAR; Pedro Barry, President of the Board of Managers for the Castle Hill YMCA; Tony D’Anzica, President of HGAR; Lynda Fernandez, HGAR Chief Executive Officer and HGAR Chief Strategy Officer Gary Connolly, who highlighted some of the major initiatives and programs undertaken by the association and its subsidiary OneKey MLS in 2023.</p>
<p>Among the speakers at Bronx County Day was Rob Walsh, president of the Bronx Economic Development Corp., who discussed a host of projects that have broken ground or are in the pipeline that will bring new housing, commercial space and jobs to the borough.</p>
<p>Walsh noted that Brookfield Properties’ The Third at Bankside mixed-use project is one of the largest private investment endeavors in the Bronx at $950 million. Bankside will consist of two parcels on each side of the Third Avenue Bridge in the Mott Haven section and will involve seven tower buildings totaling 1.4 million square feet of space that will also include 15,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
<p>He also noted that construction has topped out on the first phase of Bronx Point, a 22-story mixed-use building at 575 Exterior St. in the South Bronx. The project will produce 542 units of permanently affordable housing units, along with 56,000 square feet of community space and 12,000 square feet of retail space. The property will be the home of the Universal Hip Hop Museum. The building is the first to be developed as part of the $349-million mixed-use master plan that will eventually feature 1,045 apartments and nearly three acres of public green space.</p>
<p>Other significant development projects include Fordham Landing, a 2.5-million mixed-use community that will include 2,380 apartments (720 deemed affordable) located on approximately 30 acres. The ambitious proposal calls for 800,000 square feet for a life sciences center, a hotel, waterfront bars and restaurants, an e-sports center and 15,000 square feet of retail space. The project also envisions the construction of a 350,000-square-foot community facility building.</p>
<p>Another exciting development in the borough is The Peninsula, a dramatic re-imagining of the former Spofford Juvenile Detention Facility into a mixed-use campus and a light industrial building home to small start-up and growing manufacturing businesses, featuring a health and wellness center, fresh food grocer, affordable housing for the Hunts Point neighborhood, and a live-work community for the South Bronx tech and creative sectors.</p>
<p>Key facets of The Peninsula will include: 740 units of 100% affordable housing, 52,000 square feet of publicly accessible open space, including a new plaza, 50,000 square feet of light industrial space, 53,500 square feet of community facility space and 15,000 square feet of commercial space.</p>
<p>Gilbane Development Company, Hudson Companies, and MHANY Management have secured $297 million to complete phase two of The Peninsula. The next phase includes two new affordable housing buildings, known as 2A and 2B that will yield 359 apartments. This phase will also create a 50,000-square-foot plaza, a 155-vehicle parking garage, and a 20,000-square-foot community facility space. The majority of the apartments will be designated for individuals and households at or below 60% area median income.</p>
<p>In his informative presentation, Walsh also noted a number of economic and investment opportunities, including the recent release of the Request for Proposals for the Kingsbridge Armory. The proposal includes a combined $200-million investment by New York State and New York City in the future redevelopment of the storied armory.</p>
<p>The program also featured an insightful Commercial Real Estate Panel moderated by MacKenzie Forsberg, HGAR CID Vice Chair, and Kathy Zamechansky, Owner and President of KZA Realty Group, Inc. The panelists were: Lisa Sorin, President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce; Anthony Mormile, Senior Commercial Loan Officer at Orange Bank &amp; Trust Co.; David Simone, President Concourse Realty Partners, and Raphael Rogers, Executive Director at Business Initiative Corporation (BIC) of New York.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[on-residential development continues to lead construction spending, totaling $34.9 billion in 2023. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The New York Building Congress released its “2023-2025 New York City Construction Outlook Report” on Oct. 18 where it projects that total construction spending in New York City will reach $83 billion in 2023, up $13 billion from last year, adjusting for inflation. The updated spending figure is projected to reach $261 billion over a three-year period and is about 18% higher than pre-pandemic spending.</p>
<p>The report stated, “Spending in inflation-adjusted dollars is expected to reach $261 billion ($285 billion, in nominal dollars) over a three-year period, growing to $88 billion in 2024 and then to $89 billion in 2025. Compared to the pre-pandemic, three-year period from 2017 to 2019, this reflects an inflation-adjusted increase of $40 billion. Although high interest rates on construction starts and property mortgages are expected to somewhat depress property values through reduced demand, escalating material and labor costs, as well as ongoing supply chain issues, have significantly contributed to increased building costs and are not likely to deflate with more development.”</p>
<p>“Construction spending has always served as an indicator of a region’s economic health, and we’re proud to report continued growth and resilience, high levels of employment and billions of dollars in economic outputs across New York City,” said Carlo A. Scissura, President and CEO of the NY Building Congress.</p>
<p>He added, “Notably, residential construction has declined citywide due to the expiration of 421-a, high interest rates and outdated bureaucratic red tape. The Building Congress calls for policies to support housing production at all levels of affordability to combat our housing shortage and ensure New York is a functional and affordable place for all New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>Non-residential development continues to lead construction spending, totaling $34.9 billion in 2023. In 2023, 6.65 million square feet of new office space will be completed. New office construction is expected to decline by a million square feet each year through 2025. Non-residential construction will likely be driven by manufacturing and educational projects and laboratories in New York City over the next several years, the report stated.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, government spending on infrastructure development is projected to dominate the market. In 2023, government construction spending will reach $22 billion, up from $20 billion in 2022. While funding decisions are still being made at the federal level for competitive grants from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), formula funding is expected to reach New York City much more rapidly, according to the report.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to invest $30 billion within the five boroughs over the next three years, a 47% increase over pre-pandemic total spending between 2017 and 2019. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is expected to invest $1.8 billion in New York City capital projects in 2023, slightly down from almost $2 billion in 2022. An additional $1.6 billion in public works spending will be undertaken by various state and federal agencies in 2023, the New York Building Congress stated.</p>
<p>One of the few negatives for the construction industry in New York City was the impact of the 421a tax incentive’s expiration on new multifamily building projects. Residential development and rehabilitation accounts for 32% of construction spending in 2023, down from 37% in the previous year. Due to the expiration of 421-a, combined with high interest rates and significant bureaucratic hurdles, property owners and investors are expected to prioritize spending on maintaining, renovating, and upgrading existing residential properties over building new ones over the next few years, according to the report.</p>
<p>Another bright spot for the city’s construction sector is the fact that its workforce is almost back to pre-pandemic levels. The report noted that construction employment in 2023 is behind its pre-pandemic levels by 5%. However, the building industry is set to grow by almost 19,000 new jobs within three years. The Building Congress anticipates employment in the construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering, and specialty trades to total 153,000 jobs in 2023, 160,000 in 2024 and 162,000 in 2025, when the industry is expected to finally bounce back to pre-pandemic employment levels.</p>
<p>In response to the NY Building Congress’ positive forecast, two prominent construction industry executives also pointed out the industry’s resilience during the COVID pandemic and its promising future.</p>
<p>“While the commercial real estate development and construction industries in New York City are facing significant headwinds due to the economic climate, we remain bullish about the long-term growth and success of our industry,” said Ralph J. Esposito, Chair of the New York Building Congress and President of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Region at Suffolk. “The federal government’s heavy investment in infrastructure, along with resilient sectors such as healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, data centers and transportation, will continue to create opportunities to develop and build incredible projects that will transform our city skyline and improve the quality of life for our citizens.”</p>
<p>Gary LaBarbera, President of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, added, “If New York is to maintain its economic revival and set a solid foundation for our future generations, it is critical that we continue to fund development and construction projects that generate thousands of good paying, family sustaining career opportunities for working class New Yorkers. The trends shown in this year’s Construction Outlook Report are certainly promising, but continued investment, paired with policy efforts that address shortcomings in areas such as housing, are necessary so that we may meaningfully uplift our communities and provide more of our tradesmen and tradeswomen the opportunity to pursue an honorable, fulfilling, and secure path to the middle class.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales faded in September, the National Association of Realtors announced today. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales rose in the Northeast but receded in the Midwest, South and West. All four regions registered year-over-year sales declines.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—waned 2.0% from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million in September. Year-over-year, sales dropped 15.4% (down from 4.68 million in September 2022).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“As has been the case throughout this year, limited inventory and low housing affordability continue to hamper home sales,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The Federal Reserve simply cannot keep raising interest rates in light of softening inflation and weakening job gains.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Total housing inventory registered at the end of September was 1.13 million units, up 2.7% from August but down 8.1% from one year ago (1.23 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.4-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.3 months in August and 3.2 months in September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The median existing-home price for all housing types in September was $394,300, an increase of 2.8% from September 2022 ($383,500). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“For the third straight month, home prices are up from a year ago, confirming the pressing need for more housing supply,” Yun said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Realors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 21 days in September, up from 20 days in August and 19 days in September 2022. Sixty-nine percent of homes sold in September were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">First-time buyers were responsible for 27% of sales in September, down from 29% in August 2023 and September 2022. NAR’s 2022 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released in November 2022—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 26%, the lowest since NAR began tracking the data.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All-cash sales accounted for 29% of transactions in September, up from 27% in August and 22% in September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 18% of homes in September, up from 16% in August and 15% one year ago.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales – represented 1% of sales in September, unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.57% as of October 12. That’s up from 7.49% the previous week and 6.92% one year ago.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> </strong>Single-family home sales slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.53 million in September, down 1.9% from 3.6 million in August and 15.8% from the prior year. The median existing single-family home price was $399,200 in September, up 2.5% from September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Existing condominium and co-op sales recorded a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 430,000 units in September, down 2.3% from August and 12.2% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $353,800 in September, up 6.8% from the prior year ($331,300).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Existing-home sales in the Northeast rose 4.2% from August to an annual rate of 500,000 in September, down 16.7% from September 2022. The median price in the Northeast was $439,900, up 5.2% from the prior year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The Northeast posted the strongest price gain resulting from higher demand coupled with inventory falling by 20%,” Yun said. “The West experienced softer price growth reflecting a pause after years of unsustainable and rapid price increases, especially in the Rocky Mountain region.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the Midwest, existing-home sales declined by 4.1% from the previous month to an annual rate of 930,000 in September, down 18.4% from one year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $293,300, up 4.7% from September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Existing-home sales in the South dipped 1.1% from August to an annual rate of 1.82 million in September, a decrease of 11.7% from the previous year. The median price in the South was $360,500, up 3.1% from September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the West, existing-home sales trailed off 5.3% from the previous month to an annual rate of 710,000 in September, down 19.3% from one year ago. The median price in the West was $606,100, up 1.8% from September 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>WHITE PLAINS—While Realtors say that home buying demand is still strong, high interest rates and critically low inventory caused residential sale transactions to fall precipitously in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>According to the recently released “<strong><a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Q3-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-Report.pdf"><em>2023 THIRD QUARTER REAL ESTATE SALES REPORT: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx counties, New York</em></a></strong>” by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, overall residential sales, as compared to the third quarter of 2022, fell 20.8% in Westchester County; 33.8% in Putnam County; 22.6% in Orange County; 25.3% in Rockland County; 26% in Sullivan County and 23.7% in The Bronx.</p>
<p>Year-to-date through Sept. 30, 2023, overall sales have fallen sharply in all markets as compared to a healthier market through the first three quarters of 2022—Westchester sales were down 25.9%; Putnam sales were down 28.8%; Orange County’s overall sales numbers declined 25.8%; Rockland County sales were down 27.3% Sullivan County sales have fallen 28.1% and home sales have declined 22.2% in The Bronx.</p>
<p>While home prices have stabilized in some sections of the United States, the lack of inventory continues to put upward pressure on prices in the HGAR market area. The median sale price of a single-family home in the third quarter increased 6.3% to $925,000 in Westchester County; 1% in Putnam County to $510,000; 7.1% in Orange County to $450,000; 4.5% in Rockland County to $690,000 and 7.3% in Sullivan County to $299,500. The median sale price of a single-family home in the Bronx fell 2.8% in the third quarter to $612,500.</p>
<p>For-sale inventory is down sharply in five of the six HGAR market areas, with Sullivan County the only market to post less than double-digit percentage declines as compared to a year ago.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-46015" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3rd-Quarter-2023-Median-Sale-Price-Single-Family-homes.png" alt="" width="800" height="439" />Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors President Tony D’Anzica said the recently released third quarter statistics for the HGAR region continue to reflect a troubling weakness in the real estate market. “Third quarter closed sales in the Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam counties all dropped precipitously by about 25% compared to the second quarter. With 30-year mortgage rates recently peaking around 8%, their highest level in over 20 years, mortgage demand falling to the lowest level since 1996, and median sales prices continuing to increase every quarter, buyers are facing the toughest market in decades,” he said.</p>
<p>D’Anzica, who is Broker-Owner of DynaMax Realty NYC, Inc., also pointed to another troubling sign for the market as the National Association of Realtors’ Housing Affordability Index has continued to decline this year causing housing affordability to reach one of its lowest levels in nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the record low housing inventory and high interest rates are both driving this market downturn. Few, if any, reasonable policies are being implemented (or even discussed) at any political level to address these issues,” he added.</p>
<p>HGAR President-elect Carmen Bauman, Principal Broker of Green Grass Real Estate of Bronxville, said that the current residential real estate marketplace is dominated by high demand and high pricing. Bauman, who is also an Associate Broker with commercial real estate firm RM Friedland, noted in a recent webinar presented by Orange Bank & Trust Co., “Consumers’ challenges are further complicated by record level interest rates. Commercial real estate is more complex: multifamily remains strong, hospitality is on the cusp of a rebound, the industrial warehouse sector has growth largely driven by the prevalence of e-commerce during the pandemic—while the inverse became true for traditional retail—and office space remains in flux as almost all companies, large and small, are reconsidering their needs.”</p>
<p>Bauman related that during the height of the COVID pandemic, the region saw a “temporary exodus,” by some residents but since then many of those individuals have returned to the area, including a number who have decided to rent in new high-rise rental apartment buildings in Westchester County. She said that the multifamily rental market is ‘booming” and many of these new developments are currently enjoying high absorption rates. She said in the coming months and years it will be interesting to see if the multifamily market can maintain the high absorption rates as new product comes on line in the county’s major cities.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence in its third quarter residential report stated that the region is experiencing intense buyer competition in most price categories, despite the prevailing market headwinds. In fact, the brokerage firm contended that homes spent the lowest amount of time on the market in years, which it attributed to “ready, willing, and able buyers and a large percentage of cash purchases.”</p>
<p>“In certain markets, the number of top-price tier listings is beginning to increase, affording more variety for buyers. While the demand might suggest otherwise, buyers remain discerning. Accurate pricing remains critical as overly inflated prices can cause homes to be overlooked and seller disappointment,” said Houlihan Lawrence President and CEO Liz Nunan.</p>
<p>Nunan added, “We anticipate buyer demand to continue with our markets offering so much, from housing to recreation, culture, and more. It remains an opportune time to sell north of New York City.”</p>
<p>Leah Caro, President and Principal Broker of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville advised her fellow Realtors that it may be time to stop complaining and start thinking about employing alternate strategies during this trying market.</p>
<p>“As buyers continue to fight for the ‘good stuff’ in multiple offer scenarios, at above list price, it might be time to reset their expectations. Buyers who are currently renting, and looking for that perfect ‘forever” home,’ should consider a spring-board purchase like a co-op or condo,” Caro said. “Buying a more cost-effective home, with more choice in inventory than the single-family market, will still give them the opportunity to earn equity for the next purchase and will likely cost them less every month than the highest-rents-ever they may be paying now.”</p>
<p>Caro related that sellers who believe the current high interest rates are deterring some buyers from putting in an offer on their home might consider offering owner financing and should seek advice from their lawyer or tax accountant to see if that would be feasible.</p>
<p>“Buyers interested in the 2-4 multi-family markets will definitely benefit from the new 5% down financing options, and they should examine this with their mortgage professional. Any extra income earned from the other units in the house could help offset the interest rates,” Caro noted.</p>
<p>Finally, she said that buyers’ agents should search for listings that have been on the market for 90 days to see if any deal could be struck.</p>
<p>“Agents can’t control the interest rates, the inventory, or the global economies but they can use innovative strategies to help buyers buy, and get transactions moving,” Caro stressed.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The governor signed S. 4709A/A. 7758, which authorizes New York City to adopt a new affordable housing rehabilitation program to replace the former J-51 program.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed several bills into law on Oct. 23 geared at building and preserving more affordable, energy-efficient housing in New York City.</p>
<p>The governor signed S. 4709A/A. 7758, which authorizes New York City to adopt a new affordable housing rehabilitation program to replace the former J-51 program.</p>
<p>The governor also signed Legislation S. 2985C/A.6655A establishes the “Housing Affordability, Resiliency, and Energy Efficiency Investment Act of 2023,” giving New York City more flexibility to provide loans and grants for affordable housing and other related investments. These can include climate resiliency improvements to help ensure the sustainability of affordable housing. Hochul also put her signature on Legislation A. 7359/S. 6750, which increases the New York City Housing Development Corporation&#8217;s bonding capacity.</p>
<p>“In light of New York’s housing crisis, I am proud to sign this legislation, which will allow for the construction and preservation of more affordable, sustainable, and sorely needed housing in New York City,” Gov. Hochul said. “I am committed to increasing the housing supply to address our housing shortage, and I will continue to work with the Legislature on solutions to ensure that all New Yorkers have a safe, stable, and affordable place to call home.”</p>
<p>S.4709A/A.7758 enables New York City to replace the former J-51 program, which expired on June 29, 2022. The legislation allows New York City to provide tax abatement benefits for eligible construction projects to preserve and improve certain affordable rental and homeownership buildings. In doing so, the legislation will help to retain and improve the quality of the city&#8217;s existing affordable housing supply, which is critical to supporting low- and moderate-income families and ensuring the city and state do not lose ground as they seek to add much needed housing, state officials noted.</p>
<p>S.2985C/A.6655A establishes the Housing Affordability, Resiliency, and Energy Efficiency Investment Act of 2023, giving New York City more flexibility to provide loans and grants for affordable housing and other related investments.</p>
<p>The legislation modernizes existing financing laws that support the construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation of affordable housing and helps to ensure that these programs can also support resiliency and energy efficiency upgrades in line with the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. The legislation also allows the city to use municipal funds to provide down payment assistance to prospective homebuyers. By giving the city more flexibility to provide loans and grants, this legislation will help to create and preserve more affordable housing, expand homeownership opportunities for more New Yorkers, and support the State’s climate resiliency and energy efficiency goals.</p>
<p>Legislation A.7359/S.6750 increases the bonding capacity for the New York City Housing Development Corporation, the nation’s largest municipal housing finance agency and one of the nation’s top issuers of affordable multifamily housing bonds, to $19 billion. Without an increase, HDC is expected to run out of bonding capacity by mid-2024. By increasing the availability of municipal housing bonds, this legislation will support the creation and preservation of more affordable housing in New York City, as well as support critical investments in public housing.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Mayor Adams praised the governor for signing the bills. “As rents continue to rise and working people struggle to afford to stay in New York, our administration is moving aggressively to make the changes we can at the city level to build much-needed housing,” Mayor Adams said. “But our partners in government increasingly understand the need for bold action to address the city’s affordability crisis. I want to thank Governor Hochul, Senator Kavanagh, Assemblymember Rosenthal, and all of our legislative partners for helping to get these bills passed and signed into law today. We are looking forward to continued partnerships across the five boroughs and the state to deliver critical resources and policy changes so New York can continue to work for working people.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[New York Blood Center will occupy the entire property for office space, testing and research laboratories, and processing storage and distribution of blood and associated supplies. The preliminary approval was granted at the LDC’s meeting on Friday, Oct. 20.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County’s Local Development Corporation announced on Oct. 24 it had voted preliminary approval of $52 million in tax-exempt bond financing for the $108-million redevelopment of the former Avon headquarters in Rye into a 187,000-square-foot facility to be leased to the New York Blood Center Inc.</p>
<p>New York Blood Center will occupy the entire property for office space, testing and research laboratories, and processing storage and distribution of blood and associated supplies. The preliminary approval was granted at the LDC’s meeting on Friday, Oct. 20.</p>
<p>“The adaptive reuse of a vacant headquarters building into modern offices and lab space is another example of the continued strength and vitality of Westchester’s economy. We welcome New York Blood Center to our County’s dynamic health care sector,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.</p>
<p>“The LDC is pleased to vote preliminary approval of tax-exempt bond financing to one of the largest community-based, non-profit blood collection and distribution organizations in the nation. This important project will generate significant fiscal benefits for the County while creating hundreds of construction and full-time jobs,” said LDC Chair Joan McDonald.</p>
<p>Located at 601 Midland Ave., the property is undergoing complete rehabilitation. Improvements include all new HVAC, electrical systems and switchgear, new windows, roof, plumbing upgrades, repairs and improvements to the building façade, landscaping, new paving, the construction of clinical and research laboratories, exterior lighting among other improvements. All improvements will meet or exceed current energy and environmental requirements. The $108-million project is estimated to take 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>The project is estimated to create $9,958,855 in total fiscal benefits comprised of $141,767 in sales tax revenue from construction earnings, $9,717,088 in sales tax revenue from on-site employees spending over 30 years and $281,250 in fees to be collected by the LDC based on bond sale proceeds. The project is also projected to create 124 construction jobs and 686 jobs from on-site operations.</p>
<p>Serving New York since 1964, New York Blood Center Inc. is one of the largest independent, community-based blood centers in the world. The former Avon offices and data center facility has been vacant for approximately four years. The building is located on 14.8 acres.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Real estate is a driving economic force in New York State, and politics and policy can have a significant impact on the industry. The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. and OneKey MLS hosted an Oct. 12 virtual panel that featured experts who surveyed New York’s political landscape, looked at laws and regulations, and shared intel on what real estate professionals need to know to support the industry.</p>
<p>“The New York State Association of Realtors does an incredible job of getting in front of the legislators, particularly in Albany with their Lobby Day,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, the regional multiple listing service that covers nearly a dozen counties in the greater NYC area from Manhattan, to Suffolk, Westchester and Sullivan. “Also, our state and local organizations have done calls to action and connected our members to legislators representing them in their districts,” Haggerty said “It’s very effective.”</p>
<p>Haggerty recalled that, during his time as CEO of HGAR, “We’d have all the legislators come in one room of the capitol building, coordinated by Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins. It was really powerful to see 100 people filling up that room. We had an organized agenda on state and local issues, which made an impact with the legislators.”</p>
<p>Haggerty hosted “The Importance of Politics and Policy in New York Real Estate,” a virtual forum featuring Heather Domi, founding chair of the New York Residential Agent Continuum (NYRAC) and associate real estate broker at Compass; Jonathan Greenspun, managing director of Mercury Public Affairs; and Mike Kelly, director of government affairs for the New York State Association of Realtors. The event was moderated by Brian D. Tormey, NTP, president of TitleVest, a leading NYC-based provider of title insurance and related real estate services.</p>
<p>The webinar was part of the “Be Your Best” series created by HGAR and OneKey MLS, to help Realtors and agents navigate a changing landscape.</p>
<p>The panel agreed on the importance for real estate professionals to know their local lawmakers and the issues, and to advocate for policies beneficial to the industry.</p>
<p>“A lot of agents in our city are passionate about politics in our industry,” said Domi, who founded NYRAC in 2018 as a group of civic-minded agents to advocate for the industry. “The reality is, most people don’t take action because they rely on somebody else, such as the real estate boards, to do it. When individual constituents start contacting their local lawmakers, in large numbers, they move the needle and people listen. It’s very impactful and allows us to have a voice in what is happening in our industry. Our voice matters.”</p>
<p>Greenspun of Mercury, a public strategy firm, urged those in the real estate industry to get more politically involved. “The politics of real estate changed drastically circa 2018, when the Republicans no longer controlled the state Senate,” said Greenspun. “For years, real estate prospered … but with the election of AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY 14) and some very far left-wing members of the state legislature, that turned the politics in Albany on its head.</p>
<p>“The message for everyone tuning in today, and to convey to your colleagues, is get involved. It matters. The survival of your industry is dependent upon it,” Greenspun added.</p>
<p>The panel pointed to laws and issues impacting the industry, including:</p>
<p>• Class-action lawsuits against the National Association of Realtors and other entities over commissions;</p>
<p>• Brooklyn City Councilman Chi Ossé’s bill to require landlords who hire a broker to pay the broker’s fees, as opposed to the renter automatically being responsible;</p>
<p>• Good Cause legislation, which seeks to limit how a landlord can evict a tenant; and</p>
<p>• The expiration of 421-A, which offered a real estate tax exemption for new housing construction.</p>
<p>“It is critical for you to get involved politically and make your voice heard,” said Kelly, of the New York State Association of Realtors. “A working practitioner or a Realtor brings a voice to the issues that I talk to lawmakers about all the time. They have the expertise to talk to their lawmakers about why they like a bill or why they have concerns about a piece of legislation. I represent the industry, I have a good knowledge of the issues but I’m not working with buyers and sellers, or renters and property owners.”</p>
<p>NYSAR’s Kelly ticked off races to watch in New York for 2024, including the 18th Congressional District, where Republican Alison Esposito is seeking to oust Democrat Pat Ryan. He also pointed to Republican-held House seats in New York’s 1st, 3rd, 4th, 17th, 19th and 22nd districts that the Democrats are hoping to flip in 2024.</p>
<p>“As I look toward these 2024 elections, there’s an opportunity for us to weigh in,” Kelly said. “My ask, at least of our own members is, I’m not going to tell you who to vote for, but you need to vote. Lawmakers need to know that real estate votes—that’s really important.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—New York City officials, Vornado Realty Trust, developers Hudson Pacific Properties and Blackstone were joined by community leaders to break ground on Oct. 24 on Sunset Pier 94 Studios—a first-of-its-kind film and TV campus now under construction on Manhattan’s West Side.</p>
<p>Leveraging $350 million in private investment, the project is expected to create more than 1,700 jobs, including more than 1,300 construction jobs, add $6.4 billion to the local economy over the next 30 years, as well as adding new public restrooms, significant public space and bike safety improvements, and a new workforce development program to connect New Yorkers. The start of construction represents major progress on a site sitting vacant, where efforts to advance a project creating jobs and public open space have stalled for more than a decade, city officials noted.</p>
<p>“New York City didn’t set an all-time jobs record by accident—we did it by strategically protecting public safety, investing in public space, and supporting and delivering for working people. This project at Pier 94 will do all three, and we are excited to bring our ‘Working People’s Tour’ to the West Side,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “Sunset Pier 94 Studios will bring a major private investment to this public asset, activating this long-vacant space to create good-paying jobs, vibrant public space, and exactly the amenities this community has been asking for.”</p>
<p>“It was only a few months ago that we announced this exciting new public-private partnership that’s going to bring jobs and a huge economic boon to the film and television industry here in New York City, and we are already breaking ground,” said NYCEDC President and CEO Kimball. “This is a huge milestone for the city and all our partners, and we are looking forward to cutting the ribbon on Manhattan’s first film, television, and content production facility, along with the significant improvements to the public realm and waterfront access on the West Side of Manhattan.”</p>
<p>Sunset Pier 94 Studios will be a first-of-its-kind space, home to state-of-the-art film, television, and content production technology that will make New York City even more competitive with other cities. Sunset Pier 94 will also provide impressive amenities for all New Yorkers to enjoy, including new public restrooms for Hudson River Park, an 1,850-square-foot community amenity space, 25,000 square feet of waterfront open space on the pier, and safety improvements to the existing greenway. There will also be a program to support workforce development and training programs to connect residents to opportunities in film, television, commercial and other media production.</p>
<p>The project represents a total investment of approximately $350 million from Vornado, Hudson Pacific, and Blackstone. The project construction will utilize $183 million in construction financing led by RBC with expected completion by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>“The swift commencement of construction on Sunset Pier 94 Studios is representative of the strength of this public-private partnership and the demand we anticipate for the first purpose-built studio facility in Manhattan,” said Victor Coleman, chairman and CEO, Hudson Pacific Properties. “We know the local entertainment industry is hungry for a modern, ideally located production facility and we look forward to delivering and operating this unique project to meet those needs.”</p>
<p>“Today, alongside our partners, we celebrate breaking ground at Sunset Pier 94 Studios, which will further cement New York City as a leading market in content creation,” said Nadeem Meghji, head of real estate Americas, Blackstone. “We look forward to the productions this project will enable, the jobs it will create, and the benefit it will have on the surrounding area — a win-win-win.”</p>
<p>“Sunset Pier 94 Studios is a tremendous project for New York City that will generate new jobs, while further beautifying the Hudson River waterfront,” said Michael Franco, president and chief financial officer, Vornado Realty Trust. “Our collective willingness and ability to move forward despite the challenging financial markets is a testament to our confidence in the promise of creating such a dynamic new product in Manhattan.”</p>
<p>New York City’s film and TV industry has grown significantly over the last decade, supporting 185,000 jobs, generating over $18 billion in wages, and contributing more than $82 billion in economic impact. After struggling during the pandemic, the city’s arts and entertainment sector continues to show positive momentum in its jobs recovery—growing nearly 16% between May 2022 and May 2023 and recovering nearly 46,000 jobs since the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Global Business Council of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors has received the prestigious 2023 Platinum Global Achievement Award from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Global Business Council, which was formed in 2018, received a Platinum Award last year and earned a Gold Global Achievement Award in 2020 and 2021 and a Silver designation in 2019. In 2021, HGAR was awarded the Ambassador Association of the Year Award by NAR for its focused efforts in creating new and innovative programming benefiting both US and Portuguese Realtors.</p>
<div id="attachment_46160" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46160" class="wp-image-46160 size-medium" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/394575571_10226903470667565_7873298080424048909_n-250x250.jpg?_t=1698264328" alt="" width="250" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-46160" class="wp-caption-text">The 2023 NAR Global Achievement Program has announced the  Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors  has been awarded PLATINUM.</p></div>
<p>HGAR President and Global Council Co-Chair Tony D’Anzica said of this year’s achievement award: “Thanks to our expanded global initiatives and programming, HGAR has been able to engage more deeply with so many of our members, new and old. Our members are learning that being exposed to global strategies and partnerships broadens their knowledge, creates referral opportunities, elevates professionalism, and expands business networks across our entire region, as well as nationally and internationally—all of which helps our members succeed and thrive both locally and globally.”</p>
<p>He added, “I am very proud of our Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Global Business Council. This incredible honor from NAR recognizes all of the effort and hard work that goes into building relationships around the world and creating exceptional and innovative programming.” He cited the efforts of HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez, Staff Liaison Cathleen Stack, along with Global Business Council Co-Chair Christina Prostano, in growing the council’s influence and reach both in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>The Global Achievement Program is designed to recognize and reward the most active associations in global business. Among the more than 130 global business councils nationwide, each of these organizations has demonstrated the utmost commitment to helping members capture their share of the global real estate market in the United States, in addition to connecting their council and members to the global community in their local area.</p>
<p>Participating councils are divided into four status classifications based on their level of activity: Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond. A council need not meet every criterion listed for a given status level if the size or demographics of its parent association do not warrant or allow it to do so. Those councils achieving each status classification are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and announced by the National Association of Realtors Engagement Team. A council&#8217;s status year begins at NAR&#8217;s Realtors Conference &amp; Expo. Councils are evaluated in five focus areas: Business Plan, Marketing &amp; Communication, Events/Education, Outreach, and Benchmarking.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Stack noted that NAR also evaluated HGAR’s activities, such as the Ambassador Association with Portugal, so HGAR would like to give credit to its partners from Portugal International Realty (PIR) and APEMIP in Portugal for its achievement award. HGAR’s Global Council will receive its Platinum Global Achievement Award on Wednesday, Nov. 15 at a ceremony at the Anaheim (CA) Marriott Hotel</p>
<p>The HGAR Global Council staged the 17th Annual Global Real Estate Summit at the Fordham University Law School in New York City on Oct. 18-19. The event was a huge success that drew real estate professionals from 13 states, three countries, and HGAR’s Portugal Trade Mission guests. The two-day event offered valuable insights into the latest market data, trends, resources, and tips to jump start or grow global business and better understand global cultures.</p>
<p>A total of 10 associations, including HGAR, co-hosted the event that featured dynamic speakers, Economic Development and Commercial/Global Real Estate panels and moderators, event guests and Fordham University Real Estate Institute officials. The 2023 event included a pre-summit property tour at 3Eleven NYC and two Certified International Property Specialist (CIPS) hosted networking events.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of other HGAR’s Global Council’s activities in 2023 include:</p>
<p>• HGAR sent a delegation to the MIPIM conference in Cannes, France in March 2023. MIPIM is an annual four-day conference attracting thousands of real estate and related professionals throughout the globe and offering hundreds of exhibitors and events. HGAR was an exhibitor in the NAR USA Pavilion, representing the New York Region.</p>
<p>• HGAR President D’Anzica and Immediate Past President Anthony Domathoti represented HGAR at three Global conferences in Western Europe. On June 28th they attended the Western European Leadership Summit hosted by the National Association of Realtors.

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales rose 1.1% in September, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Northeast, Midwest and South posted monthly gains in transactions while the West experienced a loss. All four U.S. regions had year-over-year declines in transactions.</p>
<p>“Despite the slight gain, pending contracts remain at historically low levels due to the highest mortgage rates in 20 years,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. “Furthermore, inventory remains tight, which hinders sales but keeps home prices elevated.”</p>
<p>The Pending Home Sales Index rose 1.1% to 72.6 in September. Year-over-year, pending transactions declined 11%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p>
<p>NAR forecasts that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will average 6.9% for 2023 and decrease to an average of 6.3% in 2024, while the unemployment rate will lower to 3.7% in 2023 before increasing to 4.1% in 2024.</p>
<p>NAR predicts existing-home sales will decrease 17.5% in 2023, settling at 4.15 million, before rising 13.5%, to 4.71 million in 2024. Compared to last year, national median existing-home prices are projected to remain stable in 2023—edging higher by 0.1% to $386,700, before increasing by 0.7% next year, to $389,500. Housing starts will drop 10.4% from 2022 to 2023, to 1.39 million, before rising to 1.48 million, or 6.5%, in 2024.</p>
<p>“Because of homebuilders’ ability to create more inventory, new-home sales could be higher this year despite increasing mortgage rates. This underscores the importance of increased inventory in helping to get the overall housing market moving,” said Yun.</p>
<p>NAR expects newly constructed home sales will grow from last year by 4.5% in 2023, to 670,000—because of additional inventory in this market segment—and increase by another 19.4% in 2024, to 800,000. The national median new home price will drop by 5.9% this year, to $430,800, and improve by 3.5% next year, to $445,800.</p>
<p><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>The Northeast PHSI increased 0.8% from last month to 63.1, a loss of 12.7% from September 2022. The Midwest index expanded 4.1% to 74.3 in September, down 9.2% from one year ago. The South PHSI rose 0.7% to 87.1 in September, retreating 10.7% from the prior year. The West index declined 1.8% in September to 55.3, dropping 12.9% from September 2022.</p>
<p>“Sales are expected to turn positive by early next year, with affordable regions and fast job-creating markets in better positions to recover, led by the Midwest and South,” added Yun.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[According to the 49-page report, the disparities and higher fees cost Black and Latino borrowers more than $200 million over the course of their mortgages.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—New York Attorney General Letitia James released a scathing report earlier today on what she termed as a “stark racial gap” in homeownership rates and access to home financing across New York State.</p>
<p>These disparities are a significant contributor to the racial wealth gap and result in higher housing costs for homebuyers of color, making it harder for communities of color to build lasting financial security and overcome decades of systemic discrimination in the housing market, the report stated. According to the 49-page report, the disparities and higher fees cost Black and Latino borrowers more than $200 million over the course of their mortgages.</p>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General&#8217;s report found that homeownership in New York is concentrated in white households and neighborhoods. This trend of lower homeownership rates for people of color is present throughout the state. The report noted that the City of Albany has the second-largest gap between white and Black homeownership of any city nationwide, second only to Minneapolis. Across New York, white households are 25% more likely than Asian households to own their home and more than twice as likely as Black or Latino households to own their home.</p>
<p>“Owning a home is an essential part of achieving the American dream and building wealth to pass on to future generations,” said Attorney General James. “Unfortunately, unequal access to affordable credit is still pervasive across our state, reinforcing the legacy of segregation, leading to a disparity in homeownership, and fueling the racial wealth gap. This report makes it clear that our state must do more to provide better resources for homebuyers and strengthen housing laws to help empower more New Yorkers. My office remains committed to fighting housing discrimination in all forms, and I look forward to working with my partners in government to address this problem.”</p>
<p>The report also reveals the significant barriers that borrowers of color face when attempting to purchase a home. Not only are Black and Latino New Yorkers disproportionately underrepresented among mortgage applicants, all applicants of color are denied mortgages at higher rates than white applicants, regardless of credit score, income, size of the loan, and other factors. Even among borrowers with the highest credit scores, non-white mortgage applicants are denied a mortgage at nearly double the rate of white applicants.</p>
<p>Some of the key findings of the report include:</p>
<p>• Lower homeownership rates for people of color were present in every single region in the state.</p>
<p>The report showed that white households in New York are more than twice as likely as Black or Latino households to own their home. Among white households, 67% own their homes, compared to only 34% of households of color according to the Census’s American Community Survey (ACS) based on 2020 data. Homeownership rates were particularly low among Black households (32%) and Latino households (27%).</p>
<p>• Black and Latino people are underrepresented among those who apply for purchase mortgages</p>
<p>• Lenders received disproportionately fewer applications for home purchase loans in 2021 from Black and Latino applicants: Statewide, 7.6% of purchase applications were from Black residents and 9.5% were from Latino residents, approximately half of each group’s representation in the overall state population.</p>
<p>• People of color who apply for loans for purchase mortgages were more likely to be denied.</p>
<p>• Applicants of color in New York are denied home purchase mortgages at higher rates than are white applicants.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-46185 aligncenter" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mail.png" alt="" width="800" height="497" /></p>
<p>“This is true even when controlling for credit score, income, size of loan, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and year of application. When controlling for these factors, the probability of a Black or Asian applicant’s purchase application being rejected in 2021 remained 43% higher than for a white applicant; Latino applicants were 33% more likely to be rejected than a white applicant,” the report stated.</p>
<p>• When borrowers of color are approved for purchase mortgage loans, they are charged more interest, costs, and fees.</p>
<p>The report stated that Black and Latino borrowers received more-expensive loans as compared to white and Asian borrowers. On average, Black and Latino borrowers were charged more than $4,200 more in interest-rate payments over the course of the loans and an additional $900 in other costs and fees. For purchase loans originating between 2018 and 2021, across all loans with terms of 30, 25, 20, 15, or 10 years, Black and Latino borrowers faced an estimated $200 million more in interest and other costs and fees over the course of their loans as compared to white and Asian borrowers.</p>
<p>Asian borrowers were more likely than white borrowers to have higher average costs and fees across loan types.</p>
<p>The report also indicated that there are racial disparities that exist for people of color when refinancing their homes. For example, applicants of color have a 21% greater probability of having their refinancing loan applications denied compared to white applicants with the same application characteristics.</p>
<p>In addition, the report stated that refinancing with historically low interest rates during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic was unequal, with 16,000 fewer applications from neighborhoods of color as compared to white neighborhoods. This resulted in a loss of an estimated $44 million in annualized savings for neighborhoods of color across the state.</p>
<p>The report charged that “A deep legacy of racism and disadvantage has harmed neighborhoods of color, and non-depository lenders have not solved the problem. These disparities exist not only between individual applicants and borrowers of different races, but are also present across neighborhoods: Black and Latino neighborhoods have fewer applications, higher rates of denial, and costlier loans.</p>
<p>New private-sector, non-depository lenders have not solved these challenges. They show similar disparities in rates of applications and denials, as well as costlier fees, the report stated.</p>
<p>“These disparities are not new. They are both persistent and rooted in historic discrimination. Public policy has thus far failed to address these issues; in fact, public policy has at times created or exacerbated them. Moreover, while discrimination by individual lenders explains some of these disparities, the problems reflect systemic failures that will require structural reforms,” the Attorney General’s report stated.</p>
<p>Among some of the housing advocacy organizations that commented on the report’s findings included said Ronald Rosado Abad, CEO of Community Housing Innovations, who said, “It is disheartening to read New York Attorney General Letitia James’ report detailing that hard working, credit worthy, savings-minded Black and Latino New Yorkers remain less likely to own a home, more likely to be denied mortgages, and charged higher interest rates for a loan. Homeownership is the basis for wealth creation and upward mobility. Community Housing Innovations, a major nonprofit leader in the affordable housing and homeownership industry in New York, supports and advocates for increased access to homeownership financing for all New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>“We thank Attorney General James and her team for doing this work and sharing it with us,” said Tanya Dwyer, Legal Services of the Hudson Valley. “The numbers in this report reflect the disparities and effects of systemic discrimination that we see in our work with clients. As a Homeowner Protection Program Network member, we will continue to fight alongside the Attorney General’s Office to protect homeowners from such discrimination.”</p>
<p>The report identified a number of state-level policy solutions that could help close the racial homeownership gap, such as subsidizing down payments and interest rates for first-generation home buyers, who are disproportionately people of color, to make it easier for families who have never bought a home to get credit.</p>
<p>Other recommendations include increasing state funding to nonprofit financial institutions that can better support communities of color underserved by traditional financial institutions and passing the New York Public Banking Act to create a regulatory framework for cities, towns, and regions to establish public banks. These institutions would help expand access to affordable financial services in underserved communities.</p>
<p>The report also calls for increasing resources for government agencies&#8217; fair lending investigations and strengthening New York’s Human Rights Law to expressly prohibit lending practices that have a disparate impact on communities of color, as well as exploring options for state-provided banking services at places like libraries and post offices to help reduce the population of New Yorkers who lack adequate access to traditional banking services.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[During the 11-day trial, NAR presented the facts and law about pro-consumer, pro-competition MLS rules, which class-action attorneys called into question. The case covers the Missouri markets of Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield and Columbia.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>KANSAS CITY, MO—The National Association of Realtors and two codefendants were found liable Tuesday (Oct. 31) in the federal Sitzer/Burnett trial, which challenged MLS rules and the real estate compensation model. The eight-person jury also found liable HomeServices of America and Keller Williams Realty, which were named in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>During the 11-day trial, NAR presented the facts and law about pro-consumer, pro-competition MLS rules, which class-action attorneys called into question. The case covers the Missouri markets of Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield and Columbia.</p>
<p>“NAR rules prioritize consumers, support market-driven pricing and promote business competition,” the association said in a statement. “This matter is not close to being final, as we will appeal the jury’s verdict.”</p>
<p>In presenting their case, plaintiffs argued buyer representation is obsolete and should only be afforded to wealthy buyers who can pay for the services out of pocket. They also alleged commission rates are too high, buyer brokers are being paid too much and NAR rules, along with the corporate defendants’ practices, lead to fixed pricing.</p>
<p>NAR countered that consumers are better off and business competition is able to thrive because of MLS rules and how well local broker marketplaces function. NAR’s cooperative compensation rule ensures efficient, transparent and equitable local broker marketplaces. Sellers can sell their home for more and have their home seen by more buyers, while buyers have more choices of homes and can afford representation. NAR also argued that Realtors are everyday working Americans who are experts at helping consumers navigate the complexities of home purchases, as well as advocating for fair housing and wealth-building for all.</p>
<p>NAR plans to appeal the jury’s verdict, but that process could take years to resolve. NAR says it remains committed to pro-consumer, pro-competition practices and is confident the association will ultimately prevail.</p>
<p>Key points that emerged throughout the trial:</p>
<p><strong>About NAR</strong></p>
<p>• The very reason NAR exists as a trade association is because there was a need, identified more than 100 years ago, for a higher level of ethical practice in real estate.</p>
<p>• NAR rules are made as part of a public rulemaking process and are consistently shared and made available publicly.</p>
<p>• NAR does not seek, track, receive or set commissions for buyers’ or sellers’ agents.</p>
<p>• NAR is an advocate and resource in the real estate market for its members and their clients, and only NAR members can call themselves Realtors.</p>
<p>• NAR membership includes robust benefits, such as exclusive access to health, home and auto insurance. NAR offers business and marketing services, as well as extensive opportunities for learning through designation and certification programs.</p>
<p><strong>About Realtor Value</strong></p>
<p>• Agents who are Realtors play a critical role in guiding consumers through all the legal, financial and community complexities of buying a home. They also make local broker marketplaces, which online housing portals tap into, possible because of all the information they input into those databases.</p>
<p>• Real estate agents are consumers’ advocates. They lead as entrepreneurs, experts and philanthropists to protect consumers, build generational wealth and contribute to local and national economies.</p>
<p>• Having a local expert manage the process is more important than ever. All of the sellers who testified in the case said they used an agent and were very satisfied with the services provided to them.</p>
<p><strong>About Broker Compensation</strong></p>
<p>• Agent compensation is set between brokers and their clients and has always been negotiable at any point in the transaction, as set forth in NAR’s publicly available guidance for members. And those costs are spelled out to buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>• If buyers had to pay out of pocket for representation, that would reduce the number of buyers and the money buyers have to purchase homes from sellers.</p>
<p>• Every plaintiff in this case knew the commission they were paying to their agent and agreed to it in writing.</p>
<p>• The cooperative compensation rule ensures both buyers and sellers are well represented and that the buyer broker knows what they will be paid before they commence work.</p>

<p><em><strong> Editor’s Note:</strong> Shortly after the verdict was announced, attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Sitzer/Burnett trial filed a new nationwide commissions lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors and brokerage firms Compass, eXp, Redfin, Howard Hanna Real Estate, United Real Estate, Douglas Elliman and Weichert, Realtors in U.S. District Court in Western Missouri. The plaintiffs in the new case are seeking class action status, according to multiple published reports. NAR President Tracy Kasper in a prepared statement, said, “We will appeal the liability finding because we stand by the fact that NAR rules serve the best interests of consumers, support market-driven pricing and advance business competition. We remain optimistic we will ultimately prevail. In the interim, we will ask the court to reduce the damages awarded by the jury ($1.78 billion).”</em></p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TARRYTOWN—Carmen Bauman, Principal Broker of Green Grass Real Estate of Bronxville and Associate Broker of commercial real estate brokerage firm RM Friedland, was named 2024 President of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors at the organization’s 107th Annual Member Appreciation Day held on Oct. 30 at the Westchester Marriott in Tarrytown. More than 1,000 HGAR members attended the day-long event.</p>
<p>Among the many highlights of the day-long program was Past President Anthony Domathoti being named 2023 HGAR Realtor of the Year. Domathoti is the Broker-Owner of EXIT Realty Premium of the Bronx. HGAR selected John Dolgetta, owner of Dolgetta Law, PLLC as its 2023 Affiliate of the Year. Dolgetta serves as HGAR (Outside) Legal Counsel. Also, 2023 HGAR President Tony D’Anzica provided a detailed review of the association’s activities and initiatives this year and announced he had selected HGAR Chief Marketing Officer Cathleen Stack as the 2023 President’s Award winner.</p>
<div id="attachment_46200" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46200" class="wp-image-46200" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JVP_1230.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p id="caption-attachment-46200" class="wp-caption-text">From left, 2023 Realtor of the Year Anthony Domathoti and Recognition Committee Co-Chair Crystal Hawkins-Syska</p>
<p> PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</p></div>
<p>President D’Anzica highlighted some of the major initiatives undertaken during his term of office, including a study of the association’s official newspaper <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. He reported that the <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> PAG (President’s Advisory Group) recommended and the HGAR Board recently approved the transition of the newspaper from print to digital. The last print edition of the newspaper will be published in December 2023. In January, a new <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> website will be launched. HGAR will continue to distribute the highly popular “Daily Update” and <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> digital weekly newsletter via email to all Members and Affiliates. In addition, a monthly e-mailed newsletter that will include top feature stories at Realestateindepth.com will also be distributed by email. He said the discontinuance of the print newspaper will reap HGAR print, graphics and mailing cost savings of more than $200,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>He also reported that work by another PAG on the possible repositioning of the Bronx HGAR building is nearing completion.</p>
<p>D’Anzica also discussed the association’s Global Business Council, which received the prestigious 2023 Platinum Global Achievement Award from the National Association of Realtors; the highly successful DEI Summit, the formation of the HGAR Sustainability Committee; the expansion of CID, the Young Professionals Network and the work of the association’s Strategic Planning Committee.</p>
<p>In a speech to the assembled membership, D’Anzica said that despite the headwinds facing the industry and the association going forward, “I am confident that our hard work has made our association much stronger, financially sounder, and well-positioned to weather any storm.”</p>
<p>He concluded his remarks by saying, “HGAR always needs to set the standard. Not just here at home in our region, but across the United States as one of the best associations in this country.”</p>
<p>President-Elect Bauman promised that in 2024 she plans on using the nearly 14,000 members to help advance the association’s initiatives. “I won’t be doing it alone,” Bauman said. She related that HGAR’s members are its most important asset and she plans on harnessing that “human capital” to help achieve the goals that the HGAR leadership and its members agree on for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez, who joined the association in September, spoke of the HGAR’s leadership and staff’s exceptional reputation both in the region and across the country. “I am so excited to have joined them and you and to be able to look to the future with positivity and strength. Your warm welcome and support have meant more to me than you will ever imagine,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_46199" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46199" class="wp-image-46199" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JVP_1213.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p id="caption-attachment-46199" class="wp-caption-text">From left, 2023 Affiliate of the Year John Dolgetta and Recognition Committee Co-Chair Crystal Hawkins-Syska</p>

<p>Fernandez also offered high praise for HGAR Chief Operating Officer Jana Currier for her leadership during the CEO search earlier this year while serving as Acting CEO and also for her work in securing $500,000 in NAR Realtor Relief Foundation grant funding for victims of the torrential rain storms in early July that hit the region. At the meeting, Fernandez said that HGAR had distributed approximately $250,000 to 147 families. The deadline for applying for grant funding was extended until Nov. 15, she reported.</p>
<p>After a quorum was recorded, HGAR officials presided over the election of Board members and reported the slate of 2024 HGAR Officers who will be voted on at the next HGAR Board of Directors meeting.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The leadership transition comes during a tumultuous time for NAR as it attempts to make reforms and pivot from a discrimination scandal at the association and a recent $1.78-billion verdict against NAR and several other brokerage firms in a commission lawsuit filed in Kansas City.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CHICAGO—The National Association of Realtors announced today that Nykia Wright has been appointed its interim Chief Executive Officer, starting November 20, 2023. Bob Goldberg, who announced his planned retirement in June of this year, will serve as an executive consultant to NAR to help support the transition. Goldberg has been with NAR for 30 years and has served as its CEO since August 2017.</p>
<p>As previously announced, NAR is conducting a comprehensive search process to identify a permanent CEO.</p>
<p>The leadership transition comes during a tumultuous time for NAR as it attempts to make reforms and pivot from a discrimination scandal at the association and a recent $1.78-billion verdict against NAR and several other brokerage firms in a commission lawsuit filed in Kansas City.</p>
<p>Wright brings a breadth of executive leadership and strategic advisory experience to NAR. As the CEO of the Chicago Sun-Times, she led the newspaper through a sweeping digital transformation and a merger with WBEZ (Chicago Public Media). She began her career in the financial services industry and, prior to leading the Sun-Times, was a strategy and business transformation consultant who advised companies and organizations on a variety of operational, financial and performance improvement matters.</p>
<p>Wright is also the co-founder of SonicMESSENGER, a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, startup helping democratize audience engagement and measurement by leveraging smart audio. She sits on the board of the American Cancer Society and the Better Government Association, among other entities, and is a member of the Dean’s Advisory Council at her alma mater, the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome Nykia as interim CEO,” said NAR President Tracy Kasper, a Realtor from Nampa, ID and broker-owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Silverhawk Realty. “Her deep experience driving organizational transformation positions her well to advance our strategy, vision and culture initiatives. I look forward to working with her, in partnership with our Leadership Team and staff, to continue strengthening our organization.</p>
<p>“We are immensely grateful for Bob’s leadership and decades-long service to NAR,” Kasper added. “It has been a privilege to work with him in expanding and strengthening our organization, and we congratulate him on his well-deserved retirement. His contributions to our association and our industry have been tremendous.”</p>
<p>Wright sits on the board of the American Cancer Society and the Better Government Association, among other entities, and is a member of the Dean’s Advisory Council at her alma mater, the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>“NAR advocates for and empowers people who help families across America realize the dream of homeownership,” Wright said. “I am honored to join the organization at this important moment, when the opportunity to make a difference in the evolving real estate landscape has never been greater. I look forward to getting to work and partnering closely with NAR’s talented staff in the months ahead.”</p>

<p>Goldberg also spoke to the transition. “After announcing my decision to retire earlier this year, and as I reflected on my 30 years at NAR, I determined last month that now is the right time for this extraordinary organization to look to the future.</p>
<p>“Nykia’s strategic expertise and forward-looking perspective are exactly what NAR needs to continue advancing its mission in an ever-changing world. I am grateful for the privilege of leading NAR and confident that the association will continue delivering incredible value to its members for generations to come.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—In light of some criticism being leveled against Industrial Development Agencies in New York State, particularly the need and financial returns of incentives granted to development projects by IDAs, a newly released report commissioned by The New York State Economic Development Council calculates the benefits of IDA incentives in 2021 in the billions of dollars and more than 1 million jobs retained or created.</p>
<p>Recently, New York State Senator James Skoufis, the Chairman of the New York State Senate Investigations and Government Operations Committee, has criticized Industrial Development Agencies particularly the Orange County Industrial Development Agency over some of the incentives it has awarded to development projects, charging that those incentives were not necessary. He also had a law passed that will have the Orange County IDA’s operations overseen by a state-appointed monitor.</p>
<p>On Oct. 30, The New York Economic Development Council released its report by Camoin Associates that found in 2021, IDAs helped create and retain 1.3 million jobs representing $141 billion in annual wages. Those wages helped generate $12.4 billion in annual New York State tax revenue.</p>
<p>The report calculated that for every dollar of taxes abated via IDA incentives, IDA projects generated $6.57 in new tax revenue for New York State. In addition, for every one dollar of exemptions issued, $74.89 in employee earnings was generated in the state and $237.46 in sales was generated in the state.</p>
<p>Also in 2021, IDA projects created $830 million in new tax revenue for local taxing jurisdictions including $338.9 million in payments to school districts across the state. This is new revenue to the schools that otherwise would not have occurred without IDA involvement. The total amount of school taxes abated by IDAs represents less than .5% of total school spending in 2021, the report stated.</p>
<p>The report calculated that active IDA-approved projects in the Mid-Hudson region in 2021 generated 80,308 direct jobs, 33,287 indirect jobs and another 49,793 induced jobs, bringing the 2021 jobs grand total to 163,388. The total earnings combining direct, indirect and induced earnings totaled $15.34 billion and IDA-induced projects in the region generated sales of approximately $55.63 billion.</p>
<p>The study reviewed the impacts of IDA projects specifically for the year 2021 as well as their broader economic impacts from 2018-2022. Data for this report was collected from the 2021 public authorities reporting information system (PARIS) overseen by the Office of State Comptroller, Lightcast, a global leader in labor market analytics, and survey data collected from 80 IDAS on housing and renewable energy.</p>
<p>“The sheer scale of the cumulative impact of IDAs on New York State’s economy is impressive,” said Rachel Selsky, Vice President at Camoin Associates. “The findings in the report demonstrate the positive outcome of the hard work done by these critical economic development organizations across the state in terms of jobs created, earnings generated, housing units developed, downtowns revitalized, renewable energy produced, and tax revenue generated.”</p>
<p>In terms of residential development projects, a total of 425 projects with a residential component have been approved statewide since 2018. The report stated that IDA projects were responsible for the construction of 39,625 new housing units—more than 10,000 of which were classified as affordable units.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-46224" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IDA-REPORT-GRAPHIC-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1649" /></p>
<p>Green projects also have secured benefits from IDA incentives. The report noted that since 2018, there have been 332 approved IDA projects statewide that include wind and solar infrastructure. These projects generate 4,809 megawatts of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The study was conducted over the past 10 months and provided a host of policy recommendations for the upcoming 2024 state budget and legislative session, including: formally authorizing IDAs to support the state’s housing goals, formally authorizing IDAs to support housing in accordance with the states housing goals; authorize IDAs to utilize their funds generated from fees to issue loans and grants to small businesses, and updating the Public Authorities Reporting Information System (PARIS) to ensure that the public has access to information about how these investments are performing.</p>
<p>The New York State Economic Development Council also calls for the reauthorization of $200 million in funding for the Fast New York Program to fund shovel-ready sites; reauthorization of $100 million for the RESTORE New York Program; reauthorization of $200 million for the DRI and the NY Forward Programs; the allocation $50 million for the prison redevelopment fund and the creation of a Master Plan Matching Grant Fund Program for municipalities (towns, cities, and counties) who want to update their master plan or the zoning plan. For any municipality that commits to increasing its housing stock by 5% over the next five years, the state would provide up to 50% of the matching funds needed to develop the master plan that will increase the community’s housing stock. Using this method, the state and locality are partners in the process, and the public will have the opportunity to partner with the state and their local elected leaders to determine where and how additional housing will be brought to their community.</p>
<p>A host of economic development and government officials across the state, including the Hudson Valley, praised the report’s findings and stressed the importance of IDAs in retaining and attracting business to New York.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Orange County Partnership, told Real Estate In-Depth, “Every state in the country is chasing jobs and new companies to land in their state. The fact that we have incentive programs in place to compete with other states is critical. These incentive programs are what we have to combat the high cost of living, the high taxes and the significant regulation that exist in New York. In fact, New York State has programs in place, such as Consolidated Funding Applications and other grant programs, to try and stay competitive. So, every one of these incentive programs are of critical importance if we are to stay competitive and keep people and workers in the State of New York.”</p>
<p>The Business Council of New York State President and CEO Heather Mulligan said upon the release of the report: “IDAs have long served an invaluable role in New York’s overall economic development efforts and in addressing key regional needs, and have promoted billions in private sector investments, including most recently on emerging priority issues including clean energy, affordable housing and the revitalization of our urban centers. Recent statutory amendments, developed with input from all stakeholders including IDAs and developers, are helping assure that IDA supported projects return significant economic benefits to the state and its municipalities. This study illustrates both the breadth and depth of the positive impacts achieved through IDA-supported investments.</p>
<p>Partnership for New York City President and CEO Kathryn Wylde said, “At a time when conventional project financing is expensive and difficult to secure, the role of IDAs is particularly important to sustain economic growth.”</p>
<p>The Business Council of Westchester President Marsha Gordon said, “I have seen firsthand the fact that IDAs in Westchester play a critical role in the growth of our economy. From Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to multi- residential housing across the county, IDAs remain the best local economic development tool to attract and retain private sector investment. This report not only highlights the broad economic impact of Westchester’s IDAs but highlights their important role in bringing much needed housing to our community. Without their support, these projects could not move forward.”</p>
<p>New Rochelle City Manager and IDA Board Chair Kathleen Gill said, “New Rochelle has undergone a tremendous transformation in the past few years as more than $2 billion in private sector investment has led to a revival of our urban core with more than 10,000 new homes authorized, and well underway. This transformation wouldn’t have been possible without the support of the city’s IDA and the tools it deploys. Thanks to our collective efforts, New Rochelle is among the fastest growing cities in New York State and has become a model community for creating new, high-quality housing that’s affordable.”</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The push by the real estate industry to bring transparency to the co-op transaction process, particularly by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors, was the subject of a recent<em> Realtor Magazine</em> article.</p>
<p>Realtors have had some successes in the fight for transparency.</p>
<p>When a New York State Association of Realtors member represented an openly gay city council member looking to purchase a co-op, the client brought an all-cash offer and retirement funds in excess of $150,000, But the co-op board rejected his application, giving no rationale. The decision left both the member and his client scratching their heads. Was there hidden bias because the buyer was gay?</p>
<p><strong>The Secret Life of Co-ops</strong></p>
<p>Discrimination is difficult to discern in any failed bid for a property, but when a co-op board is involved, the circumstances around a rejection are downright murky.</p>
<p>Cooperative housing, or co-ops, represent a different type of shared ownership arrangement than the more common condominium ownership, where buyers purchase the units they live in and an ownership interest in the building’s common areas. People living in a co-op own shares in the entire complex. Each owner receives a proprietary lease on a specific apartment and is obligated to pay a monthly maintenance charge that represents the proportionate share of operating expenses and debt service on the underlying mortgage, which is paid by the corporation. While the majority of co-ops are in New York, Washington, D.C., and California, they exist in other states, including Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin, Georgia and Florida.</p>
<p>Co-ops’ self-governing structure gives the owners the freedom to develop and maintain their environment and select who gains entry and who does not. While some co-op boards provide a reason for rejecting an applicant, many do not, nor are they required to in many places. Co-op boards are ostensibly looking to see who is going to be a “good neighbor,” which can be a pretext for bias or discrimination. In some pockets, a determined group of Realtors, members of the National Association of Realtors, is making headway toward greater transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Incremental Successes</strong></p>
<p>For close to two decades, Realtors have been on the front lines pushing for reforms that ensure fairness and transparency in co-op housing transactions.</p>
<p>“Buyers of co-ops pay an application fee, mortgage application fee and other costs that are not refundable if the buyer is rejected,” says Barry Kramer, SRES, principal broker-owner of Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate in Scarsdale. Kramer has been a key player in driving for greater transparency.</p>
<p>Reform proponents say the status quo—specifically, the length and scope of co-op applications, the review period, and the approval process—makes discrimination both easier to perpetrate and difficult to identify and prevent. They are fighting for uniform guidelines, as well as a requirement that co-op boards offer a reason for rejecting an applicant, to minimize the opportunity for discrimination.</p>
<p>In the greater New York City area, “the high cost of real estate makes co-ops a great entry into homeownership,” says Marlo Paventi, senior director of public policy and government affairs at the Long Island Board of Realtors. In addition to first-time buyers, seniors looking to downsize often explore co-op ownership, says Kramer, who served as 2018 president of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, which spans Manhattan, The Bronx, and Westchester (as well as Rockland, Orange and Putnam counties).</p>
<p>Mike Kelly, director of government affairs for NYSAR, says that after <em>Newsday</em> published “Long Island Divided” in 2019—a report detailing the results of fair housing testing on Long Island—he was certain there would be movement both statewide and in New York City on bills aimed at reforming the co-op sales and management process. And there have been efforts, he says. The New York City Council Bill Int. 915 would require co-ops to provide prospective purchasers with a written statement identifying each reason for denying the application within five days after the decision is made. A state bill, A02685, would amend New York’s Civil Rights Law §19-A to require cooperative housing corporations to provide a prospective purchaser with a written statement of reasons for a rejection. Despite Realtors’ efforts, these and other similar legislation have stalled.</p>
<p>Undeterred by the lack of movement, Realtors have successfully advocated for co-op transparency bills in five New York counties—Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Dutchess. The first of these victories came in 2009, in Suffolk County, when the county passed a Realtor-supported bill requiring co-op boards to make a decision, provide the purchaser with written notice of the decision, and, in the case of a denial, provide notice of the grounds for the rejection within 45 days after the receipt of an application.</p>
<p>With the support of Realtors, Westchester County passed legislation in 2018 and 2021 and Rockland County passed legislation in 2018 and 2022. Both counties now require co-op boards to disclose the minimum financial requirements to applicants before they apply. Realtors also advocated for the passage of legislation adopted in Nassau County in 2019 that imposes a financial penalty on co-op boards that don’t respond to applicants within 45 days. A bill passed in Dutchess County in 2020 requires co-ops to maintain records for seven years of every submitted application, including written notices of the grounds for rejection; co-op boards must produce these records to the Dutchess County Deputy Commissioner for Housing upon request. All but Nassau County require the co-op board to state a reason when rejecting an applicant.</p>
<p><strong>Turning the Tide of History</strong></p>
<p>Absent such legislation, the co-op approval process remains as opaque today as it was when co-ops were first established.</p>
<p>In a 2021 article for The Real Deal, journalists E.B. Solomont and Sylvia Varnham O’Regan wrote about the early pervasiveness of discrimination in New York co-ops. Co-ops gained significant traction in New York City in the early 1900s, they said, when developers, capitalizing on the climate of the day, promoted them as a way to live with others who were both financially stable and “acceptable.” Many of the earliest co-ops had explicit exclusions based on such characteristics as race, ethnic origin and religion. While blatant discrimination is no longer prevalent, the secretive screening process remains firmly intact.</p>
<p>“Too many co-op boards thrive in secrecy and conceal their reasons for denying housing to individuals and families,” says Britny McKenzie, policy manager at the Fair Housing Justice Center in Queens, N.Y. “The passage of a [state] co-op disclosure law will create greater transparency for prospective applicants and deter discrimination.”</p>
<p>In a recent survey conducted by NAR’s Research Group, Realtors were asked about their experiences with co-op transactions. The survey uncovered several questionable decisions by co-op board. One member recounted an experience working with a client who had been injured in an accident and used a wheelchair. The client had received a substantial settlement from the accident, but the co-op board rejected her application, despite her offer to escrow 10. years of assessments. Another Realtor said she represented a single mother of two with stellar financial qualifications who was rejected by a co-op board. Both said they felt discrimination played a role.</p>
<p>Co-op boards can require potential buyers to submit to an extensive interview and make substantial financial disclosures, says Liz English, AHWD, SFR, a West Islip broker. Yet, co-op board members typically aren’t required to take fair housing courses, there’s no mandated protocol to facilitate communication between the co-op board and prospective buyers, and there’s no requirement that obligates co-op board members to disclose the minimum financial threshold buyers must satisfy to be eligible to live in these properties.</p>
<p>English, a member of NAR’s Fair Housing Policy Committee, says Realtors must and will continue to push for fairness and transparency in co-op transactions. “If one person is discriminated against in attempting to purchase a co-op,” she says, “it’s one too many.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>My last article gave a 30,000-foot view of everything that has been going on with the National Association of Realtors and the MLS. Today, I’m going to focus in on the Sitzer/Burnett litigation and what it means to all of us.</p>
<p>In the Sitzer/Burnett case, the plaintiffs primarily focused on the NAR rule requiring listing brokers to offer cooperating compensation in order to list a property on the MLS. They argued that this violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and NAR was colluding with large brokerages to inflate seller costs. They said that, as a result, commissions were too high and buyer brokers were being paid too much. They added that NAR’s Code of Conduct and the MLS Handbook, along with the corporate defendants’ practices, ultimately lead to price fixing.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, NAR’s position was that the cooperating compensation rule was intentionally pro-consumer and pro-competitive and benefits all parties in bringing around a successful transaction.</p>
<p>Prior to the matter going to trial, two defendants agreed to settle. They were Anywhere Real Estate Inc. and RE/MAX. As part of their settlements, they agreed to pay a combined approximately $138 million in cash, they agreed to remind all agents there’s no rule requiring offers of cooperating compensation, that all compensation is fully negotiable, and that brokerages may choose not to belong to NAR. Interestingly enough, aside from the cash settlements, the other factors were irrelevant, as they were always present: nothing changed.</p>
<p>Additionally, what’s important to note is that even though these brokerages gave authority to permit offices/agents to withdraw from NAR membership, it still did not negate the MLS membership requirement that many MLSs carry that require that you must be a Realtor, (i.e. have NAR membership) to gain access to the MLS. This is often seen as a driving force with NAR membership.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, on Halloween, the horror story came to life when the Missouri federal court found in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury held that NAR and the defendants violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and awarded the plaintiffs $1.78 billion. By law, that amount was automatically trebled (tripled) to $5.36 billion. Additionally, the judge on the case must now determine what sort of injunctive relief will be provided (Note: injunctive relief is a court-ordered act to either do something or a prohibition against doing something). Currently, we are waiting to find out what the judge’s ruling will be. It could be nothing; it could be a bar on all cooperating compensation; or it could be something in between. We simply have to wait and see.</p>
<p>NAR has publicly stated that it plans to post a bond and appeal the decision, not only on the liability, but on other procedural grounds as well. But it’s important to keep in mind that an appeal usually is not a “do over.” Also, any appeal may take years to complete. In the interim, NAR, like the rest of us, is waiting on the decision of the judge and has indicated that it will seek a reduction of the award.</p>
<p><strong>After All the Appeals are Exhausted</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to predict what the end result of this litigation will be. First there is the award. This must be satisfied by all the defendants, not just NAR. Will it be reduced? Again, we simply have to wait and see. As for changes to how we do business, there are a few possible outcomes.</p>
<p>A worst-case scenario could be that listing agents would be prohibited from offering cooperating compensation to buyers. Another issue that could arise from this is the possible impact on buyer/agent relationships. Will buyers choose to forego buyer agency representation? Will the cost of purchasing a home and paying a buyer agent’s commission be too much for buyers to bear, forcing them to go it alone? Perhaps we could see the end of dual agency in New York State (numerous states already prohibit it in a real estate setting)?</p>
<p>As for a best-case scenario, if NAR were to succeed in their appeals and their position that offering out buyer agent cooperating compensation is pro-competition and pro-consumer, then we might see things stay the same and it’s “business as usual.”</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Cooperating Compensation</strong></p>
<p>While we await the judge’s decision, the possible appeals, and the outcome of the ongoing and new lawsuits that are substantially identical to the Sitzer/Burnett case moving their way through the courts, we do know one thing; as it stands right now, the future of cooperating compensation being offered on the MLS is in flux. This is because many MLSs, including OneKey MLS, have adopted NAR’s rule that $0.00 is permissible as an offer of cooperating compensation. This means that listings on the MLS may not be offering out any cooperating compensation.</p>
<p>Imagine, you’re a new Realtor. You get your first buyer. You have them sign all the necessary state-required documents and you put them in your car to show them homes. You spend the next month or two taking them around to see homes. Then, one day, you show them a house that they love. They want to make an offer. You’re ecstatic. You write up the offer and it’s accepted! Then you look down and you realize that the listing agent is not offering out any cooperating compensation. Your heart drops. You’ve been working for free. You could ask the buyers to pay your commission, but so much time has gone by and they’re not under any obligation to pay you. Further, they may not have enough money to pay you and finance the purchase of the house. If they say “No, we’re not going to pay you,” what do you do? You may still be required under NY licensing law and the Code of Ethics to act in their best interests as their fiduciary. You’re in a pickle. So, what is an agent to do?</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices: Buyer/Tenant Agency Agreements</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, buyer/tenant agents need to present a value proposition to their clients when they first meet them. Why are you worth being paid a commission? Buyer/tenant agents need to establish their value to a prospective client. Then, once the value of working with the agent is established, the agent can take the next step to request that the client execute a buyer/tenant agency agreement.</p>
<p>This agreement should be executed when you first establish a relationship. What it guarantees is that, in exchange for a promise from the client that they will pay a commission of “X,” the agent will work tirelessly to find them a property. The agent can seek out properties not only on the MLS, but the agent can approach private listings, FSBOs, social media, the Internet, auctions, and even flyers on telephone poles. Additionally, if the agent is permitted to seek cooperating compensation from a listing party (listing agent, FSBO, etc.) and it’s offered, the agent will agree to offset the agreed-upon commission from the client with the commission they will receive elsewhere, thus reducing the amount that the client has to pay the agent (Note: in addition, the client agrees to allow the agent to receive compensation from more than one party). This is a win/win situation: the client can be assured that this agent is committed to acting in their best interest and is searching all avenues available to find the client a property and the agent is assured to receive compensation, and is even willing to save the client money by seeking cooperating compensation elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices: Listing Agreement</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the litigation, the argument was made that sellers/landlords are not fully aware they have options when it comes to paying commissions. So, from the outset, listing agents need to also establish their value proposition and why listing commissions and even cooperating commissions might be important. Listing agents must begin to fully explain at listing presentations and expressly state in listing agreements that the seller/landlord has the choice to negotiate any/all commissions. This includes listing side commission as well as cooperating commissions. They can offer commissions similar to what was previously provided, different commissions, and even no commissions. There is no longer a “traditional standard commission.” The seller/landlord needs to know that if an agent presents an offer that includes having the seller/landlord pay a cooperating commission, they have the right to accept, reject or renegotiate that amount. Transparency is the key.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The future of how the Sitzer/Burnett case resolves is unclear. The future of the similarly situated additional cases is equally unclear. The future of how we conduct business in the real estate industry is also unclear. What we do know is that there is a path that can be taken to navigate this quagmire of uncertainty. It all starts with value propositions, disclosures, and transparency, and ends with the proper and effective use of agency agreements. In the long run, these tools will help all licensees pilot through this fog of ambiguity into the daylight of successful business transactions.</p>

<h3>All in the Family</h3>
<p>John Dolgetta, Esq., HGAR’s 2023 “Affiliate of the Year,” has been a part of the association since 2001—back in the days when it was known as the Westchester County Board of Realtors. “When they called my name for this award, I was not expecting this at all,” he admitted. “It really took me by surprise and I’m so grateful for this honor.”</p>
<p>Over the past 22 years, Dolgetta has played a vital role in facilitating all of the subsequent mergers with the Putnam County Association of Realtors, the Orange County Association of Realtors, the Rockland County Board of Realtors, the Manhattan Association of Realtors, and the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors. In addition, he was involved with the more recent merger of HGAR’s and LIBOR’s MLSs to form OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>“It’s been a great experience,” he shared. “There’s only a handful of attorneys throughout the country who serve as Association Counsels, so this has been really exciting.” Dolgetta’s private practice consists of commercial real estate leasing and sales deals, corporate law, partnerships and shareholder agreements, small business representations and working with brokerage firms on mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>For as long as he can remember, Dolgetta was always interested in becoming an attorney. “I don’t know how old I was when I first met our family attorney, but I just got in my head that I wanted to be a lawyer too,” he said. “I guess I liked the idea of working with people and being able to help them.”</p>
<p>That feeling stuck with him all during elementary and junior high school. By the time he got to Fordham Prep High School in the Bronx, he had a clear picture of his career path and years later, graduated from Pace Law School in White Plains. After growing up in the Bronx near the Botanical Gardens, Dolgetta moved to White Plains when he married his wife, Anna, and eventually, the couple purchased a home in Yorktown.</p>
<p>Determined to get a head start in his profession, Dolgetta worked with a small law firm in White Plains while attending law school, and that eventually became his first job as a new attorney.</p>
<p>As a student, he also worked as a part-time wedding videographer and travel agent. “I always wanted to travel so I worked with a family-owned business in Manhattan and Westchester,” he recalled. “My cousin still owns the company today.”</p>
<p>Later he joined the National Economic Research Associates in Manhattan, where he was involved with legal research and consulting for senior economists in the company. His next stop was Rebound International, Inc., a web-based business-to-business E-commerce firm specializing in international trade.</p>
<p>As In-House Counsel, he negotiated a wide range of agreements including strategic alliance agreements, leases, trade, and employments, and more.</p>
<p>In 2001, Dolgetta joined the Edward I. Sumber law firm and eight years later, became a partner. After Sumber retired as HGAR Board Counsel in 2015, Dolgetta bought the practice, which is now Dolgetta Law PLLC.</p>
<p>Dolgetta was honored with HGAR’s Edward I. Sumber Memorial Award in 2018, following Sumber’s passing. “Ed will always be remembered by so many people at HGAR and beyond,” said Dolgetta.</p>
<p>When he’s not busy running his firm, Dolgetta serves on the Tompkins Community Bank Business Development Board, and from his days as a travel agent—he loves to travel. He and his family have visited Europe many times, with a favorite stop in Italy. They also love visiting the West Coast in the U.S., and have placed Japan, China, and Greece on their “to-do” list.</p>
<p>Ironically, all three of his children are also pursuing law careers. His daughter Carmela, 24, plans to graduate from law school next spring, while his son John, 22, just started. His youngest, Matthew, 19, is also leaning toward law as a career. In addition, his wife, Anna, works with him at his White Plains office. “I guess we’re just keeping it all in the family,” he quipped.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The real estate industry was dealt a major blow when a Missouri jury issued a $5-billion verdict ... and the industry and the defendants did not expect this result.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>The real estate industry has certainly been facing significant legal and economic headwinds in the past few months. On October 31, 2023, the real estate industry was dealt a major blow when a Missouri jury issued a $5-billion verdict against the National Association of Realtors, Inc., Keller Williams, Anywhere, RE/MAX and HomeServices of America (including two of its subsidiaries, HSF Affiliates and BHH Affiliates) in the Burnett-Sitzer case [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Sutacn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Sutacn]</a>. The jury found that these defendants were involved in a conspiracy in violation of antitrust law which had the “effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers.” The industry and the defendants did not expect this result.</p>
<p><strong>The New Lawsuit Filed After <em>Burnett-Sitzer</em></strong></p>
<p>Immediately after the jury in the <em>Burnett-Sitzer</em> case issued its verdict, <em>Inman</em> reported that another class action lawsuit was filed by new plaintiffs against NAR and seven additional defendants, namely Compass, eXp, Redfin, Weichert Realtors, United Real Estate, Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, and Douglas Elliman, Inc. [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40s3hMk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/40s3hMk</a>]. The plaintiffs in this new lawsuit are suing the defendants “for agreeing, combining, and conspiring to impose and enforce an anticompetitive restraint that requires home sellers to pay the broker representing the buyer of their homes, and to pay an inflated amount, in violation of federal antitrust law.” Clearly, the attorneys for the plaintiffs in <em>Burnett-Sitzer</em> took the opportunity to file this new lawsuit in the hope of achieving a similar result. While the defendants in the <em>Burnett-Sitzer</em> case have indicated their intention to appeal, any appeal could take many months or years.</p>
<p><strong>The Economic Headwinds</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the significant legal obstacles faced by the real estate industry, the economic headwinds are just as imposing. The real estate market has experienced a significant downturn in 2023. On October 19<sup>, </sup>interest rates on the 30-year fixed mortgage rose to a multi-decade high of 8.03% [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40rDELE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/40rDELE</a>]. Rates have not reached levels in excess of 8% since 1999 and 2000. In addition to the lack of inventory, which continues to be an issue, these higher interest rates have clearly stunted the real estate market which experienced unprecedented growth in 2021 and 2022. While the rates have come off of the October 19<sup>th</sup> high (i.e., 7.46% as of November 7<sup>th</sup>), they still remain elevated, and many buyers may not want to risk locking in their rates due to the increased fluctuations in mortgage rates. In fact, many may decide against proceeding with a purchase altogether and simply wait it out.</p>
<p>Additionally, historically low inventory levels are likely being affected by the high-interest rates. Sellers, who may want to sell their homes, are holding off because they are locked into mortgages with significantly lower interest rates. It is hard to imagine that it was December 2020 when the 30-year mortgage rates were at a historic low of 2.80% according to <em>Mortgage News Daily</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40rDELE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/40rDELE</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment Rate on the Rise, Recession Risk Heightens</strong></p>
<p>Another economic obstacle is the rise of the unemployment rate. On November 3, <em>Inman</em>, citing Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, reported that “looking at the longer-term trend, the unemployment rate is ‘creeping higher and is on course to breach the 4.0 percent mark soon,’ Shepherdson noted. ‘That would represent a half-point increase from the cycle low; if sustained for three months, this will trigger the Sahm Rule [see <a href="https://bit.ly/463K70n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/463K70n</a>], which notes that every time unemployment rises by a half-point, the NBER [National Bureau of Economic Research] subsequently declares that the economy was in recession at that time.’” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3QtURj9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3QtURj9</a>]. Therefore, while not absolutely certain, the risk of a recession in the coming months has increased.</p>
<p><em>Inman</em> reported that while the unemployment numbers reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics only slightly changed from September to October, they were notably higher than recent lows posted in April 2023. <em>Inman</em> noted that the unemployment rate of 3.9 % was up by .50% and the 6.5 million unemployed was up by 849,000. While increased unemployment may raise the risk of recession, it also reduces the risk that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. In fact, <em>Inman</em> points out that the futures market predicts that there may actually be a rate cut in the spring of 2024. A rate cut will certainly bode well for the real estate and banking industries.</p>
<p><strong>The Antitrust Lawsuits and the Attack on the Buyer’s Agent</strong></p>
<p>In reading the newly filed complaint against NAR and other defendants [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40s3hMk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/40s3hMk</a>] one section stuck out in particular. In Paragraph 19, the complaint alleges that “Defendants’ conspiracy has kept buyer broker commissions in the 2.5% to 3.0% range for many years despite the diminishing role of buyer brokers. Many home buyers no longer search for prospective homes with the assistance of a broker, but rather independently through online services. Prospective home buyers increasingly retain a buyer broker after the client has already found the home the client wishes to buy. Despite this diminishing role for buyer brokers, their percentage of commission has remained steady, due to Defendants’ conspiracy.” However, the allegations made in the complaint are not based in reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of the Buyer’s Agent has not ‘Diminished</strong></p>
<p>The role of the buyer’s agent clearly has not diminished as the plaintiffs allege. In fact, the buyer’s agent’s role has become more critical throughout the past decades. With the increased enactment of legislation relating to the real estate industry, the real estate brokerage industry, fair housing and discrimination, property disclosure issues, and much more, the services buyer’s agents provide are needed now more than ever. While buyers do have the ability to search properties online, and while they may initially search for properties that they may be interested in, many choose to engage a buyer’s agent because of expertise and wide range of critical services a buyer’s agent provides.</p>
<p><strong>A Fiduciary of the Buyer</strong></p>
<p>Most importantly, a buyer’s agent is a legal fiduciary of the buyer. Fiduciaries include guardians, trustees, executors, officers, directors, attorneys, and persons acting in an agency capacity, such as real estate agents and agents acting under a Power of Attorney. The “fiduciary duty” is a critical element of successful day-to-day business operations and interactions in the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Section 443 of the Real Property Law of the State of New York defines fiduciary duties as requiring reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and a duty to account. The law of agency strictly governs the responsibilities of the agent to the principal, so that a relationship of trust and confidence can be built. A fiduciary is a person or entity who or which acts on behalf of another and is a role having one of the highest standards known in law. While a buyer may certainly choose to forgo the right to engage a buyer’s agent, it is strongly recommended that buyers engage a buyer’s agent to represent and look out for their best interest.</p>
<p>Like all fiduciaries, real estate agents have the duties of undivided loyalty (except in the instance of a dual agency relationship), confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and the duty to account. A real estate agent acting in a fiduciary capacity is required to act in good faith and exercise a prudent “duty of care, skill and diligence” when acting on behalf of the individual being served.</p>
<p><strong>The True Services of a Buyer’s Agent</strong></p>
<p>In any given real estate transaction, a buyer’s agent will show dozens of properties to their buyer clients. A buyer’s agent will many times pick up their clients at train stations or at their homes and drive them to see multiple prospective properties each day. They will spend countless hours researching locations, schools, restaurants, available shopping, available commuting options, and many other aspects of a particular property or neighborhood. Many times, all the work mentioned above will have to be done again and again, especially in the current market where often times buyers are outbid and lose properties on which they have made offers. The complaint fails to point out that a buyer’s agent does not get paid unless a transaction actually closes.</p>
<p><strong>An Agent Plays an Integral Role in Providing Required Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>A buyer’s agent is the person who often provides buyers with many of the legally required disclosures, such as those that explain their fiduciary duties and agency status under Section 443 of the New York Real Property Law [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Mv4jBu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Mv4jBu</a>], disclosures required under the Property Condition Disclosure Statement Act [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3FeUEem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3FeUEem</a>], agricultural district disclosures [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3MzzBHl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3MzzBHl</a>], and truth in heating disclosures [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3QObqqf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3QObqqf</a>], to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>A Buyer’s Agent Plays a Pivotal Role in Research and General Assistance</strong></p>
<p>A buyer’s agent at a moment’s notice and upon request will visit the local tax assessor’s office or building department to research a property’s tax and certificate of occupancy history. In connection with co-op and condominium purchases, a buyer’s agent will, when asked, visit the co-op or condo transfer agent’s or management agent’s office to obtain copies of the bylaws (and any amendments), offering plan, rules and regulations, the purchaser’s application packet, and any other important information. Other services a buyer’s agent customarily provides to a buyer are assistance with completing the co-op’s or condo’s application and gathering the required financial documentation.</p>
<p><strong>The Buyer’s Agent’s Role in Recommending Inspections</strong></p>
<p>A buyer’s agent will advise the buyer of the types of inspections that are recommended in connection with any purchase. Particularly in a “Buyer Beware” jurisdiction, a buyer’s agent will ensure that the buyer is made aware of the risks of not completing any of the required inspections, such as physical and engineering, radon, oil tank, termite, well testing and others. The buyer’s agent will recommend a licensed inspection professional expeditiously so that a buyer does not risk losing out on a desired property. In the current environment, the speed with which a buyer conducts all of the required inspections can make the difference in whether a buyer’s offer is accepted.</p>
<p><strong>A Buyer’s Agent’s Role is Critical in Recommending Legal and Lending Professionals</strong></p>
<p>A buyer’s agent may also recommend the buyer to attorneys, lenders and mortgage brokers. It is critical for a buyer to engage a lender or mortgage broker as early as possible in the real estate transaction. The buyer’s agent will recommend a buyer to one or more lenders or mortgage brokers, who can assist the buyer with providing a pre-approval letter that a seller may require at the initial offer stage.</p>
<p>Additionally, the buyer’s agent, particularly one who is knowledgeable about mortgage products, interest rates and other aspects of the mortgage process, is able to advise the buyer regarding the various loan products that may be available, down payment assistance programs for first-time homebuyers, interest rate lock-ins and other closing timeframe issues.</p>
<p>The buyer’s agent will also customarily recommend one or more attorneys to a buyer so that the buyer is able to discuss any legal issues directly with the attorney as soon as possible. The buyer’s agent may refer the buyer to an attorney who is trusted and is knowledgeable about real estate transactions and is familiar with the variety of legal issues that may arise.</p>
<p><strong>All Real Estate Agents Must Battle Through the Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the past several decades, the real estate industry has gone through its share of critical events, market crashes, banking failures, economic downturns, market bubbles, the economic crisis of 2008, the COVID pandemic, and now, there are new obstacles. Tough times require added resilience and fortitude. Whatever the ultimate results are of these lawsuits and after the economic headwinds have subsided, which eventually they always do, the real estate industry will still be there and the buyer’s and seller’s agents representing ready, willing and able buyers and sellers will always be right there as well, providing the guidance and support to the market, which has made them into the consummate and resolute professionals they are.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—More than 80% of metro markets (182 out of 221) posted home price gains in the third quarter of 2023 as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.81% to 7.31%, according to the National Association of Realtors’ latest quarterly report released on Nov. 9. Eleven percent of the 221 tracked metro areas registered double-digit price increases over the same period, up from 5% in the second quarter.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South saw the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (46%) in the third quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 1.7%. Prices also grew 5.3% in the Northeast, 5.2% in the Midwest and 0.6% in the West.</p><blockquote>“Homeowners have accumulated sizable wealth, with a typical homeowner gaining more than $100,000 in overall net worth since 2019 and before the height of the pandemic,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, the persistent lack of available homes on the market will make the dream of homeownership increasingly difficult for younger adults unless housing supply is significantly boosted.”</blockquote><p>Compared to a year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price climbed 2.2% to $406,900. In the previous quarter, the year-over-year national median price declined 2.4%.</p><p>Year-over-year prices in the third quarter retreated by 10.3% in Austin, 1.5% in Phoenix, 1.2% in Salt Lake City and 1.1% in both Dallas and Houston. However, prices rose by 9.6% in San Jose, 8.7% in both Anaheim and San Diego, 6.6% in Boston and 5.7% in Miami.</p><p>“Following the big price changes during the last several years, it’s natural to witness momentary swings in prices,” Yun said. “Some markets that experienced sizable home price gains since 2020 have turned lower, resulting in temporary relief for prospective home buyers. Also, a few markets in the West that experienced price declines in the prior quarter have seen prices rise again.”</p><p>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year price increases all recorded gains of at least 12.6%, with six of those markets in the Midwest. Those include Fond du Lac, WI (18.9%); Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC (17.1%); Oshkosh-Neenah, WI (15.2%); Green Bay, WI. (14.8%); Reading, PA (14.7%); Newark, NJ-PA. (14.3%); Dayton, OH (13.7%); Fort Wayne, IN (12.9%); Farmington, NM (12.7%); and Kankakee, IL (12.6%).</p><p>Eight of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Overall, those markets are San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($1,850,000; 9.6%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,305,000; 8.7%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,300,000; 1.6%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,061,900; -5.8%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($978,500; 8.7%); Salinas, CA ($945,300; 5.3%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($921,500; 3.8%); Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($897,600; 1.4%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($889,900; 1.7%); and Boulder, CO. ($857,800; 3.7%).</p><p>“With consumer inflation becoming more manageable, the Federal Reserve needs to consider cutting interest rates,” Yun added. “In turn, Congress must consider incentives to boost housing supply and inventory so that more Americans can participate in wealth accumulation. The housing market shouldn’t be accessible only to those who are paying in cash nor become a playground for the wealthy.”</p><p>Less than one-fifth of markets (17%; 38 of 221) experienced home price declines in the third quarter, down from 41% in the second quarter.</p><p>Housing affordability worsened in the third quarter because of increasing home prices and mortgage rates. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,192, up 7% from the second quarter ($2,051) and 19.2%—or $354—from one year ago. Families typically spent 26.8% of their income on mortgage payments, up from 25.3% in the prior quarter and 23.5% one year ago.</p><p>Lack of inventory and affordability continued to impact first-time buyers during the third quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $345,900 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment rose to $2,149, up 6.9% from the previous quarter ($2,011). That was an increase of $343, or 19%, from one year ago ($1,806). First-time buyers typically spent 40.4% of their family income on mortgage payments, up from 38.2% in the prior quarter.</p><p>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down payment mortgage in 45.7% of markets, up from 40.3% in the prior quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 2.7% of markets, down from 6.3% in the previous quarter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Each County Day includes a Government Power Hour. This one was particularly substantive, and provided insights into the inner workings of Albany.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under HGAR President Tony D’Anzica’s leadership, there has been a concerted effort to streamline and centralize the HGAR “County Days,” which has greatly benefited the HGAR staff, me included, in our ability to execute these events with greater efficiency. As a result, we have put on some great programming this year throughout the Hudson Valley.</p><p>My chief duty for each County Day is to organize the Government Power Hour—a Q&amp;A with area elected officials from various levels of government who, for an hour, get to talk housing and answer our questions. Generally, each Government Power Hour is great, but the most recent one was particularly substantive.</p><p>At Putnam County Day, on a cold Monday morning, HGAR was joined by New York State Assemblymember Matt Slater (R), State Senator Pete Harckham (D) and Putnam County Executive Kevin Byrne (R). Maybe it was because next year is a major election year, or they were just happy to see our members, but the three of them were a lively bunch. We got some interesting answers to some of our questions that I thought I would share with you.</p><p>Senator Harckham and Assemblyman Slater both answered a question regarding Gov. Kathy Hochul’s housing goals that gave insight into the inner workings of Albany. You may remember that, for the first time in a while, the New York State Budget was late. This was mainly due to the governor’s housing agenda and the inability to make a compromise with the State Legislature. When asked if the upcoming budget season will be just as contentious, both members of the legislature indicated that the governor is backing off from the housing fight. Senator Harckham said that in his talks with the governor’s office, they are leaving the topic up to the legislature for now.</p><blockquote>When it was Assemblyman Slater’s turn to answer he stated that “he was pleased that the governor’s office was giving him the same information.” This was a notable comment on a few levels—mainly that it shows a lot of validity to the governor’s reluctance to take up the topic of the Housing Crisis. Additionally, Senator Harckham and Assemblyman Slater are not only in different houses and political parties, but the senator is a more senior statesman, and the Assemblyman is still in his first term. For such different leaders to be getting the same information in their private talks with the governor’s office is telling. It would seem that the governor is not willing to spend any more political capital on addressing the housing crisis.</blockquote><p>The other notable moment that I want to bring to your attention is an answer that Putnam County Executive Byrne gave in response to what HGAR members can be doing to support local issues. Each County Day, the question gets asked: HGAR has over 13,000 members, what issues would you like to see our members support? We have gotten a lot of different answers to this question, but I think the County Executive’s answer was one of the best. He suggested our members support local development projects. He specifically stated that a lot of new developments get bombarded with one or two neighbors that are strongly “Not in My Back Yard” (NIMBY) on any future development. This in turn causes weeks, if not months, of delays on a project even before a shovel breaks ground—if the developers don’t walk away first. The County Executive pointed to these moments in planning board and zoning board meetings where a lot of housing stock increases and the affordability battle gets lost. County Executive Byrne suggested that we use our membership to sew support of local development to outweigh the NIMBY culture that contributes to the housing crisis. An interesting idea to say the least that I wanted to bring to your attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales dropped in October, according to data released on Tuesday (Nov. 21) by the National Association of Realtors. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales slid in the Northeast, South and West but were unchanged in the Midwest. All four regions experienced year-over-year sales declines. Existing-home sales in the Northeast fell 4% last month.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—fell 4.1% from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.79 million in October. Year-over-year, sales tumbled 14.6% (down from 4.44 million in October 2022).</p><blockquote>“Prospective home buyers experienced another difficult month due to the persistent lack of housing inventory and the highest mortgage rates in a generation,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Multiple offers, however, are still occurring, especially on starter and mid-priced homes, even as price concessions are happening in the upper end of the market.”</blockquote><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of October was 1.15 million units, up 1.8% from September but down 5.7% from one year ago (1.22 million). Unsold inventory sat at a 3.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.4 months in September and 3.3 months in October 2022.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in October was $391,800, an increase of 3.4% from October 2022 ($378,800).

    <description><![CDATA[Lower mortgage rates and easing prices will spark an affordability turnaround, but tight inventory will make renting a competitive option in most markets.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA, CA—Lower mortgage rates and easing prices will help spark the beginning of an affordability turnaround in 2024, according to the Realtor.com 2024 Housing Forecast released recently. But the supply of existing homes will still be tight and renting will remain a competitive option in most markets.</p><p>Overall, in 2024, Realtor.com forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:</p><ul>
<li>Average mortgage rates of 6.8%, with rates edging down over the year to reach 6.5% by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Home prices to ease slightly and drop by 1.7% after generally increasing since 2012.</li>
<li>Rents to drop by 0.2%, making renting a more budget-friendly option than buying in most markets.</li>
<li>A -14% year-over-year drop in inventory, as existing homeowners with low mortgage rates stay put.</li>
<li>Home sales to hold steady, rising 0.1% year over year to 4.07 million.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Our 2024 housing forecast reveals the green shoots we've been waiting to see in the housing market and should give buyers some optimism after a grueling few years. Although mortgage rates are expected to ease throughout the course of the year, the continuation of high costs will mean that existing homeowners will continue to have a high threshold for deciding to move, but we will start to see some interest,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. “Moves of necessity—for job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market—are likely to drive home sales in 2024. Home buyers will continue to seek out markets where they feel like they get the most out of their dollar as they look for homes that better meet their needs.”</blockquote><p>For the New York-Newark, NY-NJ-PA, Realtor.com predicts sales to fall 10.8% in the region in 2024, while prices will increase 3.0% as compared to 2023.</p><h3 id="key-2023-housing-trends-and-wild-cards"><strong>Key 2023 Housing Trends and Wild Cards</strong></h3><p>Affordability will officially turn around in 2024. In 2024, the typical monthly purchase cost for the median-priced home listing is expected to be slightly less than $2,200/month, or about 35% of the typical household income. That's an improvement from 2023, when purchase costs ate up nearly 37% of income and the typical for-sale home cost $2,240. This tick-up in affordability will give a foothold to some buyers trying to break into the market. Buyers planning to get into the market this year should use Realtor.com's Buying Power tool, which uses results from the affordability calculator to tag homes as “affordable,” "stretching," or "difficult" based on typical lending criteria.</p><figure><div><div><div><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2023/12/Housing_Forecast_Infographic-595x1024.jpg" width="595" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt=""></div></div></div></figure><p>Even more sellers hang back, but they could get motivated if rates drop faster than forecasted. Despite the fact that builders have been catching up, the lack of excess capacity in housing has been obvious over the last few years. With home sales activity forecasted to continue at a relatively low pace, the number of unsold homes on the market is also expected to remain low. But if rates drop faster than expected (which is possible given the roughly half-point decline seen in November 2023), this could lessen rate lock sooner and bring more homes to the market than forecasted.</p><p>Shiny new rental construction will hit the market. A once-hot rental market has slowed down, with the rental vacancy rate rising slightly, up to 6.6% in the third quarter of 2023, about where it was right before the pandemic. In 2024, an increase in new rentals will help push vacancy higher, closer to the 7.2% average seen from 2013-2019. While the surge in new rental options gives renters more to choose from, the sheer number of renters will minimize the potential price impact. The median asking rent in 2024 is expected to drop only slightly below its 2023 level (-0.2%).</p><p>Sellers should be ready to compete with new construction. Home sales will likely be driven by moves of necessity in 2024. And even with the lower inventory of existing homes, sellers will be competing with new housing. Single-family home housing starts will increase an estimated 0.4% in 2024. Sellers will need to look at the new construction market in their area to make sure pricing and marketing are competitive.</p><p>Geopolitics and inflation are among 2024's wildcards: Even as markets adjusted to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East heated up to historic levels in the fourth quarter of 2023. Both wars have the potential to affect the global economy in ways that can't be fully anticipated. On the domestic front, the 2024 election season, with its attendant uncertainty, will be in full swing. And while inflation is expected to continue to subside, anything that reverses that trend could raise long-term interest rates, and in turn nudge mortgage rates higher than expected. That might discourage potential sellers from making a move and could keep potential buyers on the sidelines, putting a damper on home sales.</p><p>“Buyers and sellers who are planning to get into the market this year should be prepared. Tools like Realtor.com's RealCost rent vs. buy and affordability calculators can help buyers ensure they are making a sound financial decision based on current interest rates and their personal financial situation. Sellers can use the RealValue tools in Realtor.com's My Home to understand what their proceeds from a sale could be and plug this data into our mortgage payment calculator with current interest rates to understand exactly how much they would pay each month with a new home purchase. Additionally, everyone can see what our projections mean for home prices around the country by checking out the forecast layer in our RealView mapping tool,” Hale added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Public-private investment kept mom-and-pop stores open, provided safe and quality housing for residents, and decreased historic poverty levels — and boosted jobs and businesses by 25% and 20%, respectively.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—The COVID-19 pandemic hit the South Bronx especially hard, but the area’s economy has shown resiliency, according to a report released recently by New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.</p><blockquote>“The South Bronx was hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic but was resilient because of dedicated and hardworking neighborhood groups and advocates, and the strength of its residents,” said DiNapoli. “Still, the need for more affordable housing, jobs and quality of life improvements remain pivotal to the community’s long-term success.”</blockquote><p>Despite the impact of the pandemic, jobs and businesses grew faster in the South Bronx than the rest of the borough and city. This was due in part to community-led investments through the pandemic, stemming from the city’s public-private partnerships to develop commercial, housing and cultural projects. From 2011 to 2022, the South Bronx saw a 25% and 20% increase in jobs and businesses, respectively, led by the health care and social assistance sector. While the area lost 7.7% (6,150) of jobs gained the decade prior due to COVID, the South Bronx added 4,679 jobs in 2022, while new businesses saw an uptick. Federal pandemic assistance helped many South Bronx businesses stay afloat, and in 2022, the area had 78,476 private sector jobs, which accounted for almost one-third of jobs boroughwide.</p><p>“The Comptroller`s report highlights exactly what we know to be true—that the Bronx is resilient and that our residents and small businesses are creating the blueprint for promoting economic growth and prosperity in our city,” said Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson. “Despite the South Bronx being one of the neighborhoods in our borough hardest hit by COVID-19, we are seeing this community rebound as a result of public-private investment that has helped to keep our mom-and-pop stores open, provide safe and quality housing for our residents, and decrease historic poverty levels that for years have prevented Bronxites from achieving the American dream. The data from this report is promising and is a beacon of hope for our borough. But for us in the Bronx, this is the floor and not the ceiling. In partnership with our Bronx Economic Development Corporation, colleagues in government, nonprofits, and private partners, we will continue to fight for economic justice and equity in our borough.”</p><p>“In the face of the COVID-19 storm, the South Bronx stood resilient, fortified by the dedication of neighborhood groups and advocates, like the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, specifically the Small Business Resource Network Program, and the unwavering strength of its residents,” said Lisa Sorin, President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce. “Amidst the challenges, the community's growth, both in jobs and businesses, became a testament to the power of collective efforts and strategic investments, showcasing the transformative impact of public-private partnerships and community-driven initiatives. As we celebrate their success, it is vital that we continue to invest in programs that help them grow and thrive.”</p><p>“During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, business declined more than 30% at Hunts Point Produce Market, a South Bronx staple,” said Phillip Grant, CEO of the Hunts Point Produce Market. “Despite these initial setbacks, the market proved its resilience and ability to withstand economic shocks." He added, "As an essential business, we remained open and fully staffed during the worst of the pandemic, providing the New York region with an uninterrupted supply of fresh fruit and vegetables amid global shortages. Of the market’s 2,000 workers, 65% were Bronx-based. The market is proud to serve as one of the borough’s economic engines and looks forward to supporting its dynamic growth, particularly once our $650 million total renovation is completed.”</p><p>The South Bronx also saw the median household income rise 30.9%, poverty decline 3.4%, and more people move to the area from 2011 to 2021. According to most economic indicators, the area’s economy has proven more resilient than the borough as a whole following the worst waves of COVID. Still the South Bronx has a higher overall poverty rate (36.3%), a lower median household income ($32,381) and fewer adults who graduate from college (14%) when compared to the borough and city. The pandemic further shined light on systemic health, socioeconomic, and environmental disparities in the area.</p><p>Looking ahead, DiNapoli pointed out that more needs to be done to address the community’s concerns on crime, affordable housing, physical and mental health care, and quality of life. DiNapoli encourages continued engagement by elected officials to drive investment in the development and revitalization of the South Bronx, warning its economic recovery could otherwise stall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Pending home sales dropped 1.5% in October, the lowest level since NAR started tracking pending sales more than 20 years ago. But a turnaround could be sight.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales dropped 1.5% in October, according to the National Association of Realtors and reached the lowest level since NAR began tracking pending contract sales more than two decades ago.</p><p>The Northeast posted a monthly gain in transactions while the Midwest, South and West all recorded losses. All four U.S. regions noted year-over-year declines in transactions, NAR stated in its report released on Nov. 30.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—dropped 1.5% to 71.4 in October, the lowest number since the index was originated in 2001. Year-over-year, pending transactions declined 8.5%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><blockquote>“During October, mortgage rates were at their highest, and contract signings for existing homes were at their lowest in more than 20 years,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. “Recent weeks' successive declines in mortgage rates will help qualify more home buyers, but limited housing inventory is significantly preventing housing demand from fully being satisfied. Multiple offers, of course, yield only one winner, with the rest left to continue their search.”</blockquote><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown"><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The Northeast PHSI jumped 2.7% from last month to 64.8, although that figure represented a loss of 6.5% from October 2022. The Midwest index contracted 0.4% to 73.8 in October, down 10.3% from one year ago.</p><p>The South PHSI decreased 1.9% to 85.6 in October, declining 7.1% from the prior year. The West index fell 6.0% in October to 51.8, dipping 10.8% from October 2022.</p><p>“Home sales are rising in places where more inventory is available,” Yun added. “Sales for properties priced above $750,000 were higher than a year ago, because there is more inventory at this price point than what we saw last October. Additionally, newly built home sales are up 4.5% year-to-date due to homebuilders' ability to create more inventory.1 It is vital that we continue to focus on boosting housing supply by all means in all corners of the country over the coming months.”</p><p>NAR notes a turnaround may be in sight, as mortgage rates have started to drop from their recent peaks. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.29% for the week ending Nov. 22, according to Freddie Mac.</p><p><em>Realtor Magazine</em> reports that Yun said that despite the latest borrowing costs edging lower, would-be buyers are now up against another obstacle: finding a home to buy.</p><p>“Recent weeks’ successive declines in mortgage rates will help qualify more home buyers, but limited housing inventory is significantly preventing housing demand from fully being satisfied,” Yun says. “Multiple offers, of course, yield only one winner—with the rest left to continue their search.” Despite a slowdown in home sales, multiple offers are still occurring because of low inventory, and many current homeowners are reluctant to sell. NAR notes that buyers are most likely to face intense competition for starter and mid-priced homes.</p><p>“It is vital that we continue to focus on boosting housing supply by all means in all corners of the country over the coming months,” Yun told <em>Realtor Magazine</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Two 41-story luxury towers anchor the mixed use residential complex, with 906 apartments, 91 affordable apartments, and active street level commercial use space on Buena Vista Ave.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YONKERS—In what Yonkers Industrial Development Agency officials describe as the largest development project to come before the agency in several years, the YIDA Board voted on Nov. 21 its preliminary approval of financial incentives for Teutonia Hall, a $458-million mixed-use residential complex featuring two luxury 41-story towers.</p><p>To be located at 4 Buena Vista Ave., the two-phased project will feature a total of 906 apartments of which 91 will be affordable. The complex will include 2,900 square feet of active street-level commercial uses space. The lower six stories of the building would comprise a podium, which would serve as a parking facility for residents with approximately 907 parking spaces. The proposed podium façade design will emulate the façade of the former Teutonia Hall building using original and recreated materials on a portion of the podium.</p><p>In Phase 1 of the development, project developer AMS Acquisitions will construct the first residential tower and two-thirds of the parking podium. The result will be 510 units along with amenity and support spaces, 544 parking spaces, and approximately 2,200 square feet of retail space. The anticipated construction start date is September 2024 with completion in December of 2027</p><p>In Phase 2 of the development, AMS will construct the second residential tower and the remaining one-third of the parking podium. The result will be 396 units along with amenity and support spaces, 363 parking spaces, and approximately 700 square feet of retail space. The anticipated construction start date is December 2028 with completion in December of 2031.</p><p>AMS is requesting $12.9 million in sales tax exemptions and $4.4 million in mortgage recording tax exemptions. The two phases of the project are estimated to create 1,100 construction jobs.</p><p>In other business, the YIDA Board voted preliminary approval of incentives for Main Street Lofts, a mixed-use residential development featuring 170 apartments and 21,000 square feet of retail space. Located at 66 Main St., the project will be built on the site of a former foundry. It will be the second major development in the revitalization of the Yonkers Downtown Waterfront District.</p><p>The project developer is allocating 35 units—just over 20% of the unit count—to affordable housing, committing to lease 28 of the units to tenants whose incomes were below 50% of the Area Median Income (“AMI”). The developer is requesting a sales tax exemption of $64,801 and 15-year PILOT agreement.</p><p>YIDA Board also voted final approval of incentives for two other projects. Developer Hampshire Management received final approval of financial incentives for the construction of a self-storage facility at 1111 Central Park Ave. The property, which has been vacant for more than 15 years, was formerly the location of the Boulder Creek Steakhouse Restaurant. The $24-million project would transform an undeveloped vacant lot and eyesore on the Central Avenue corridor into an attractive self-storage facility. The 16,600-square-foot building would have office space on the first floor and a 4-bay truck loading area. The applicant is requesting a $750,825 sales tax exemption and a $252,000 mortgage recording tax exemption. The project is expected to create 30 construction jobs.</p><p>The YIDA Board voted final approval of incentives for Whitney Young Manor, a 195-unit, multi-family development located at 354 and 358 Nepperhan Ave. Whitney Young Manor, L.P received approval of $42 million in tax-exempt bond financing, $365,175 in mortgage recording tax exemptions, $1,055,377 in sales tax exemptions and an extension of an 18-year PILOT. Whitney Young Manor, L.P. acquired the property in 2006 and performed rehabilitation of the two 12-story buildings and apartments in excess of $10 million. The developer is performing another rehab of the property with a new affiliated entity, WY Manor, LP. The $79.5-million project is expected to create 330 construction jobs. The rehab work will include an exterior insulating façade system that will dramatically improve the building’s insulation along with a new centralized heat pump system that will provide heating, cooling and domestic hot water, and the installation of new windows and roofs and will include the renovation of most kitchen units.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The RFP is explicit in that the company’s search for a new corporate headquarters site is limited to the White Plains Central Business District.</p><p>According to the RFP, although the Power Authority cautioned prospective proposers that dates could be subject to change, the company hopes to make an award in February or March of 2024 and have the project substantially completed by June 2028.</p><p>The company’s RFP offers prospective developers two options:</p><p>“Option A — Propose an acquisition solution for a new purpose-built state-of-the-art Class A office headquarters within the White Plains central business district market.”</p><p>“Option B—Propose a disposal offer for NYPA’s current property at 123 Main Street, White Plains, New York, 10601.”</p><p>In terms of the new corporate headquarters requirement, NYPA appears to be set on owning the new facility and states in the RFP that it is “prepared to provide funding to support the acquisition, development, and construction of Option A.” It later added that in connection with the new corporate headquarters building it would entertain a new construction commercial condominium.</p><p>In connection with its disposal of 123 Main St. NYPA would consider a fee-simple sale of the 2.7-acre site within three to six months of selection with a five-year favorable leaseback to NYPA; an option agreement for a fee-simple sale with an upfront payment and extension terms and closing prior to NYPA vacating the structure (upon completion of Option A); or a development agreement and ground lease with an upfront payment to NYPA, fixed base rent, participation rent, and capital event participation for a sustainability-forward project.</p><p>The New York Power Authority spells out its intentions in the RFP by stating: “It is intended that any development proposed for Option A does not incorporate the existing property at 123 Main Street as this has been deemed not feasible due to cost and employee impact concerns. For Option B, NYPA is seeking a development partner to purchase, ground lease, or propose a mutually beneficial ownership structure with NYPA for all or a portion of the 123 Main Street property.”</p><p>The company added that the solicitation could allow NYPA to select a qualified developer “with which it may negotiate and enter into one or more definitive agreements for a complete turn-key solution to develop and relocate NYPA to its new White Plains Building.”</p><h3 id="nypa%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98workplace-of-the-future%E2%80%99"><strong>NYPA’s ‘Workplace of the Future’</strong></h3><p>In its solicitation, NYPA stated that it has spent considerable time studying its workforce needs and therefore will require the following for its new corporate headquarters:</p><ul>
<li>a purpose-built state-of-the-art Class A” headquarters with modern employee workstations, facilities, and collaboration spaces;</li>
<li>sustainable, green building design aligned with NYPA’s mission;</li>
<li>conferencing and convening space for employees as well as shared space with its customers and public entities;</li>
<li>parking facilities that provide for a growing electrified fleet;</li>
<li>exterior spaces that give employees the opportunity to interact with each other and the environment;</li>
<li>functional amenities that enhance those in the surrounding community;</li>
<li>incubator and technology zones to support and advance its mission; and</li>
<li>commercially available office and retail space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sources say it is believed that NYPA received a number of proposals from developers/property owners in Downtown White Plains in response to the RFP, including one from Cappelli Development, which is a partner in two major redevelopment projects in Downtown White Plains—the $2.5-billion redevelopment of the former Galleria Mall (Galleria District) and the $650-million redevelopment of the former White Plains Mall (Hamilton Green).</p><p>A spokesman for Cappelli Development told<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the firm is aware of the NYPA solicitation and that it did submit a proposal in response to the RFP. The spokesman did not provide any details on Cappelli’s RFP response.</p><p>In discussions with knowledgeable real estate sources, if NYPA were to move forward with a new corporate headquarters building in Downtown White Plains, few ground-up sites are available. Among those in play could be: the Galleria District, Hamilton Green and the long-delayed project at the former Westchester Pavilion property being developed by Lennar Multifamily.</p><p>Sources also indicate that NYPA was considering relocating to leased space at the Gateway Building prior to the issuance of the RFP, but no deal was finalized.</p><p>NYPA has retained brokerage firm JLL as an advisor in its new corporate headquarters requirement. A JLL spokesman had no comment on the NYPA solicitation.</p><h3 id="plans-for-the-123-main-st-building"><strong>Plans for the 123 Main St. Building</strong></h3><p>The existing 123 Main St. building rises 16 stories and totals 417,014 square-feet with an integrated six-story, 700-space parking structure. The office property was built in 1981 and acquired by NYPA in 1991.</p><p>A clue to the reasons behind NYPA’s quest to build a new corporate headquarters can be found in a section of the RFP when the firm describes its current facilities at 123 Main St.</p><p>“Throughout NYPA’s ownership, numerous maintenance and repair projects have been executed to address deterioration specifically of the garage’s structural members. Reported deficiencies in the original design and construction have led the garage to become susceptible to rainwater intrusion, deicing material corrosion, and repetitive freeze-thaw cycle issues. Recent inspection and analysis have concluded that the garage has reached the end of its useful life and was closed in July 2021.” The firm also noted that “temporary shoring and bracing exist throughout the structure determines a path forward. Note also that repair recommendations exist for the garage portion residing beneath the building that will require attention. Additionally, the building tower remains partially modernized with many floors requiring restacking to accommodate a now-flexible workforce and current workspace expectations. Building infrastructure improvements across its core MEP (Mechanical-Electrical-Plumbing), HVAC, and fuel systems in addition to the façade, roof, and other building core components are also due for investment.”</p><p>NYPA is the largest state electric utility in the country, operating 16 generating facilities capable of producing 6,650 megawatts and more than 1,460 circuit miles of transmission lines. The utility employs more than 2,500 workers state-wide. NYPA produces approximately 70% of New York State’s renewable electricity and 25% of the state’s total electricity. In 2022, 85% of NYPA’s power generation came from clean, renewable hydropower.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[COVID, not taxes, drove 2,400 millionaire households out of New York in 2020-21. Yet New York gained 17,500 millionaire households in the same period, a 7x increase that belies tax migration theories.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—While the Covid pandemic may have driven out a good number of millionaires and other high-income earners out of New York City and New York State, with the pandemic on the wane, the out-migration trends have reversed. A newly released report by the Fiscal Policy Institute reveals that the richest New Yorkers are now far less likely to move out of New York than middle-class residents.</p><p>The “Who is Leaving New York State” report noted that the out-migration numbers have returned to pre-Covid trend patterns where less high-income earners are leaving the state and a greater share of middle-class residents are looking for the exit doors out of the Empire State.</p><p>In addition, the Fiscal Policy Institute analysis found that most high-income earners out-migration during the pandemic was due to flight from New York City among those who could work from home rather than tax-related reasons. High-income earners are defined as the top 1% of New Yorkers—those earning +$815,000 per year.</p><p>After strong population growth during the 2010s, the state was hammered with significant population migration and decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “New York’s strong population growth in the 2010s was concentrated in New York City. The city’s 7.7% population growth through the decade accounted for more than three-quarters (76.5%) of the state’s total population growth. The Covid pandemic brought a sharp reversal to this pattern. Since 2020, the city has accounted for nearly all (93.9%) of the state’s population loss,” the report stated.</p><p>According to the report, during the height of the pandemic (2020-2022), New York State suffered a net domestic migration loss of 595,400 residents, with New York City contributing a net loss of 529,400 city residents to that total.</p><p>Among the report’s key findings were:</p><ul>
<li>Covid, not taxes, explained the high-earner migration out of New York in 2020 and 2021.</li>
<li>High earner migration out of New York during Covid was temporary, and primarily driven by work-from-home and flight from New York City.</li>
<li>In 2022—after two years of elevated, pandemic-induced out-migration—high earners’ migration rates returned to pre-Covid levels. While New York lost 2,400 millionaire households over the past three years (2020- 2022), New York gained 17,500 millionaire households in the same period due to a strong economy and rising wages.</li>
<li>There is no statistically significant evidence of tax migration out of New York.</li>
<li>High earning New Yorkers move out of New York State at one-quarter the rate of the rest of the population during typical, non-Covid years.</li>
<li>Out-migration for those most impacted by recent effective tax increases (in 2017 and 2021) did not increase significantly in response to the tax increases.</li>
<li>When New York’s high earners move, they are more likely to move to other relatively high-tax states.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report noted that despite the press headlines and fears of the state losing high-income earners and revenue due to the pandemic, the state’s strong fiscal and economic outlook has minimized the damage.</p><blockquote>“Despite out-migration by some high earners during the pandemic, <strong>the state’s total population of those earning over $1 million annually grew by about 30% during the pandemic.</strong> Thanks to federal stimulus policies, low interest rates, and a booming stock market, many high earning New Yorkers saw significant income gains during the pandemic. The state’s tax revenues also grew substantially during the pandemic and have remained relatively steady. Thus, not only is high earner tax migration largely a myth, but there is no need to fear for the state’s fiscal and economic future.”</blockquote><p>FPI Director Nathan Gusdorf said of the report’s findings: “In order to address New York’s recent population loss, we must first understand who is leaving—and what is pushing them out the door. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the richest do not leave the state more frequently than other New Yorkers; rather, they typically leave at one quarter the rate of the general population in normal, non-Covid years. Additionally, the evidence dispels the myth that the rich are moving away in search of lower taxes. This analysis finds that tax hikes do not provoke any significant increase in high earner migration out of the state—and when high earners do leave, they are more likely to move to other relatively high tax states than to a low tax state.”</p><p>Gusdorf added, “New York is not struggling to retain the most affluent. New York is losing working and middle-class families. In the face of projected budget gaps, the city and state should avoid cuts to essential public services—which will only make life more costly for the working and middle-class New Yorkers who are already leaving the state at elevated rates.”</p><p>In connection with the report, the FPI conducted a statistical analysis of eight years of data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), tax data from the IRS, and New York State tax data.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Lincoln Correctional to be transformed into mixed-use complex with 105 affordable condominium homes and community-centric spaces on W. 110th St.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled Seneca, the selected proposal to redevelop the former Lincoln Correctional Facility in Manhattan on Dec. 5. The proposed condominium project would invest more than $90 million in Harlem, bringing 105 affordable homeownership units, community spaces, and jobs with ambitious MWBE contracting and local hiring goals.</p><p>A 65% Minority-Owned Business Enterprise partnership led by Infinite Horizons, L+M Development Partners, Urbane, and Lemor Development Group has been conditionally designated to transform the 10,000-square-foot property to deliver affordable homeownership and community-centric spaces.</p><blockquote>“This announcement brings us one step closer to transforming the former Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City into a vibrant, mixed-use development with more than 100 affordable new homes,” Gov. Hochul said. “As part of my commitment to increasing New York’s housing supply, my administration is continuing to follow the recommendations of the Prison Redevelopment Commission and reimagine what’s possible at underutilized jails and prisons. Soon, this project will unlock tools to help us address the housing crisis, create jobs, and improve New Yorkers’ quality of life, and I look forward to working with the development team to bring it to fruition.”</blockquote><p>Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “By transforming the former Lincoln Correctional Facility into 105 units of affordable housing, we are not only creating new pathways to homeownership, but we are also planting the seeds for generations of residents to put down roots and build wealth in the community they call home. Seneca represents the power of reimagination to sow spaces where equitable growth can blossom for a brighter future in Harlem.”</p><p>Located on West 110th Street, the site sits directly across from Central Park and is close to transit, retail, schools, and premier cultural institutions. At the core of this transformative project are 105 affordable homeownership units, all of which would be affordable to households earning 80% and 100% of area median income (AMI) and require only a 5% down payment to purchase, offering an invaluable opportunity to build wealth through property ownership. Creating affordable homeownership opportunities in Harlem would advance social mobility and equity in the community and have a powerful transformational impact on each family at Seneca for generations to come.</p><p>The proposed project will be sponsored by Empire State Development under a General Project Plan, will undergo environmental review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act, and will be presented for public review and comment prior to its final consideration and approval.</p><p>L+M Development Partners Chief Executive Officer Lisa Gomez said, “Our collaborative plan for Seneca centers around creating affordable homeownership opportunities and transforms the former Lincoln Correctional Facility site into a hub of creativity and economic empowerment in Harlem. We are excited to continue our work in this wonderful community, and we are grateful to Governor Hochul, Infinite Horizons, Urbane, and Lemor Development Group for their partnership on this innovative project.”</p><p>Lemor Development Group Co-Managing Member Kenneth M. Morrison said, “Lemor Development Group is incredibly proud to participate in this collaboration to provide affordable homeownership opportunities on Central Park North. This area of Harlem is where my parents grew up, and as a second generation real estate developer, I am pleased to continue my father's vision of solution-based development by providing quality housing in the Harlem community.”</p><p>Beyond housing, Seneca would also serve as a vibrant hub of artistic, cultural, and educational initiatives to enrich and engage the Harlem community. Through collaborations with community partners, the ground floor will be activated with a mix of programming. This includes opportunities for youth to develop artistic skills, flexible spaces for diverse exhibitions focused on educational initiatives centered around social justice and equity, and a dedicated library and reading area.</p><p>Lincoln Correctional Facility closed in 2019 as part of the state’s initiative to redevelop underutilized correctional institutions. In December 2022, Gov. Hochul released the New York Prison Redevelopment Commission recommendations that detail analyses of 12 closed prisons and consider redevelopment opportunities for each site to help them better serve the state's economic needs.</p><p>Gov. Hochul had previously announced a package of executive actions earlier this year to promote housing growth as part of an ongoing commitment to increasing the housing supply and addressing New York's housing crisis. As part of that package, the governor directed state agencies to review lands in their ownership and control and determine whether those sites can be used for housing. In addition to today's announcement, Gov. Hochul has announced requests for proposals to redevelop the former Bayview Correctional Facility and Javits Center's Site K in Manhattan and the former Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill.</p><p>Gov. Hochul has also worked closely with the Queens Borough President to explore potential new uses, including housing options, at the former Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Eastern Queens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[In 2021, the net number of taxpayers leaving the State was still higher than in 2019 at every income level, with the greatest increases for those with incomes over $500,000 (more than double that in 2019) and at incomes below $50,000 (76 percent greater than 2019).]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—Shortly after a Fiscal Policy Institute study found that the migration of high-income earners out of New York City had dropped substantially after the COVID-19 pandemic subsided and a greater share of workforce (middle-class families) are leaving the state, comes a newly released report by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli that reveals the pandemic caused a significant shift in taxpayer movement, with net out-migration quadrupling in 2020 compared to the prior year.</p><p>While declining in 2021, the net number of taxpayers leaving remained one-third greater than the pre-pandemic average, according to the report, which examined personal income tax filings for the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021.</p><p>The State Comptroller’s report released on Dec. 5 found that more than one of every 100 resident personal income tax (PIT) filers left New York State in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant shift in taxpayer movement, with net out-migration quadrupling in 2020 compared to the prior year. While declining in 2021, the net number of taxpayers leaving remained one-third greater than the pre-pandemic average.</p><blockquote>“The pandemic upended everyone’s life and caused a big shift in the movement of New York taxpayers in 2020,” DiNapoli said. “While patterns shifted closer to pre-pandemic trends in 2021, net out-migration rates remained higher, particularly for families. Policymakers need to make sure the state remains an attractive, affordable place to work and to live. Doing so will help maintain the state’s largest revenue source to ensure vital services continue in order to provide a high quality of life for all New Yorkers.”</blockquote><p>PIT is New York’s largest revenue source, with $60 billion in tax liability paid by 10.9 million taxpayers in 2021. Despite the recession of 2020, the number of taxpayers grew, likely due to high financial market levels and enhanced unemployment benefits that increased personal income. In 2021, the number of filers declined, but was slightly greater than the number in 2019.</p><p>The vast majority (87% in 2021) of PIT filers were residents; 10% were non-residents who only pay New York PIT on income received from work, businesses or other income sources located in New York. An additional 3% are part-year residents who file a return if they move into or out of the state, according to the report.</p><p>The 2020 increase in filers was concentrated in full-year resident taxpayers, up by 161,679. The 2021 decrease was also attributable to these taxpayers, down by 235,000 compared to 2020 and 73,500, or 0.8%, lower than 2019. Most of the decline in 2021 was concentrated at incomes less than $100,000, partially offset by an increase in the number of higher-income filers. The number of nonresident taxpayers declined in 2020 but bounced back in 2021, exceeding pre-pandemic levels at all income thresholds.</p><p>The number of part-year filers increased in both 2020 and 2021 and was 19% greater in 2021 than in 2019, building on a steady increase in part-year resident PIT returns filed since 2009. Nearly two-thirds of filers who moved out in 2021 retained no New York source of income after they left, suggesting a potential loss of economic activity, according to the report.</p><h3 id="pandemic%E2%80%99s-impact-on-taxpayer-movement"><strong>Pandemic’s Impact on Taxpayer Movement</strong></h3><p>From 2015 to 2019, there was a consistently larger number of taxpayers leaving the state than coming in, with an average annual net out-migration of roughly 28,700 taxpayers during this period. In 2020, the number moving out of state increased dramatically, resulting in a net out-migration of nearly 112,500—almost four times the number in 2019.</p><p>In 2021, the number of people moving into the state rebounded and was more than one and half times over the year prior, and was also higher than the average in-migration from 2015 to 2019. Still, the number of taxpayers moving out was greater, resulting in a net out-migration of over 39,200, more than one-third greater than the pre-pandemic average. In the aggregate, out-migration rates declined to just over four in every 1,000 taxpayers in 2021 from almost 12 in 1,000 in 2020. However, this rate was greater than the 2019 rate of three in 1,000.</p><p>The report stated: “In terms of the scale of out-migration, 2020 appears to have been an aberration, but the state has steadily experienced an increase in part-time resident filers and more people have been exiting New York than moving to the state on a net basis. …In particular, middle-class families have been leaving the state at the highest rates, and these rates, while lower than 2020, remained elevated beyond pre-pandemic trends in 2021.” This data is in agreement with the Fiscal Policy Institute study which concluded that a greater number of middle-class families have been looking for the exits and relocating out of New York State.</p><p>Single filers comprise the largest share of state PIT taxpayers, and accounted for over half of the net out-migration in 2020. Married and head-of-household taxpayers (families) also left New York at elevated rates in 2020, nearly double those in 2019. In 2021, families continued to exit New York at higher rates than prior to the pandemic. In 2021, an equivalent of one in every 100 married resident filers left New York. Married filers earning between $100,000 and $500,000 continued to experience the greatest out-migration, a trend that continued prior to the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2023/12/Net-Migration-1024x534-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="534" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Net-Migration-1024x534-1.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Net-Migration-1024x534-1.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2023/12/Net-Migration-1024x534-1.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In 2021, the net number of taxpayers leaving the State was still higher than in 2019 at every income level, with the greatest increases for those with incomes over $500,000 (more than double that in 2019) and at incomes below $50,000 (76 percent greater than 2019).</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both prior to and during the pandemic, the majority of taxpayers leaving New York City relocated to the two other downstate regions, with the largest number moving to Long Island.

With the pandemic impacting the city earlier and more severely, net out-migration from the city to places both in and outside the state spiked, with over two in every 100 city residents moving out in 2020. The surge was driven by taxpayers who left the state altogether, and city residents represented 71.5% of the state’s net out-migration in 2020.</p><p>In 2021, the migration pattern shifted once again. The city experienced a net gain of 2,221 taxpayers.

Prior to and during the pandemic, the majority of taxpayers leaving New York City relocated to the two other downstate regions, with the largest number moving to Long Island. However, the number of city taxpayers moving to the other regions of the state more than doubled in 2020 and remained above pre-pandemic levels in 2021.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The largest investment in Eastern Queens in 70 years promises to transform the 58-acre state-owned campus into 2,873 units of new housing, with 55% designated for homeownership.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled the Creedmoor Community Master Plan, a massive mixed-use project to redevelop underutilized land at the 125-acre Creedmoor Psychiatric Center campus in Eastern Queens.</p><p>The plan, released on Dec, 6 looks to transform approximately 58 acres of the state-owned Creedmoor campus from surface parking lots, overgrowth, and vacant buildings into a vibrant new community with homes, recreational spaces, greenery, and neighborhood retail.</p><p>The Creedmoor Community Master Plan introduces approximately 2,800 units of new housing, with more than 55% designated as homeownership. This would represent the area’s single largest new investment in housing since Glen Oaks Village in the 1950s and its largest single expansion in homeownership opportunities since the construction of North Shore Towers in the 1970s. No development cost for the project, as proposed, was released. The master plan is the result of a six-month collaborative planning process led by Empire State Development and the Queens Borough President's Office, facilitated with help from the Metropolitan Urban Design Workshop.</p><p>“Creedmoor represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for New Yorkers to reimagine state land and plan for the emerging needs of tomorrow,” Gov. Hochul said. “Working together in productive partnership with the community—and thanks to the leadership of Queens Borough President Donovan Richards—we can build more housing, create more jobs, and strengthen Eastern Queens for the next generation.”</p><p>Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. said, “The potential before us on the Creedmoor campus is limitless, as the new Creedmoor Master Plan boldly outlines. From thousands of units of housing to historic homeownership opportunities to school seats to community facilities to retail, this plan represents the single largest investment in Eastern Queens in generations, and I could not be more excited for the work ahead. It’s taken decades to get to this moment, and I’m deeply grateful to Governor Hochul, Empire State Development and the residents of Eastern Queens for their tireless dedication and partnership in developing this community-centric proposal from the ground up. We’re making history every day in Queens, and this project is yet another example of our borough’s bright future.”</p><p>The housing component breakdown, according to the master plan, calls for a total of 2,873 units, including 165 earmarked for veterans. The plan calls for 1,633 for-sale units comprised of 813 elevator co-op units in six-to-eight-story buildings; 536 walk-up co-ops in three to four-story buildings; 186 triplexes in three-story buildings; and 98 semi-attached two-family units in two-story buildings.</p><p>The plan, if approved, would feature 1,240 rental units, comprised of 377 senior apartments in six-to-eight-story buildings; 431 supportive units in six-to-eight-story buildings and 432 affordable lottery units, also in six-to-eight-story buildings.</p><p>Most of the structures on campus were constructed between 1920 and 1940. Within the Creedmoor redevelopment site, 19 out of 25 buildings are currently vacant. A significant portion of the Creedmoor campus, including the redevelopment site, qualifies as a historic district eligible for inclusion in the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places. Two key community institutions call the Creedmoor campus home today: Services Now for Adult Persons (SNAP) and the Living Museum. The museum, established in 1983, is located in a former Creedmoor kitchen hall and features a collection of contemporary art created by artists who receive care at Creedmoor. SNAP provides a wide range of programs, including Meals on Wheels, classes, discussion groups, and various events specifically designed for seniors in the area.</p><p>The existing utility infrastructure at the Creedmoor campus would require substantial upgrades to accommodate any new development. Given Creedmoor’s size, the site provides unique opportunities to integrate the newest sustainability best practices and building technologies to reduce demands on area infrastructure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to the master plan.</p><p>The plan also designates approximately 14 acres of open space and sets aside locations for amenities such as a recreation center, daycare facility, school, and neighborhood retail.</p><p>The plan’s development involved an extensive six-month community engagement process which included in-person and virtual workshops that identified priorities like a need for community gathering spaces, diverse housing options, neighborhood retail, and improved transit. Following the plan's release, Empire State Development will form the Creedmoor Community Advisory Committee to provide ongoing guidance on implementation.</p><p>The next steps include commencing an environmental review process in 2024. ESD will also create a General Project Plan and will release requests for proposals (RFPs) to find development partners who will implement the plan in phases.</p><p>Gov. Hochul announced a package of executive actions earlier this year to promote housing growth as part of an ongoing commitment to increasing the housing supply and addressing New York's housing crisis. As part of that package, the governor directed state agencies to review lands in their ownership and control and determine whether those sites can be used for housing.</p><p>Recently, the governor unveiled a proposal to transform the former Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City into a mixed-use development with 105 units of affordable housing. The governor has also announced requests for proposals to redevelop the former Bayview Correctional Facility and Javits Center's Site K in Manhattan and the former Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill with an emphasis on housing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY—OneKey® MLS reported on Dec. 8 its acquisition of Poughkeepsie-based Mid-Hudson MLS, a privately, broker-owned multiple listing service with more than 1,400 agents and approximately 350 offices throughout Dutchess County.</p><p>The acquisition brings OneKey® MLS's subscriber base to nearly 50,000 real estate professionals in more than 4,800 participating offices, serving Montauk to Manhattan and north throughout the Hudson Valley. The consolidation is expected to be finalized in January 2024. No financial terms of the transaction were released.</p><p>OneKey® MLS CEO Richard Haggerty remarked on the opportunity being presented to agents and consumers alike. “I have tremendous respect for the leadership of Mid-Hudson MLS and all they have achieved over the years. This consolidation makes perfect sense because it expands the reach of listing data to a contiguous geography and benefits our members and consumers who will now have access to a greater pool of information. It should result in time savings for our members as well as consumers,” he said.</p><p>“With our operating system due for an upgrade and the challenges facing our industry across the country, the timing of this acquisition works well for us,” said Brian Engles, Executive Officer of Mid-Hudson MLS. “OneKey MLS has a strong agent-centric business model and exemplary operating platform where our brokers and agents alike will benefit from access to the vast and comprehensive listing data offered by OneKey MLS, as well as the many tools which will now be available, including the exposure of their listings on the consumer-facing website, OneKeyMLS.com.”</p><p>Agents and brokers of Mid-Hudson MLS, which was formed in 1994, will now have access to a broader pool of comprehensive listing data. In addition, the consolidation will save subscribers time and money by simplifying access to data, removing duplicate MLS memberships and feeds, and eliminating the need to enter and maintain listings in multiple systems.</p><p>OneKey® MLS's Board of Managers Chairperson Frank DellAccio said the transaction is a logical step for OneKey MLS as it continues to expand its coverage area to provide innovative solutions for real estate professionals and consumers. “This consolidation is a win-win all around,” DellAccio said. “It is our vision to continuously provide broader and better access to accurate data for our agents, brokers and consumers, for the betterment of the entire industry.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The partnership will significantly enhance New York State’s position as a leading candidate to secure anchor hub status under the federal National Semiconductor Technology Center, a designation with the potential to unlock more than $11 billion in federal CHIPS and Science Act funding.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Monday a $10-billion partnership with leaders from the semiconductor industry, including Armonk-based IBM, Micron, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and others to establish a next-generation semiconductor research and development center at NY CREATES’ Albany NanoTech Complex here.</p><p>The partnership will fund the construction of a cutting-edge High NA Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Center—the first and only publicly owned High NA EUV Center in North America – that will support the research and development of the world’s most complex and powerful semiconductors. In addition to the transformative investment in New York’s Capital Region, this partnership will make New York State home to the nation's most advanced, publicly owned semiconductor R&amp;D infrastructure, support the long-term growth of New York’s tech economy, and create and retain thousands of direct, indirect, and union construction jobs.</p><p>To support the project, New York State is investing $1 billion to expand the Albany NanoTech Complex with the establishment of the High NA EUV Center through the purchase of ASML’s EXE:5200 High NA EUV scanner, as well as the construction of NanoFab Reflection, a new, highly sophisticated building with more than 50,000 square feet of cleanroom space that will encourage future partner growth and support new initiatives like the National Semiconductor Technology Center, National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, and Department of Defense Microelectronics Commons program, the latter of which was recently awarded to New York State. The project will create an estimated peak of 500 to 600 union construction jobs at prevailing wage during the two-year construction phase.</p><blockquote>“This $10-billion partnership to bring innovative chips research to the Capital Region should send a message to the entire industry: <strong>New York is open for business</strong>,” Gov. Hochul said. “From our Green CHIPS legislation to Micron’s historic investment and the creation of GO-SEMI, we’re building the future of semiconductor research right here in New York. This industry is creating real opportunity in our state with major regional investments, countless new jobs, and bold commitments to workforce development and sustainability, and my administration will keep working with elected and industry leaders to make New York a global chipmaking superpower.”</blockquote><p>Under this new initiative, NY CREATES will acquire and install a High NA EUV lithography tool, designed and manufactured by ASML, at its Albany NanoTech Complex, where industry partners including Micron, IBM, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and others will use the most advanced semiconductor equipment ever made. Once built, New York’s High NA EUV Center will position the state as a destination for research and development of the innovative chip technology that powers nearly every smartphone, tablet, laptop, and computer server today. The Center will also foster international partnerships as world-renowned research organizations expand their presence here, drawing businesses from around the globe.</p><p>The project is critical to further growing NY CREATES’ Albany NanoTech Complex. In addition to creating 50,000 square feet of state-of-the-art cleanroom space at Albany NanoTech, it is anticipated that this investment opens the door to the construction of additional future cleanroom space to enable the projected long-term growth of new and existing collaborations spurred by the High-NA EUV Center and federal initiatives.</p><p>In addition, this partnership will significantly enhance New York State’s position as a leading candidate to secure anchor hub status under the federal National Semiconductor Technology Center, a designation with the potential to unlock more than $11 billion in federal CHIPS and Science Act funding.</p><p>This project will create at least 700 new direct jobs and retain thousands of jobs, leverage at least $9 billion in private spending and investment, and establish significant commitments to support and build talent development pipelines, including through partnerships with the State University of New York. Partners have committed to either expanding or initiating support for workforce development programming, including investments in SUNY, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and other public and private workforce development activities; K-12 STEM academic programs; training, internships, and experiential learning to undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and related STEM fields, and academic research partnerships.</p><p>NY CREATES and industry partners have also agreed to a range of sustainability commitments throughout the construction and operational phases of the project that are closely aligned with New York’s nation-leading Green CHIPS program, including use of best available technology for greenhouse gas emission reduction; prioritization of renewable energy, with preference for New York sources; and pursuit of minimum Gold LEED status certification for new buildings related to the project. Additionally, partners are committed to integrating sustainability as a primary goal of R&amp;D activities, including sustainable semiconductor manufacturing processes, materials use, waste reuse and reclamation, and fab design. Through this new focus, the High NA EUV Center is positioned to become a global leader in the development of sustainable and climate-friendly semiconductor manufacturing processes and technology.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “This is a landmark day for the Capital Region. With this groundbreaking $10 billion public-private partnership, spurred by my CHIPS and Science Act, industry has made it clear: the Albany NanoTech Complex is home to America’s semiconductor R&amp;D future. This historic partnership will bring the most cutting-edge machinery in the world to Upstate NY, helping make discoveries that engineers today cannot even fathom—ensuring the U.S. leads the world in semiconductor innovation and manufacturing and bringing us closer to turning science fiction into reality by producing microchips smaller than a nanometer, right here in the Capital Region.”</p><p>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “This investment in Albany NanoTech will reinforce New York’s position as a global leader in semiconductor research and development. This next-generation research and development center will be the only facility of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and will draw in major businesses from around the world, grow the state’s tech economy, and potentially unlock billions in federal investments to the Capital Region. Establishing this new semiconductor center will also bolster our national security, allowing the United States to develop the world’s most complex and powerful semiconductors right at home. I am proud to see this partnership come to life and look forward to continuing to work to make the Capital Region a global leader in semiconductor research and manufacturing.”</p><p>The Albany NanoTech Complex, owned and operated by the non-profit New York Center for Research, Economic Advancement, Technology, Engineering, and Science, or NY CREATES, is the most advanced, publicly-owned 300 mm semiconductor R&amp;D facility in North America and has been at the forefront of semiconductor innovation for more than two decades. The site currently totals 1.65 million square feet houses the current generation of EUV lithography equipment, which IBM recently used to produce the world’s first 2 nanometer chip technology—the smallest scale ever developed. The High NA EUV Center will bring the next generation of EUV equipment to Albany NanoTech and firmly establish New York as the epicenter of leading-edge semiconductor R&amp;D.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[After 400 articles about everything from usury to the metaverse and even artificial intelligence, the legal issues in real estate will always keep us on our toes. We'll be ready to report on what you need to know.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since January 1996, “<em>Legal Corner</em>” columnists in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> (and the <em>Westchester Realtor </em>prior to that) have had the honor and privilege of providing critical insights, guidance, legal updates, and general information for real estate licensees, attorneys, other real estate professionals, and the entire real estate industry. Since this is going to be the final physical paper print edition before moving to the fully digital, online version of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> (and along with it, the <em>Legal Corner</em>), I thought it would be only fitting to take this opportunity to review our firm’s archives (dating back to 1990), and revisit some of the amazing topics and developments covered over the past 33 years.</p><h3 id="over-400-articles-in-the-%E2%80%98legal-corner%E2%80%99"><strong>Over 400 Articles in the ‘<em>Legal Corner’</em></strong></h3><p>I could not believe that there were more than 400 articles authored spanning over three decades. From 1990 to 1996, prior Board Counsel, Edward I. Sumber, Esq., wrote many articles (68 to be exact) in the <em>Westchester Realtor</em>, the predecessor to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. In January 1996, the first issue of the <em>Real Estate In-Depth </em>newspaper was published and since then more than 330 <em>Legal Corner </em>articles have been published.</p><h3 id="the-beginning-of-an-amazing-journey-in-the-legal-corner"><strong>The Beginning of An Amazing Journey in the <em>Legal Corner</em></strong></h3><p>January 2001 marked the beginning of my amazing journey. My voyage began with Edward Sumber who opened the door for me to the incredible world of real estate and agency law. One of the first tasks Ed asked me to assist him with was to conduct legal research for his <em>Legal Corner</em> column.</p><p>In June 2001, only a few short months after I was first hired, I assisted with the actual preparation of an article entitled, “<em>Usury: What Is the Maximum Legal Interest Rate?</em>” I remember Ed asking me what I thought would be an interesting topic for the June article. I thought that it would be important for real estate agents and private lenders to know about the legal principle of “usury” and the maximum legal rate of interest permitted by law, especially with regard to private (or “hard money”) financing. Ed agreed and asked me to help him jointly author the article.</p><p>When it was ready to be sent to the Editor John Jordan, Ed included the following notation at the end of the article: “<em>John Dolgetta an associate in the law offices of Edward I. Sumber, P.C., assisted in the preparation of this article.</em>” It was truly an amazing surprise. I immediately realized the importance of that momentous occasion, and to this day, I remain forever grateful. As they say, the rest is history.</p><h3 id="enactment-of-new-york%E2%80%99s-agency-disclosure-law"><strong>Enactment of New York’s Agency Disclosure Law</strong></h3><p>In reviewing some of these early articles, it was clear to me that many of the important issues that exist today, not only existed back then but were also born out of that period. On Jan. 1, 1992, “New York's highly regarded Disclosure Law requiring written disclosure about the nature of Agency relationships and who the real estate broker is representing, became effective.”</p><p>Sumber wrote, “The law has been effective. Buyers and sellers in New York State do seem to have a much clearer understanding of who the broker represents. Moreover, brokers have been forced to focus on the nature of agency relationships and seem better able to articulate the nature of their representation and the limits of the scope of what they can do for a buyer or seller.” The passage of the Agency Disclosure Law still remains one of the most important legislative developments in the real estate industry in New York.</p><h3 id="the-stigmatized-property-law"><strong>The Stigmatized Property Law</strong></h3><p>In 1995, another article reported on the new “Stigmatized Property Law,” which was signed into law by Gov. George Pataki. The new Section 443-a of the Real Property Law finally gave “…brokers and owners firm footing regarding their obligations to make disclosure about homicides, suicides, accidental or other deaths, crimes committed on the premises and the existence of a person having AIDS who has resided in the property.” This law was enacted more than 28 years ago, and yet, it remains a topic that is written about frequently to this day.</p><h3 id="strict-liability-for-oil-spills-and-rights-to-recovery-from-prior-owner"><strong>Strict Liability for Oil Spills and Rights&nbsp;To Recovery From Prior Owner</strong></h3><p>In the September 1995 article, it was reported that “the New York State Court of Appeals in the matter of <em>White v. Long</em> affirmed the doctrine of strict liability under the Navigation Act for cleanup costs arising from an environmental spill against a seller….” The court held that the Navigation Act of the State of New York imposes strict liability on any owner regardless of whether that person caused the spill. However, a subsequent owner had the right to seek reimbursement of costs from a prior owner.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%98can-a-co-op-board-discriminate%E2%80%99"><strong>‘Can a Co-op Board Discriminate’</strong></h3><p>While the recent passage of the Co-op Transparency and Disclosure legislation has been heralded, this subject has been a matter of focus for many years. In October 1994, an article entitled “<em>Can a Coop Board Discriminate</em>” focused on the decision <em>In the Matter of Levandusky v. One Fifth Avenue Apartment Corp.</em> (75 N.Y.2D 530), where the New York State Court of Appeals set forth the rules for examining a co-op board's decisions. The article discussed the corporate “Business Judgment Rule” and explained that “judicial inquiry is prohibited regarding action of corporate directors ‘taken in good faith and in the exercise of honest judgment in the lawful and legitimate furtherance of corporate purposes.’”</p><p>Nevertheless, Chief Justice Judith Kaye noted that the courts may review “improper decisions…when the challenger demonstrates that the board's action has no legitimate relationship to the welfare of the cooperative, deliberately singles out individuals for harmful treatment, is taken without notice or consideration of the relevant facts, or is beyond the scope of the board's authority.” Racial and other unlawful discrimination is not a matter of the “business judgment” of the corporate board and exposes its board members to challenge and liability.</p><h3 id="the-first-legal-corner-article-nar%E2%80%99s-update-to-code-of-ethics"><strong>The First <em>Legal Corner</em> Article: NAR’s Update to Code of Ethics</strong></h3><p>The first <em>Legal Corner</em> article published in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> in January of 1996 entitled “Ethical Standards Easily Forgotten” focused on the major changes of the previous decade, which were reflected in NAR’s Realtor Code of Ethics, which underwent major restructuring in 1995. The article reviewed the Code of Ethics Standards of Practice in light of accepted offers, the importance of the duty of confidentiality, obligations of cooperating brokers, disclosure of business relationships under RESPA regulations, advertising requirements and the duty to arbitrate.</p><h3 id="the-establishment-of-the-real-estate-board-of-new-york"><strong>The Establishment of the Real Estate Board of New York</strong></h3><p>In November 1996, the <em>Legal Corner</em> discussed the establishment of the Real Estate Board of New York (the “State Board”) which became effective Jan. 1, 1996. The State Board, comprised of 15 members (consisting of both licensed and non-licensed individuals), was granted the authority to promulgate rules and regulations affecting brokers and salespersons. It still exists to this day.</p><h3 id="legal-updates-review-of-dos-decisions-increased-interaction-with-the-dos"><strong>Legal Updates, Review of DOS Decisions,&nbsp;Increased Interaction With the DOS</strong></h3><p>It also became an annual custom to review the major legislation that went into effect the previous year. Many articles focused on the decisions and consent orders issued by the Department of State regarding real estate licensees and interpretations of new rules and regulations. The articles provided invaluable insight and analysis of the legislation and DOS decisions so that licensees were made aware of the issues and pitfalls in their day-to-day interactions with clients and other licensed professionals. In the mid-2000s, it became commonplace to meet with DOS counsel at the semi-annual legal conferences hosted by NYSAR.</p><h3 id="the-property-condition-disclosure-act-of-2002"><strong>The Property Condition Disclosure Act of 2002</strong></h3><p>In February 2003, the <em>Legal Corner</em> reported on the first legal decision (<em>Malach v. Cheung</em>) issued by the courts relating to the newly enacted Property Condition Disclosure Act (PCDA). The judge in that case was harshly critical of the new law. As recently discussed in the October 2023 article [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3GyRxi6">https://bit.ly/3GyRxi6</a>], the first major amendments to the original PCDA will be going into effect on March 20, 2024.</p><h3 id="licensees%E2%80%99-obligations-with-regard-to-megan%E2%80%99s-law"><strong>Licensees’ Obligations with Regard to Megan’s Law</strong></h3><p>Another important article in April 2003, touched upon the obligations of the buyer’s and seller’s agents with respect to disclosure obligations of registered sex offenders. The article discussed the decision in <em>Glazer v. Lopreste</em> (717 NY2d 256).</p><h3 id="the-electronic-and-internet-age-the-advent-of-spam"><strong>The Electronic and Internet Age: The Advent of SPAM</strong></h3><p>The <em>Legal Corner</em> provided updates and insights on a variety of new legislation in the 2000s, such as the CAN-SPAM Act (2004), the Junk Fax Protection Act (2005), the Do-Not-Call Registry, and their relationship to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. The “opt-out” provisions that are part of all present-day communications all originated from the above-mentioned legislation.</p><h3 id="the-2008-economic-crisis-the-rise-of-%E2%80%98short-sale%E2%80%99-experts-changes-to-the-443-disclosure-form"><strong>The 2008 Economic Crisis, the Rise of ‘Short Sale’&nbsp;Experts, &amp; Changes to the 443 Disclosure Form</strong></h3><p>In 2008, and for many years to follow, the economic crisis took its toll on the real estate industry. In 2007, the <em>Legal Corner</em> reported on the Mortgage Debt Relief Act (enacted in December 1997), which did not require homeowners to realize mortgage debt forgiveness as income. With the rise of foreclosures and short sales, real estate agents became experts on short sales and the <em>Legal Corner</em> provided several articles addressing the issues and challenges relating to short sale transactions and distressed properties.</p><p>Another major change, that was reported on, was the introduction of new Section 443 Disclosure Forms. In 2010, the <em>Legal Corner</em> reported that co-ops and condos would now be included under the 443 Agency Disclosure requirements.</p><h3 id="major-developments-in-2009-and-after"><strong>Major Developments in 2009 and After</strong></h3><p>Everyone in the real estate industry recalls the litigation between the Department of Justice and NAR regarding Virtual Office Websites (VOWs). In 2009, NAR resolved its litigation with the DOJ. A major element of the settlement was the requirement that NAR create a Virtual Office Website Policy for all MLSs. The settlement agreement was for a 10-year term and it expired in 2019. Additional major developments covered in the <em>Legal Corner</em> in 2009 included the passage of the Commission Escrow Act, the Home Valuation Code of Conduct and changes to the adverse possession law.</p><h3 id="from-2016-to-the-present"><strong>From 2016 to the Present</strong></h3><p>In 2016, I took over the full-time preparation of the monthly <em>Legal Corner</em> articles and it has been an incredibly satisfying experience. I have authored nearly 100 articles. In keeping with the past custom, each month the <em>Legal Corner </em>has tried to address all aspects of the real estate industry, and covered topics such as current market developments, new legislative initiatives, discrimination, fair housing and ADA issues, online fraud and cyber security, the implementation of data security and privacy policies, best practices, and much more.</p><p>In 2018, I sadly reported on the passing of one of the most important members and leaders of the real estate and HGAR community, and my mentor and former partner, Edward I. Sumber. Each article I write is a tribute to him and to what I learned from him. In looking back, I am sure he would be surprised, to say the least, as to what has transpired since his passing.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%98long-island-divided%E2%80%99%E2%80%94fair-housing-new-rental-laws"><strong>‘Long-Island Divided’</strong>—<strong>Fair Housing; New Rental Laws</strong></h3><p>In 2018, the entire real estate industry was impacted by the <em>Newsday</em> article entitled “Long Island Divided,” which was the product of a three-year investigation, uncovering far-reaching instances of discrimination and fair housing violations. The piece sparked a focus on curtailing such illegal behavior through the commencement of state agency-initiated investigations, changes in the laws and the addition of continuing education requirements for real estate licensees.</p><p>In June 2019, extensive tenant protection legislation was enacted in the form of the Statewide Housing Security and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. The <em>Legal Corner </em>followed and addressed these important developments.</p><h3 id="the-covid-pandemic-and-remote-closings"><strong>The COVID Pandemic and Remote Closings</strong></h3><p>In early 2020, the world was struck by the COVID pandemic and its impact on real estate, including government-imposed shutdowns. The individual death toll was devastating. Businesses and individuals were negatively impacted. However, unexpectedly, the real estate industry in New York and across the nation, eventually experienced a significant increase in transactions and home values. Critical government assistance and stimulus helped to support the industry, which could have experienced a fate similar to what occurred during the 2008 economic crisis.</p><p>The <em>Legal Corner </em>reported on legislative initiatives from the Cares Act (including the Paycheck Protection Program and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program) to the daily Executive Orders issued by then Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Several <em>Legal Corner</em> articles also focused on the ability to utilize remote closings and electronic signatures to proceed with transactions in what was an unprecedented environment.</p><h3 id="the-last-two-years-from-terrific-to-turbulent"><strong>The Last Two Years: From Terrific to Turbulent</strong></h3><p>In 2022 and 2023, the <em>Legal Corner</em> closely followed the events that led to the significant downturn in the real estate market. <em>Legal Corner </em>reported on the increases in inflation in mid-2022 (to 9.1%) and interest rates to multi-decade highs in November 2023 (to 8.01% for 30-year fixed mortgages). The near collapse of the regional banking system in early 2023 arising from a new form of “bank-run” taking place primarily on the Internet was also a topic of focus. The current year has been a very difficult period. The recent legal antitrust attacks on NAR and real estate firms have also left the entire real estate industry rattled.</p><h3 id="a-new-digital-era-is-upon-us"><strong>A New Digital Era is Upon Us</strong></h3><p>While this may be the last <em>Legal Corner </em>article that will be published in a physical print edition, <em>Legal Corner</em> and <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> will continue to provide the latest updates and information on developments in the industry for many years to come. We will continue to take our responsibility to all real estate licensees and real estate professionals very seriously. In 2023, the <em>Legal Corner </em>discussed topics such as the use of digital currencies, the metaverse, and the utilization of artificial intelligence in the real estate industry.

    <description><![CDATA[Plan to rehabilitate SRO units would add private bathrooms where possible and ensure alignment with supportive services for vulnerable populations.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—While New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has decided not to press forward with her controversial “New York Housing Compact” plan, the governor did announce on Dec. 12 a significant funding plan to rehabilitate or preserve Single Room Occupancy (SRO) apartments as part of her ongoing efforts to address the state’s housing crisis.</p><p>The $50 million in funding, available through the New York State Homes and Community Renewal, will be used for preservation projects that rehabilitate SRO units to bring them into a state of good repair and add private bathrooms to these units where possible.</p><p>The new SRO preservation program is part of the Gov. Hochul’s $25-billion comprehensive plan to create or preserve 100,000 affordable homes across New York, including 10,000 with support services for vulnerable populations.</p><blockquote>“Existing single-room occupancy units are an important aspect of the affordable housing ecosystem, especially for vulnerable individuals that are eligible for supportive services, such as those experiencing chronic homelessness, victims of domestic violence, those living with physical disabilities, and individuals suffering from mental illness,” Gov. Hochul said. “By creating this program, we are adding an important tool to our toolbox as we work to combat the housing crisis, particularly in New York City where these types of apartments provide a safe, secure, affordable home for thousands of residents.”</blockquote><p>HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “Single Room Occupancy units are a vital affordable housing resource and often are aligned with supportive services that play an important role in protecting vulnerable residents and allowing them to remain in their communities and neighborhoods. This innovative $50-million initiative will enhance our existing resources and better ensure that SROs across the state are safe, functional, and in good repair for the people who rely on them for a place to call home.”</p><p>Financing for SRO preservation will be made available through HCR’s current Supportive Housing Preservation Program, which is designed to preserve and improve existing, permanent supportive housing units, including those funded though the Homeless Housing Assistance Program and by the NYS Office of Mental Health.</p><p>The program funding can be used for rehabilitation and related costs to address existing conditions, replace existing components that are beyond their useful life, and include sustainability improvements to extend the useful life and energy efficiency of the project. Details about HCR’s Supportive Housing Program and SRO preservation can be found at <a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/12/hcr-supportive-housing-preservation-term-sheet_2023-12.pdf" rel="noreferrer">https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/12/hcr-supportive-housing-preservation-term-sheet_2023-12.pdf</a>.</p><p>Gov. Hochul’s New York Housing Compact initiative failed to garner the necessary legislative support earlier this year, due in part to opposition of the plan’s circumvention of local home rule, mandated new development goals, as well as support for the advancement of SROs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Antitrust matters are in the news, and they have the potential to affect every Realtor. But really, antitrust is all about playing fair, just like mom always told me. Here's a quick primer, courtesy of mom.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Realtors work in a unique world. They are constantly competing with each other, but they are required under the law to cooperate with each other too. In most cases, this is a friendly conflict. However, at times, it can get ugly and some Realtors will look to improperly leverage situations or others or use questionable tactics for economic gain or to get the upper hand in the industry. This is where antitrust issues arise. Any time a Realtor looks to engage in anticompetitive conduct, the red flag of antitrust litigation can be waived, which could get the agent, as well as the broker, in some hot water. This month, we’ll look at antitrust matters and, perhaps, learn a few childhood lessons I gathered from my mother (who knew she was such an antitrust expert).</p><h2 id="what-are-antitrust-laws"><strong>What are Antitrust Laws?</strong></h2><p>Antitrust laws are laws that regulate the conduct of businesses and ensure a level playing field. They promote competition, prevent restraints on trade, and prohibit stronger parties from using their power to create monopolies. Central to their purpose is protecting the consumer and fostering open marketplace competition, which helps the economy.</p><h2 id="actions-that-violate-antitrust-laws"><strong>Actions that Violate Antitrust Laws</strong></h2><p>To avoid antitrust litigation, Realtors should be aware of the following:</p><h3 id="company-commissionsprice-fixing">Company Commissions/Price Fixing</h3><p>When meeting with a prospective client, it’s important to inform them that commissions are fully negotiable. That applies to sellers and buyers, as well as listing commissions and cooperating compensation that may be offered out. It’s important that you establish your company commission based upon your independent determination of value and be clear that it’s not based upon what competing brokerages charge. Do not establish your commission/fee structure after consulting with the competition and do not discuss your commissions with others. Simply announcing to your competition that you may be setting a certain commission/fee may be sufficient enough for a court to imply that you are inviting others to conspire on setting commissions/fees. It’s important that you clearly convey to the prospective client the fact that the brokerage does, in fact, price its services independently.</p><p>Additionally, do not show up with a pre-filled contract. As noted above, all commissions should be freely negotiated. A pre-filled contract may create the impression that there is no opportunity for negotiation and you are fixing prices.</p><p>Further, any time a brokerage changes a commission, it should document the reason why they are making the change. It’s important to document the justification for the change, whether it’s increases in costs, expenses, the economy, or whatever is driving the change. Something as simple as a memo to the file, to the sales manager, to the staff, or agents is sufficient.</p><p>When making a presentation, a Realtor should not say: “This is the rate every brokerage charges.” “No one on the MLS will show your house unless the commission is X%.” “Before you decide to list with XYZ Realty you should know that because they are discount brokers, members of the association won’t show their listings.”</p><h3 id="other-economic-terms">Other Economic Terms</h3><p>Just like fixing a price, the same applies to other parts of a listing or buyer agreement. Establishing a set length for a listing, a set type of listing (exclusive sell, exclusive agency, office exclusive, open), or the formula for compensation (percentage of sale price, flat fee, etc.) are just as important. Brokerages that have established company policies on the length, type or variability of compensation rates must train their agents to explain these policies to prospective clients. This means communicating to the client how the firm’s policies will allow the client to best achieve their real estate goals. Under no circumstances should a client be told that the brokerage’s terms must be accepted because “this is what all brokers do.”</p><h3 id="bid-rigging">Bid Rigging</h3><p>This is a relatively simple one. Bid rigging is when the brokerages/agents discuss, in advance, how bidding will take place in order and determine the bidding outcome. Discussing bidding strategies is an antitrust violation. An example of bid rigging would be where the Realtor decides who will win a contract by having the “losing” party purposely make bids high enough that bring the other party’s bid up, but not high enough to win the bid; thus, the “winner” will succeed in securing the deal, but at an inflated price. Obviously, this violates free market principles and hurts the consumer.</p><h3 id="geographic-territory">Geographic Territory</h3><p>Antitrust violations are potentially triggered when two or more entities agree to keep their business activities to a specific geographic territory. This scheme is also sometimes called a regional monopoly. Under this plan, the parties agree in advance on regional issues and control. This can apply to small areas, such as an apartment building or a neighborhood, or larger regions such as a town, city, or county. This also applies to predetermined agreements on the types of customers/clients (commercial, residential, land, etc.) that will be handled.</p><p>This concept also extends to “farming,” or the marketing areas of any particular Realtor. No Realtor can claim that “this is my area to market” or that “you cannot solicit anyone in my farming area.” Such a claim impacts the procompetitive nature of business and reduces competition to the detriment of the consumer. Any preconceived plan to carve up control of a region should be avoided.</p><h3 id="competitive-business-modelsgroup-boycotts">Competitive Business Models/Group Boycotts</h3><p>There are a wide variety of real estate brokerages in the marketplace. Each one has its own attractors and offers its own unique benefits. A consumer can compare one to the other and determine which one is best for them. However, sometimes, established brokerages don’t like the new competition. They feel threatened. They don’t approve of the new brokerage’s business model. Perhaps it’s a flat fee business model. Perhaps they offer all sorts of extras and perks that the other brokerages don’t offer. Perhaps they’re a trendy brokerage that appeals to younger buyers. They may even tout themselves as a “disruptor,” a new type of brokerage that is going to shake up the industry.</p><p>Whatever the brokerage’s model, characteristic, or philosophy, other brokerages cannot intentionally refuse to cooperate with them. That is not only a violation of state law, but also a potential antitrust violation. Brokerages in the areas can’t decide, “We’re not going to work with X. I don’t like what they stand for.” Brokerages cannot collude to try to undermine or damage any other brokerage. In short, you cannot boycott, whether openly or secretly. To refuse to permit entrance into a marketplace or to refuse to treat all businesses fairly and equally destroys the free marketplace, restrains trade and hurts consumers.</p><h3 id="meetings">Meetings</h3><p>Whether you’re in a board meeting, a company meeting, or an office meeting, it is important to understand the implications of antitrust laws. Avoid going to any meeting that does not have an agenda. Such meetings have no rails and can quickly run off course. If a meeting begins to discuss pricing, competition, or starts to focus on a particular competitor, it’s best to stop the meeting. It would also be wise to make a “noisy” exit; meaning that you make it apparent that you are leaving the meeting to ensure that those around you are aware of your objection to the subject matter.</p><p>If you’re invited to a meeting with others at a bar or restaurant to “discuss” certain situations in the industry, think twice. This meeting is a sure-fire set up for antitrust conflicts. Additionally, avoid general “gripe” or “rump” sessions where there is no real purpose to the meeting, but the purpose for the meeting is to discuss the real estate industry in general. Avoid meetings with only select groups of brokers/agents (for example: “Let’s get the big three together to discuss this.”). Never attend a meeting where you and another brokerage/agent will “work this out in advance of the meeting.” Such a meeting is a target for antitrust litigation. Similarly, stay away from meetings where you’re flattered to attend by someone who says, “You’re smart, so let’s get on the same wavelength.”</p><h2 id="conclusion-and-my-mother%E2%80%99s-advice">Conclusion and My Mother’s Advice</h2><p>Being competitive is fine, but using unfair advantages are not. Ensure that you don’t run afoul of antitrust laws by conscientiously thinking about your actions. I do it all the time and each time I do, I hear my mother’s voice giving me guidance when I was a child. I’ll share those nuggets of wisdom with you now.</p><ul>
<li>“Play nice in the sandbox.”—This is the best advice my mother gave me as a child and it applies to antitrust matters too. Don’t engage in unscrupulous activities or do things that you know are wrong.</li>
<li>“Don’t gang up on people.”—Don’t engage with other agents/brokerages to attack a singular agent/brokerage.</li>
<li>“Know who’s throwing the party.”—Just like those questionable parties you attended as a kid, don’t attend a meeting (party) if you don’t know the sponsor.</li>
<li>“Know what type of party it is.”—Again, don’t go to a meeting (party) if you don’t know the topics/agenda. Is it a skating party or a keg party? The difference matters.</li>
<li>“Is everyone invited?”—If only a select group is being asked to attend, you might reconsider going. If someone’s being excluded or it’s an exclusive meeting, that’s not nice… and it might give the appearance of antitrust activity.</li>
<li>“Will ‘adults’ be there?”—Know if there will be someone providing guidance/protection. Is the manager or the company lawyer going to be there, or is this an impromptu free-for-all? Make sure there is someone there to handle the “troublemakers.”</li>
<li>“Don’t get sweet talked.”—Don’t fall for someone trying to flatter you into participating in a meeting by saying, “You’re smart, what are you doing about this,” or “Let’s work together to sort this out before we meet with others.”</li>
<li>“Make sure the punch is not spiked.”—Ensure that someone doesn’t have a hidden agenda and is secretly planning something unbeknownst to the other participants.</li>
<li>“Appearances count.”—If your event/activity is on the up-and-up, make sure that it appears that way too. Be open. Be transparent. Be clear.</li>
<li>“If the party gets wild, leave.”— Just like a raging party, if a meeting gets out of hand, make sure you exit as soon as possible. It may be unpleasant to leave, but that’s better than going to jail.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, call your mother: But instead of calling your mom, call me (HGAR General Counsel), the NYSAR Hotline, or your favorite attorney, and ask for legal guidance relating to antitrust activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[This year, we defeated Good Cause Eviction again and lifted the ban of solicitous phone calls — both highlights for HGAR's advocacy efforts and big wins for members.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the days grow colder and the holiday parties roll joyously on, it is a time for reflection and possibly even optimism about the future. January will mark my one-year anniversary as the Government Affairs Director for the Hudson Gateway Association. It has been an exciting year of self-discovery and learning the ins and outs of the Realtor world. So, let’s go through the ups and downs of 2023.</p><p>All in all, HGAR and our members have a lot to be thankful for. We have a new CEO, we surpassed our RPAC goals and HGAR advocacy has had a few exciting wins, including when HGAR came out big for the 2023 Lobby Day. With multiple buses, the use of the capital’s largest lecture hall, and more than 110 people attending, HGAR represented about one-third of the total number of Realtors that participated in Lobby Day this year.</p><p>Better yet, we had a very strong response from 20+ Assembly and Senators who attended our Lobby Day. </p><p><mark>Our participation from both our members and the elected officials led to two notable legislative wins for HGAR and the Realtor community.</mark> </p><p>First is that we advocated against and defeated Good Cause Eviction for another year. The other direct success is that our Lobby Day led to the NYS Assembly to unanimously pass the bill lifting the ban on solicitous phone calls during a State of Emergency.</p><p>Outside of Albany, HGAR experienced some accomplishments here in the Hudson Valley. 2023 saw the streamlining and execution of six HGAR-sponsored “County Days. These informative events all had a Government Power Hour where State Representatives, County Executives, trustees, and other officials gave us their time to answer our questions and hear about their plans.&nbsp; Each County Day had at least three elected officials who handled questions from potholes to housing. Additionally, HGAR’s relationships with area elected officials really came into focus in an unexpected way. After the July rainstorm in Rockland, Orange, and Westchester counties, HGAR granted thousands of dollars in support for residents in this area who were affected by the storm through the Relator Relief Fund. Because of our strong relationships with local elected officials, from Congressman Pat Ryan to local mayors, HGAR was invited to participate in the multiple resource fairs and our messaging and grant information was disseminated by several elected officials’ networks. In the end, HGAR awarded more than $350,000 to over 200 families who experienced damage from the storm. Because of our efforts to help our community, New York State Senator James Skoufis awarded HGAR with the New York State Senate Empire Award.</p><p>To be accurate, the year did not produce all good news. Unfortunately, it is likely that Good Cause Eviction or something else along the lines of Rent for Life will make its return in the 2024 NYS Legislative Session. Also, although the NYS Assembly passed the bill lifting the ban on solicitation calls during a State of Emergency, we still need to push for it to pass in the NYS Senate. So, there is still a lot of legislative work we need to do. Now feels like a good time to mention that Lobby Day 2024 will be on April 30th.</p><p>To be less tongue-in-cheek, 2024 has every right to be a challenging year. Now, more than ever, what we do as individual Realtors and as Realtors who are part of an organization like HGAR has never been more important. 2024 will be a transformative year and we can choose how we are defined as Realtors and members of our community and not wait for someone else to decide our worth. That path to self-determination in the upcoming year is paved with collected advocacy and hope.</p><p>Joining HGAR and the year I have had in 2023 has been transformative. It is an opportunity that I have greatly enjoyed so far. I have found a lot of success and opportunity that I hope to continue through 2024 and beyond. Happy Holidays.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The compensation structure plaintiffs’ lawyers would like to dismantle—one in which listing brokers offer compensation to buyer brokers for finding a buyer—promotes consumer choice, encourages market competition and boosts access to homeownership. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Tracy Kasper<br>NAR President</strong></p><p><em>Editor’s Note: The following story was originally published in USA Today.</em></p><p>In October, eight jurors in a Missouri court were led to believe that the way real estate agents have long been compensated amounts to a conspiracy to violate antitrust laws. The jury's verdict rests on the shakiest of legal grounds but has led to misrepresentations about the real estate industry and what its future holds.</p><p>Plaintiffs’ attorneys, who stand to profit richly should the verdict stand, have filed new lawsuits claiming that our profession involves a concerted effort to overcharge Americans looking to buy and sell their homes. This could not be further from the truth.</p><p>The compensation structure plaintiffs’ lawyers would like to dismantle—one in which listing brokers offer compensation to buyer brokers for finding a buyer—promotes consumer choice, encourages market competition and boosts access to homeownership. On a multiple listing service (MLS) platform, sellers can have their home seen by more buyers, ensure they receive the best offer and sell it for the best price.</p><p>Buyers, whether experienced purchasers or first-time owners, benefit from professional representation as well. For lower- and middle-income buyers in particular, saving for a down payment can be difficult, and the daunting prospect of buying a house will, for many, be the most significant and complex purchase of their lives.</p><p>For these buyers, adding broker compensation on top of closing costs would push the dream of homeownership even further out of reach. This especially would be true for veteran homebuyers because VA loans prohibit them from paying buyer broker fees.</p><h3 id="real-estate-commissions-are-negotiable"><strong>Real Estate Commissions Are Negotiable</strong></h3><p>It's important to understand that the National Association of Realtors' rules do not require any particular amount or type of compensation. Compensation is negotiable between agents and their clients—it can be a percentage, a fixed or hourly rate or any other arrangement.</p><p>NAR also does not set commission amounts, contrary to the false claims of those mischaracterizing our industry. It is up to the listing broker and their client how much compensation to offer a buyer broker, and they are free to offer any amount.</p><p>There’s another, deeper truth that plaintiffs’ attorneys and their proxies choose to ignore: Far from harming consumers, Realtors are foundational to our communities and deliver value across America. I know this not only as the proud president of NAR, but also from personal experience.</p><p>At a young age, I saw firsthand the difference that real estate agents can make in helping families reach financial stability. I was raised by a single mother who moved me and my three siblings 18 times before I was 10 years old. We were living in a small rental when my mom told us she had saved money and had been working with a real estate agent to find a house she could afford.</p><p>I remember the sense of security I felt the first time I walked into that home, and I know that our agent—who owned her own small business in Caldwell, ID, and who celebrated with my family when we crossed that threshold for the first time—made it possible. My story is far from the only one.</p><p>Realtors are hardworking business owners who on average make less than $60,000 a year and work every day to serve our clients. While plaintiffs’ attorneys argue our profession is obsolete, most Americans turn to real estate agents when buying or selling a home because we provide critical services, information and counsel.</p><h3 id="do-you-need-a-realtor-to-buy-a-house-how-real-estate-agents-help-consumers-navigate-the-system"><strong>Do You Need a Realtor to Buy a House?<br><em>How Real Estate Agents Help<br>Consumers Navigate the System.</em></strong></h3><p>We help buyers and sellers navigate a maze of forms and complex paperwork; coordinate with lenders, inspectors, other agents, escrow companies, title companies, appraisers and other professionals; and ensure that our clients’ interests are represented in pricing, negotiation and closing. We also help clients interpret the information they find online or elsewhere.</p><p>NAR always welcomes thoughtful debate about the future of real estate, but we will not remain silent in the face of an onslaught of disinformation designed to undermine the women and men in this profession.</p><p>Realtors across this country will continue to serve our clients every day and help make homeownership a reality for the next generation of Americans seeking the opportunity it provides.</p><p><em>Tracy Kasper is the 2024 president of the National Association of Realtors. She is also the Broker-Owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Silverhawk Realty in the Boise Valley and a majority owner in two other Idaho real estate companies.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New venture to bring stability to rent controlled multifamily housing in New York City in deal supported by broad cross section of New York City and State elected and public officials as well as dozens of local and national non-profits.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—A partnership led by The Community Preservation Corporation (CPC), with Neighborhood Restore HDFC, and Related Fund Management (RFM) as partners announced on Dec. 15 it has closed on two joint venture transactions acquiring a 5% equity interest in two newly formed entities to service the $5.8 billion in loans that consist of a portion of Signature Bank’s loan portfolio secured by rent stabilized and/or rent controlled multifamily housing in New York City.</p><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is retaining a 95% equity interest in the Signature Bank rent-stabilized loan portfolio.</p><p>The FDIC selected the partnership’s bid on six pools out of the Signature Bank loan portfolio. The CPC-Related, Neighborhood Restore HDFC application was supported by a broad cross section of New York City and State elected and public officials, as well as dozens of local and national nonprofit organizations.</p><p>“CPC is proud to work with our partners at Related Fund Management and Neighborhood Restore HDFC to bring long-term financial stability to these properties,” said Rafael E. Cestero, Chief Executive Officer of the Community Preservation Corporation. “As a nonprofit housing finance company with five decades of work in New York City, CPC understands the unique role that rent-regulated housing plays in our neighborhoods, the distinct financial challenges facing its owners and operators in today’s market, and its importance as a haven of affordability to its tenants. We are committed to a mission of preserving the long-term affordability as well as the physical and financial stability of these properties. We look forward to working with our borrowers and community partners to accomplish this mission.”</p><p>The ventures include 868 permanent loans, secured by properties containing nearly 35,000 units – 80 percent of which are characterized as rent regulated. CPC will be responsible for servicing the loans. Building ownership and management of the associated properties will remain the same.</p><p>“We are proud to be collaborating with CPC and Related Fund Management, in partnership with the FDIC, on the Signature bank portfolio of rent regulated assets in New York City,” said Salvatore D’Avola, Executive Director of Neighborhood Restore HDFC. “Neighborhood Restore is committed to the stabilization of this housing and seeks to achieve positive outcomes for the tenants, owners and the surrounding communities. We are prepared to commence this initiative with 25 years of experience providing stewardship to at-risk and distressed properties in neighborhoods throughout New York City.”<br>“Related Fund Management is proud to support CPC and Neighborhood Restore with a strategic equity investment in this venture. Our collective expertise, track-record, and mission to preserve affordable housing will help secure the future of these buildings,” said Justin Metz, Managing Principal, Related Fund Management.</p><p>“From historic investments in public housing to record-breaking creation of affordable and supportive housing, our administration has been unwavering in its efforts to provide safe, affordable homes for New Yorkers,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “It is that commitment that guided our support of The Community Preservation Corporation and Neighborhood Restore, two organizations with decades-long track records of partnering with the city to provide and protect much-needed affordable housing for New Yorkers and that will be faithful stewards of this critical portfolio. And make no mistake: New York tenants in 30,000 affordable homes can breathe a sigh of relief today. We applaud the FDIC for safeguarding these valuable resources and overseeing a fair process with the right priorities.”</p><p>The partnership, which will operate collectively as Community Stabilization Partners (CSP) has decades of experience in the financing, management, and loan servicing of affordable and rent controlled multifamily housing.</p><p>CPC, which is leading the partnership, is a nonprofit multifamily finance company founded in New York City in 1974 to provide financial and technical resources to stabilize underserved communities. Since then, CPC has invested over $14 billion to finance the creation and preservation of more than 225,000 units of workforce and affordable housing, and is an equity investor in the ownership of 4,200 units of affordable housing.

    <description><![CDATA[Although each has a unique view, all agree the residential real estate market in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors market area will improve in 2024.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—While the Federal Reserve continues to say the battle against inflation is not over, the specter of interest rates rising above 8% again appears highly unlikely going forward. Entering 2024, economic pundits and even the Federal Reserve are no longer in disagreement on whether rate cuts are appropriate, their only conflict is how many will take place in 2024 and beyond.</p><p>As recently as November, the average 30-year-mortgage interest rate shot up to nearly 7.8%, but thanks to positive inflation and employment data, rates for the first time since August, have fallen below 7%, hitting 6.95% for the week ended Dec. 14. That brought the monthly mortgage payment for a home priced at $400,000 to $2,118, down from a yearly recent high this autumn of 7.79%. The lower rate yields monthly savings of $183 and $2,196 annually for the same $400,000 home, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>Will this lower rate environment with the prospect of multiple rate cuts provide a spark to what has been a troubled residential sales market in 2023?</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> asked a number of prominent Realtors in the region their thoughts on what they expect the market will look like this spring and beyond in the New York metro region. While they differed on the extent of the improvement, all expect some aspects of the residential real estate market in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors market area to improve in 2024.</p><p>2023 HGAR President Tony D’Anzica, JD, CIPS, AHWD, who is Broker-Owner of Dynamax Realty NYC Inc. of New York City, said that going forward, “I see the market stabilizing a little bit. I do agree (with analysts) that the (recent) Consumer Price Index report was positive, but the way the Fed has been acting for the past year, year-and-a-half they have been aggressive and maybe overly cautious. I don’t see that changing.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Tony-Danzica-2022-819x1024-1-1-1-1.jpg" alt="Tony D'Anzica, 2023 HGAR President" loading="lazy" width="625" height="625" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Tony-Danzica-2022-819x1024-1-1-1-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Tony-Danzica-2022-819x1024-1-1-1-1.jpg 625w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tony D'Anzica, 2023 HGAR President</span></figcaption></figure><p>D'Anzica predicted that the Federal Reserve will not cut rates in the next six months, but in the interim he does expect interest rates and the overall housing market to stabilize. He added that in the short term, he does not expect any large increases in inventory, which will continue to put upward pressure on prices. He said that while rates will be lower, those rates may not prompt those with 3%-4% mortgages to put their homes on the market and finance a new purchase at higher rates. Other potential headwinds for the market and the U.S. economy could come from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.</p><blockquote>“I am a little bit pessimistic over the next six months,” D’Anzica said. “I don’t see the market improving dramatically in a way that is going to impact anybody, really for the better. I think mortgage rates will ease up a little bit, but that is the best we can really hope for.”</blockquote><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Carmen-Bauman-4x5-768x960-2-1-1-1-1-1.png" alt="Carmen Bauman, 2024 HGAR President" loading="lazy" width="625" height="625" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Carmen-Bauman-4x5-768x960-2-1-1-1-1-1.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Carmen-Bauman-4x5-768x960-2-1-1-1-1-1.png 625w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Carmen Bauman, 2024 HGAR President</span></figcaption></figure><p>2023 HGAR President-elect Carmen Bauman, Principal Broker of Green Grass Real Estate of Bronxville, said, “I think the residential market will still have an inventory lag, probably for the first two, if not three quarters. Hopefully, with the (positive) economic predictions, at that point, if interest rates dip a little bit by a basis point or a basis point and a half, then inventory should come back up. I think people are tired of waiting at this point.”</p><blockquote>Bauman, who is also an Associate Broker at commercial real estate brokerage firm RM Friedland, said, “I think the office market is still in the pits. It is a problem and that is why we are seeing repurposing… like the Galleria (at White Plains) project and I think you are going to see more of that.”</blockquote><p>She related that the retail market has gotten stronger and Bauman, who will serve as HGAR’s 2024 President beginning in January, said she was most bullish on the prospects of the retail sector than any other commercial real estate segment in 2024. While the industrial market appears to have plateaued, she noted that the multifamily segment will also continue to perform well in the coming year.</p><p>In terms of the new apartment development in New Rochelle, Yonkers, Mount Vernon and White Plains, Bauman said that most of the new product that has hit the market has been absorbed and there continues to be strong demand for multifamily developments in the northern suburban pipeline.</p><p>Joseph Rand, Managing Partner and Chief Creative Officer of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty said he thinks that “2024 will be a strange market that will look like a buyer’s market in some ways and a seller’s market in others. We’ll see prices stabilize and maybe go down a bit, which is what happens in a buyer’s market. But in most buyer’s markets, sales go down, which I don’t think will happen. Instead, I think sales will go up from their current levels, simply because we’ll finally see an increase in inventory from sellers who are coming off the sidelines.”</p><p>He believes the lower rates will be the key factor in prompting some homeowners to finally get off the fence and put their homes on the market for sale.</p><p>For the past two years, too many potential sellers have sat on the sidelines because they didn’t want to give up their ridiculously low interest rate on their home mortgage,” Rand said. “As rates go down, though, a lot of those sellers will finally get into the market, which will increase inventory and probably drive up sales a bit. But that increase in inventory will probably put some pressure on prices, which will likely stabilize and could even go down a bit.”</p><p>HGAR Past President Anthony Domathoti AHWD, CRS, C2EX, SRS, CIPS, ABR, predicts that with the new year, home sellers will return to the market, mortgage interest rates will stabilize by the second half of the year, the number of home buyers will increase and home prices will continue to rise.</p><p>Domathoti, Broker-Owner of Exit Realty Premium in the Bronx, said, “In looking ahead to 2024, the real estate landscape appears poised to favor sellers over buyers. The current trend of more buyer inquiries than seller listings suggest a promising time for those selling their homes, while potential challenges await buyers.”</p><p>He said that one significant shift in 2023 was that traditional 20% down payment with 80% financing might no longer suffice to secure a bid. He related that unless there's a considerable drop in interest rates, this trend is likely to persist through 2024.</p><p>“Entering an election year, which historically entails added risks, the fundamental necessity for housing remains unchanged. Foreclosed properties entering the market, albeit requiring renovation, might introduce a balancing factor. Investors buying, renovating, and reselling these homes could alleviate some market pressures,” he said.</p><p>He concluded, “As sellers adapt to elevated mortgage rates, it's probable that asking prices will adjust downwards in 2024. A beneficiary of higher rates might be new developments, especially amenity-rich condos, which will likely attract buyers seeking move-in ready homes due to limited resale options and high renovation costs.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[NAR sees green shoots and predicts an improving market in 2024, with four rate cuts to calm inflation and settle mortgage rates near 6%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—A day before the Federal Reserve decided to hold rates steady and indicated it foresees three interest rate cuts in the coming year, the National Association of Realtors held its annual Real Estate Forecast Summit, which reviewed a rather tumultuous 2003 and an improving market in 2024.</p><p>The virtual panel included Dr. Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of Research, National Association of Realtors; Dr. Jessica Lautz, Deputy Chief Economist and Vice President of Research, National Association of Realtors; Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com; Danushka Nanayakkara, Assistant Vice President for Forecasting and Analysis, National Association of Home Builders; Ken Simonson, Chief Economist, Associated General Contractors of America and Dr. Caitlin Sugrue Walter, Vice President of Research, National Multifamily Housing Council.</p><p>NAR’s Yun noted that high-interest rates and low inventory once again battered the existing home sales market, posting an 18% decline in sales in 2023, which followed a lackluster 2022 when the market also experienced an 18% drop in sales from the prior year. Depending on how the market performs in the last two months, the existing home sales market is on pace for its worst year since 2008 or 1995, according to NAR data. New home sales, however, are on track for the third or fourth best years since 2008 and were up 4.5% year-to-date in October 2023. He expects existing and new home sales to increase 13% respectively in 2024.</p><p>While accurately predicting that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady the next day, Yun related that if the Fed were to use the private sector apartment data, the nation’s inflation rate would be at the Fed’s 2% target level and it would therefore be time for the Fed to begin to cut rates. Yun noted that once the official data catches up with the private sector apartment numbers, the Fed will seriously consider cutting interest rates.</p><p>One of the factors that could influence when the Federal Reserve will begin to cut rates is the softening jobs market in a Presidential election year.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/2024_Existing_Downturn.jpeg" alt="Annual Existing Home Sales: Likely 18% Decline, According to NAR" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/2024_Existing_Downturn.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/2024_Existing_Downturn.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/2024_Existing_Downturn.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/01/2024_Existing_Downturn.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yun forecasts that U.S. GDP will grow by 1.5%, avoiding a recession, with net new job additions slowing to 1.7 million in 2024, compared to 2.7 million in 2023 and 4.8 million in 2022.</p><p>After eclipsing 8% in late 2023, he expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to average 6.3% in 2024 and that the Fed will cut rates four times—calming inflationary conditions—in response to slower economic activity. He predicts the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve will come in the late spring.</p><p>Yun expects rent prices to calm down further in 2024, which will hold down the consumer price index. He predicts foreclosure rates will stay at historically low levels in 2024, comprising less than 1% of all mortgages.</p><blockquote>“The demand for housing will recover from falling mortgage rates and rising income,” Yun said. “In addition, housing inventory is expected to rise by around 30% as more sellers begin to list after delaying selling over the past two years.”</blockquote><p>Yun also foresees 1.48 million housing starts in 2024, including 1.04 million single-family and 440,000 multifamily.</p><p>Realtor.com’s Hale was in agreement that the market will improve in 2024, but offered a number of differing views on mortgage rates. In Realtor.com’s recent housing forecast for 2024, Hale said that mortgage rates will average 6.8% for the year and reach 6.5% by the end of the year. Home prices will ease slightly and drop by 1.7% after generally increasing since 2012. Rents are expected to drop by 0.2%. Home sales are expected to hold steady, rising 0.1% year over year to 4.07 million.</p><p>“Our 2024 housing forecast reveals the green shoots we’ve been waiting to see in the housing market and should give buyers some optimism after a grueling few years. Although mortgage rates are expected to ease throughout the course of the year, the continuation of high costs will mean that existing homeowners will continue to have a high threshold for deciding to move, but we will start to see some interest,” said Hale. “Moves of necessity—for job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market—are likely to drive home sales in 2024. Home buyers will continue to seek out markets where they feel like they get the most out of their dollar as they look for homes that better meet their needs.”</p><p>Among Realtor.com’s key housing trends and wildcards include its belief that affordability will turn around in 2024. “In 2024, the typical monthly purchase cost for the median-priced home listing is expected to be slightly less than $2,200/month, or about 35% of the typical household income. That’s an improvement from 2023 when purchase costs ate up nearly 37% of income and the typical for-sale home cost $2,240. This tick up in affordability will give a foothold to some buyers trying to break into the market,” the report stated.</p><p>In addition, the pace of rate cuts and the expected decline in the 30-year mortgage rate could determine inventory levels going forward. “Despite the fact that builders have been catching up, the lack of excess capacity in housing has been obvious over the last few years. With home sales activity forecasted to continue at a relatively low pace, the number of unsold homes on the market is also expected to remain low. But if rates drop faster than expected (which is possible given the roughly half-point decline seen in November 2023), this could lessen rate lock sooner and bring more homes to the market than forecasted,” the Realtor.com report stated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, as part of its ongoing “County Day” programming, celebrated its Manhattan market area on Nov. 28 with a highly informative program that covered a host of association and industry topics.</p><p>Among the key topics of discussion included HGAR initiatives in 2023 and going into 2024 by HGAR President Tony D’Anzica and HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez, a lively legislative panel, the latest update from the highly successful Hudson Yards development and a “Global Spotlight” presentation by FIABCI Partners from Barcelona, Spain.</p><p>The Manhattan County Day was held on Nov. 28 at the Sixth Floor Loft at 873 Broadway.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CORNWALL—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors recently received the prestigious New York State Senate’s “Empire Award” for its role in providing financial assistance to those families who sustained damages to their homes during this summer’s severe flooding throughout the Hudson Valley.</p><p>Through the National Association of Realtors’ Realtor Relief Foundation, HGAR was able to provide $356,079 to 209 households throughout Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, and Orange counties. Each household was eligible for up to $2,000 to be used toward mortgage payments, rent, or hotel expenses due to displacement by the flooding.</p><p>“Each year I am able to honor a limited number of constituents with a New York State Senate Empire Award, an honor given to exceptional businesses that have made a dedicated contribution to their community,” said New York State Senator James Skoufis of New York’s 42nd Senatorial District. “I am pleased to select the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors as a 2023 New York State Senate Empire Award recipient. Your financial contribution helped to alleviate the stress of Hudson Valley residents and provide them relief. Your readiness to help right away shows the dedication and care you have for the community and is very inspiring.”</p><p>HGAR COO Jana Currier spearheaded the operation this summer, contacting the National Association of Realtors to secure the necessary funding to help flood victims in the region. Currier accepted the award on behalf of the association at a ceremony held at State Senator Skoufis’ Cornwall office. “This award is a testament to the collective efforts of our Realtor team and the unwavering support of our community leaders,” she said. “As Realtors, we are committed to being reliable advocates for the communities we call home. This acknowledgement inspires us to continue our commitment to serving and uplifting the wonderful people of the Hudson Valley.”</p><p>HGAR President Tony D’Anzica added his appreciation for the award and the work of both Realtors and association staff involved in the relief effort. “The Hudson Valley residents who suffered damages from the devastating flood this past summer received little, if any, monetary support—except from Realtors, who donated and distributed over $356,000 in critical aid,” he said. “This is a tribute to the selfless hard work of our staff and volunteers at HGAR and to Realtors who are donating millions of dollars and devoting countless hours to volunteer work every day in order to give back to our communities.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Empire-Award-1024x581-1.jpg" alt="From left, Nan Palumbo, YPN Co-Chair; Alex Roithmayr, HGAR Government Affairs Director; Maryann Tercasio; Jana Courier, HGAR COO; New York State Senator James Skoufis; Tony D’Anzica, HGAR President; Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO; Barbara Bodner and Carole McCann, HGAR Orange County Regional Director" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Empire-Award-1024x581-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Empire-Award-1024x581-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Empire-Award-1024x581-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Nan Palumbo, YPN Co-Chair; Alex Roithmayr, HGAR Government Affairs Director; Maryann Tercasio; Jana Courier, HGAR COO; New York State Senator James Skoufis; Tony D’Anzica, HGAR President; Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO; Barbara Bodner and Carole McCann, HGAR Orange County Regional Director</span></figcaption></figure><p>NAR’s Realtor Relief Foundation dates back to 2001 following the September 11 terrorist attacks.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales grew in November, breaking a streak of five consecutive monthly declines, according to data released on Dec. 20 by the National Association of Realtors. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales climbed in the Midwest and South but receded in the Northeast and West. All four regions experienced year-over-year sales decreases.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—rose 0.8% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.82 million in November. Year-over-year, sales fell 7.3% (down from 4.12 million in November 2022).</p><p>“The latest weakness in existing home sales still reflects the buyer bidding process in most of October when mortgage rates were at a two-decade high before the actual closings in November,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “A marked turn can be expected as mortgage rates have plunged in recent weeks.”</p><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.95% as of December 14, falling below 7% for the first time since August 10.

All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><p>“Home prices keep marching higher,” Yun added. “Only a dramatic rise in supply will dampen price appreciation.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index"><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 25 days in November, up from 23 days in October and 24 days in November 2022.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in November were identical to those in October, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Northeast, Midwest and West posted monthly gains in transactions while the South recorded a loss. All four U.S. regions registered year-over-year declines in transactions.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—stayed at 71.6 in November. Year over year, pending transactions were down 5.2%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001. NAR released the November Pending Home Sales Index on Dec. 28.</p><blockquote>“Although declining mortgage rates did not induce more homebuyers to submit formal contracts in November, it has sparked a surge in interest, as evidenced by a higher number of lockbox openings,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</blockquote><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown"><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The Northeast PHSI rose 0.8% from last month to 64.4, a drop of 6.4% from November 2022.

The West index climbed 4.2% in November to 54.0, falling 4.9% from November 2022.</p><p>“With mortgage rates falling further in December—leading to savings of around $300 per month from the recent cyclical peak in rates—home sales will improve in 2024,” Yun added.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/2023-11-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-28-2023-1000w-1500h-682x1024-2.png" alt="Pending Home Sales, November 2023" loading="lazy" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/2023-11-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-28-2023-1000w-1500h-682x1024-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/2023-11-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-28-2023-1000w-1500h-682x1024-2.png 682w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pending Home Sales, November 2023</span></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW HAMPTON—The New York State Dormitory Authority has released the first bid in connection with a planned major expansion at a psychiatric facility in Orange County that a decade ago was slated for closure. The project cost could approach more than $400 million.</p><p><em>CONSTRUCTION NEWS</em> first reported that the Dormitory Authority recently issued a bid entitled “New Forensic Replacement Hospital and HAZMAT Abatement at the Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center in New Hampton (Orange County). The facility was slated for closure by the State Department of Health under a consolidation plan released in 2013, but the DOH later reversed itself and announced it would remain open.</p><p>The expansion project, a partnership between the Office of Mental Health and the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, involves the design and construction of a new state-of-the-art facility and will replace the existing outdated buildings located at 2834 NYS Route 17M that will later be redeveloped. The new building will feature 300 state-of-the-art forensic in-patient beds.</p><blockquote>On Dec. 12, the Dormitory Authority released a bid for Phase One of the project which will include building demolition, hazardous waste abatement, site preparation and site clearing utility work. A Pre-Bid meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (Wednesday, Jan. 3) at the project site in New Hampton at 10 a.m. Proposals are due on Jan. 18, and it is anticipated that work on the first phase could begin in the spring of 2024.</blockquote><p>The proposed project calls for an approximately 340,000-gross-square-foot replacement forensic residential inpatient facility that would be constructed on a mostly undeveloped, approximately 39-acre portion of MHFPC's existing, approximately 69-acre main campus. The proposed replacement facility would accommodate approximately 272 active patient beds with an additional 28 "swing" beds available when needed for a total of 300 beds, a 15-bed net increase over the existing facility.</p><p>The project would also include the construction of new municipal water and sewer connections to the City of Middletown's existing infrastructure, along Route 17M.</p><p>The Dormitory Authority has hired TDX Construction, which is headquartered in Purchase, NY, as the Construction Manager for the project. The development will be constructed by local labor.</p><p>Todd Diorio, president of the Hudson Valley Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, confirmed that the project sponsors have finalized a Project Labor Agreement with the building trades on the project. He said that while no firm cost estimates for the entire project have been released, he believes the overall cost will range somewhere between $300 million to $450 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus has begun his term of office as President of the NYS County Executives’ Association (NYSCEA). Neuhaus replaces the Association’s outgoing president Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. The association announced the start of Neuhaus’ term on Jan. 2.</p><p>The NYSCEA is an affiliate of the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) and represents the 19 counties that have county executives as their chief elected official. These counties, including the City of New York, represent 16.7 million New Yorkers.</p><blockquote>“I’m honored to have been chosen to lead this great organization at such a critical time for New York’s counties and the residents we serve,” said Neuhaus. “Around the state, counties are grappling with a wide array of issues from migration to Medicaid. As president, I’ll have the opportunity to push for innovative and common-sense solutions to these challenges that will benefit the residents of Orange County and counties across the New York State.”</blockquote><p>“County Executive Neuhaus has a proven record of leadership and service to Orange County and to our nation,” said NYSAC President and Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy. “We’re proud to welcome his service to the association and look forward to working alongside NYSCEA to give voice to the interests of New York’s counties.”</p><p>Neuhaus serves in the U.S. Navy Reserves as a Commander, assigned to the Office of the Naval Inspector General. During his tenure as Orange County Executive, he was deployed to Iraq on active-duty orders in 2018, and again to Europe in 2022 to assist with the U.S response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Neuhaus is Orange County's sixth County Executive since the office was established in 1970. As County Executive, Neuhaus has focused on revitalizing Orange County's economic development, enhancing its public health and safety, while improving its infrastructure and stabilizing its budget.</p><p>A life-long Orange County resident and the son of immigrants, Neuhaus was sworn into office on January 1, 2014, after having served as the Town of Chester's Supervisor for six years. He was re-elected for a second four-year term as County Executive in November of 2017. He was also elected recently to serve on the Board of Directors of the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) at the association's Fall Seminar conference held in Erie County.</p><p>"We are honored to have County Executive Neuhaus take on this vital leadership position with the County Executives’ Association. His leadership, vision and experience will be incredibly valuable to our members and the New Yorkers they serve," said NYSCEA Executive Director Stephen Acquario.</p><p>County Executive Neuhaus will serve a one-year term as president. Broome County Executive Jason Garnar is the President-Elect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[A confluence of economic headwinds that included high-interest rates, inflation, low for-sale inventory, as well as international conflicts and domestic political discord, took their collective toll on the residential real estate sales market.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS, NY—A confluence of economic headwinds that included high-interest rates, inflation, low for-sale inventory, as well as international conflicts and domestic political discord, took their collective toll on the residential real estate sales market in the New York metropolitan area, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2024/01/2023-Q4-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-Report-1.pdf" rel="noopener">Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Residential Real Estate Sales Report</a>&nbsp;released today by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR).</p><p>While the sales climate in 2023 was difficult, the industry entered 2024 with some early indications that conditions will improve as the year progresses as the Federal Reserve Board appears to have paused, if not ended, its campaign of raising rates to tame inflation. The Fed has forecast as many as three rate cuts in 2024, while some analysts have predicted the Central Bank could reduce rates four times. Lower rates will surely help alleviate the housing affordability issue impacting some buyers and could prompt more homeowners to climb off the fence and put their homes on the market.</p><p>Home sales were down by double-digits in each of the six counties that make up the HGAR market area (Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Putnam counties). While sales fell sharply in the region, home prices rose throughout the region, driven at least in part by continued strong demand and historically low for-sale inventory. Data for the HGAR report was provided by the association subsidiary OneKey MLS.</p><p>In Westchester County, total home sales were down 23.7% for the full year 2023 and were 15.3% lower in the fourth quarter. The Putnam County market posed a 26.1% decline in total home sales in 2023 and a 16.8% drop-off in the fourth quarter. Home sales in Rockland County fell 25.7% for the full 12 months of 2023 and 20.2% in the fourth quarter. The decrease in home sales in Orange County for the full year was 25.5%, while the market ended the year with a 25% decline in the fourth quarter, according to the HGAR report.</p><p>Rounding out the HGAR markets, Sullivan County posted a 25.8% decrease in total home sales for 2023 and an 18.4% decline in the fourth quarter. While home sales also fell in the Bronx for the full year and in the fourth quarter of 2023, the borough posted the lowest sales decline of all the HGAR markets, down 19.8% for the year and 12.2% in the fourth quarter.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Median-Sales-Price-SF-Homes-2024-Q4.png" alt="Data was provided by OneKey MLS." loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1554" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Median-Sales-Price-SF-Homes-2024-Q4.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Median-Sales-Price-SF-Homes-2024-Q4.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/Median-Sales-Price-SF-Homes-2024-Q4.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/Median-Sales-Price-SF-Homes-2024-Q4.png 2029w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Data was provided by OneKey MLS.</span></figcaption></figure><p>2024 HGAR President Carmen Bauman said the residential sales market last year was difficult. “Not surprisingly, the fourth quarter statistics for HGAR’s geographies are down over last year’s numbers due to the nationwide theme of lack of inventory and high-interest rates,” she said. “Indeed, we closed out the year with an overall negative change in the marketplace averaging a decrease of almost 25% in sales.”</p><blockquote>Bauman, who is an Associate Broker with commercial real estate brokerage firm RM Friedland, noted, “Still, my outlook for 2024 is a positive one. Real estate is not just an investment in bricks and mortar; it’s an investment in the promise of growth and stability. So, let’s keep the faith and see what this year will bring.”</blockquote><h3 id="home-prices-rise-in-most-suburban-markets"><strong>Home Prices Rise in Most Suburban Markets</strong></h3><p>The HGAR report noted that the median sale price of single-family homes increased or was relatively flat in all six counties for the full-year 2023. The Westchester County single-family median home sale price for the full-year rose 4.3% to $850,000, while the median for the fourth quarter shot up 11.8% to $840,000. The median sale price for 2023 in Putnam County dropped slightly by 1% to $485,000, while the fourth quarter median rose by 8.3% to $520,000. The single-family median home sale price in Rockland County for the full-year rose 3.6% to $660,000, while the fourth quarter median increased 8.8% to $680,000. The median single-family home sale price in Orange County rose 6.3% for the year and 6.2% in the fourth quarter to $425,000 and $430,000, respectively.</p><p>Sullivan County’s median single-family home sale price rose 5.7% for the full-year to $280,000 and finished the year strong with a 13.5% increase in the fourth quarter to $295,000. The Bronx posted a 2.7% decline in its median single-family home price for the full year 2023 at $605,000, but registered a 2.5% increase in the fourth quarter single-family home median sale price at $630,500.</p><h3 id="low-inventory-continues-to-plague-market"><strong>Low Inventory Continues to Plague Market</strong></h3><p>The residential real estate market in the region entered 2023 with very low inventory and homeowners who financed their purchases with historic low rates in the 3% to 4% range, were reluctant to put their homes on the market and finance their new purchases at rates that at one time approached 8%.</p><p>For the full year, all markets suffered significant for-sale inventory shortfalls. For example, Westchester County posted a 24.3% decline in residential properties on the market for sale. For some perspective, Westchester ended the year with 1,044 properties on the market for sale. At the end of 2020, there were 2,344 available properties for sale. Putnam County posted a dramatic 31.4% decline in inventory to 140 properties for sale at the end of 2023. Rockland County’s for-sale inventory at year-end 2023 was flat (down 0.8%) with 356 properties for sale. Orange County registered a 9.8% decline in inventory to 691 available properties. Sullivan County’s inventory was also flat at year’s end (down 0.3%)as compared to 12 months earlier with 329 available properties. Finally, the Bronx suffered a 17.6% drop in inventory for 2023 as compared to a year earlier and ended the year at 951 properties on the market for sale.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The turmoil at the embattled National Association of Realtors continues. Earlier today (Jan. 8), NAR announced that 2024 NAR President Tracy Kasper had resigned over a blackmail threat she received to disclose a “past personal, non-financial matter unless she compromised her position at NAR.”</p><p>Kasper stated in an announcement that she refused to compromise her position and in fact reported the threat to law enforcement. NAR President-elect Kevin Sears has stepped into the role of NAR President, effective immediately.</p><p>While not providing any further details on the specifics and/or source of the threat, Kasper said that she felt under the circumstances it was best for the organization that she step down. In the announcement, NAR stated that its “Leadership Team is deeply concerned about any attempt to undermine its governance and, as a result, is taking steps to protect the integrity of the organization.”</p><p>“As president and a long-time member of NAR, I always have put the interests of NAR first. As a result of the recent threat and given the significance of this moment for myself, my family and the organization, it is again time for me to put the interests of NAR first,” Kasper said. “So, it is with a mix of gratitude and a heavy heart that I submit my resignation as your president effective immediately. In doing so, it gives our Leadership Team the ability to take the reins and forge forward in effecting the change that we all have worked so hard over the past few months to begin.

    <description><![CDATA[With NYSAR's input, a new bill allows landlords, owners and brokers to consider the criminal backgrounds of prospective tenants only if they meet the initial applicant criteria to rent or lease. It's a fair balance for all concerned.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the turmoil and negative messaging about NAR and the real estate industry in general, I’d like to take a moment to shed some positive light on how Realtor Associations help to make positive change. So, this week I’m going to quickly look at how NYSAR helped to craft a new bill in New York City that impacts landlords and tenants.</p><p>On Dec. 20, 2023, the New York City Council passed a piece of legislation that addressed a landlord’s ability to use a prospective tenant’s criminal history to reject an applicant. In its draft form, NYSAR expressed concerns over the language and its impact. Because of NYSAR’s concerns with the original bill, it reached out to the members of the New York City Council Committee on Civil &amp; Human Rights. NYSAR held dozens of individual meetings with the committee and, on Dec. 8, 2023, Melissa Gomez, a 20-year licensed broker and the 2022 Chair of NYSAR’s New York City Issues Working Group, provided testimony to the committee in support of the concerns that NYSAR and its members had about the proposed legislation. As a result of these efforts, the revisions advocated for by NYSAR were embodied in the bill, which is expected to be signed into law by New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with an effective date of Jan. 1, 2025.</p><h3 id="the-bill"><strong>The Bill</strong></h3><p>The original bill was introduced a few years ago. </p><blockquote>The bill, known as the Fair Chance for Housing Act, was immediately considered by many to be overly broad and was even thought to potentially make residential buildings unsafe, as it initially barred landlords from conducting most criminal background checks. As a result, there was a lot of push back from landlords and other real estate professional groups.</blockquote><p>In its original form, the bill sought to ban landlords from conducting most criminal background checks. Its intent was to combat alleged housing discrimination that advocates argued disproportionately impacted black and brown New Yorkers, and that supporters said accounted for 80% of city residents with conviction histories. Proponents of the original bill argued that housing discrimination should not be permitted to be further added to a person’s criminal sentence. They maintained that even criminals should be permitted to move on with their lives and contribute to their communities and the economy and a complete bar on banning criminal background checks should be permitted to level the playing field. Additionally, with increased access to housing, it was argued that it would reduce recidivism and make the city safer.</p><p>Opponents of the bill argued that if landlords were not permitted to conduct criminal background checks it could put the lives of tenants, who may end up living next to those charged or convicted of violent crimes, in danger. Arguably, a serial arsonist of multi-family homes could, once again, find a new target with ease. Further, it could open up the landlord to possible liability for any crimes committed by those with criminal histories because they were not permitted to perform those necessary background checks.</p><p>With the input from various organizations, including NYSAR, its members and, in particular, Gomez, the bill was revised and approved and this newly revised bill finds a fair balance for all sides. The revised bill, while limiting a landlord’s ability to reject rental applications based on past convictions, allows landlords (and brokers) to look at and consider registered sex offenses, misdemeanor convictions from the past three years and felonies from the past five years after completion of a prison sentence.</p><p>As a part of the revised bill, a landlord, owner, broker, or other appropriate entity, must first determine if a prospective tenant meets the landlord's initial tenant applicant criteria. Only after that, may the landlord now review the appropriate criminal history. If they decide to reject the prospective tenant, they must provide a written explanation as to why the rejection was due to a legitimate business interest. Prospective tenants will then have the opportunity to respond and to correct information. Of significant importance is that the bill provides clear indemnification language for property owners, managers, brokers, and agents who comply with the provisions of the bill.</p><p>This bill does not apply to one or two-family, owner-occupied housing or where federal, state or local laws, including laws protecting victims of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, require or permit exclusion based on criminal history.</p><p>In the end, the bill finds a balance. It prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of criminal history, with limited exceptions, but it continues to allow property owners to perform appropriate criminal background checks. This protects the landlord and the current tenants and promotes housing opportunities for individuals with criminal records who are deemed to pose no threat to others.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>In recent months, Realtors have been painted in a bad light. They are portrayed as pariahs and swindlers of the public. The reality is that Realtors care about property rights. They care about people, buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. They pay attention to real estate issues and speak up for communities. Realtor Associations work to advocate for balanced legislation and to find an equilibrium that benefits everyone in society. The world is better off with Realtors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The projects, when completed, will involve approximately $1 billion in upgrades to Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TOWN OF WALLKILL, NY—The New York State Department of Transportation has scheduled afternoon and evening public hearings on Jan. 17 in the Town of Wallkill to provide updates on the projects related to the conversion of a section of Route 17 to I-86 from the I-87 connection in Harriman (Orange County) to Exit 113 in Sullivan County. The projects, when completed, will involve approximately $1 billion in upgrades to Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties.</p><p>In addition, NYSDOT officials are expected to provide information at the public hearings on the status of the planned second phase of the Exit 122 improvement project on Route 17 in the Town of Wallkill. NYSDOT had scheduled a Public Information Meeting on the Route 17 projects on Nov. 15, 2023 but the sessions were postponed due to “unforeseen circumstances.” The Jan. 17 sessions will be held from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Town of Wallkill Community Center, 7-9 Wes Warren Drive in Scotchtown.</p><p>NYSDOT has provided anticipated project timelines for the New York State Route 17 Mobility and Access Improvement Project (Route 17 expansion/I-86 conversion) and the Exit 122 upgrade job at the project’s website at <a href="https://www.route17.dot.ny.gov/#/" rel="noreferrer">https://www.route17.dot.ny.gov/#/</a>.</p><p>The Route 17 expansion, which will be conducted under the federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, calls for a Notice of Intent to be filed and a scheduled Scoping/Public Scoping Meeting in the Winter of 2024, to be followed by the release of a Project Scoping Report in the Spring of 2024 and the preparation and release of the Draft Design Report/Draft Environmental Impact Statement during the period of the Summer of 2024 to the Summer of 2025. The timeline also projects that the release of a DDR/DEIS would be in the Summer of 2025 and during that period NYSDOT would schedule a public hearing and seek public comment. In the Fall of 2025, NYSDOT expects to prepare and issue the Final Design Report/Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision.</p><p>The project website has construction starting on the Exit 122 upgrade in the Spring of 2024 with completion expected in the Fall/Winter of 2025, just as the Record of Decision on the Route 17 expansion project is released.</p><p>At a NYSDOT public hearing in June 2023 on the Route 17 expansion and Exit 122 projects, NYSDOT officials estimated that the Exit 122 project would be valued at between $75 million to $85 million, while NYSDOT expected that once a Record of Decision is rendered in 2025 on the Route 17 expansion, the department would release three projects for bid valued at anywhere from $250 million to $300 million each. Work on those three projects would likely commence in either late 2025 or early 2026, coinciding with the conclusion of work on the second phase of the Exit 122 job. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has committed $1 billion in state funding for the Route 17 expansion project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The governor is proposing a new version of the 421a tax incentive in New York City to spur housing construction, as well as increased state funding for affordable housing projects.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—Gov. Kathy Hochul, in her 2024 State of the State Address earlier today, once again took on the cause of addressing the housing crisis in New York State. This year, the governor is proposing a new version of the 421a tax incentive in New York City to spur housing construction there, as well as increased state funding for affordable housing projects.</p><blockquote>“The State of New York is stronger, healthier, safer and more affordable than it was two years ago when I became Governor, but there is more work to do,” Gov. Hochul said. “Every proposal announced today serves to improve our state and ensure our communities are not just surviving, but that they are thriving. Our New York is our future, and the future is brighter than ever.”</blockquote><p>Her four-part housing proposal is geared to helping New York City increase its housing supply by incentivizing construction of new housing, including affordable housing; encouraging affordable units in office conversion projects; allowing New York City to add residential density on certain projects; and legalizing basement and cellar apartments.</p><p>Other components of the governor’s housing initiative call for the creation of a $500-million capital fund to support the development of up to 15,000 units of housing on state-owned land, including at former correctional facilities, areas near commuter rail stations and under-utilized SUNY properties.</p><p>She also hopes to strengthen the Pro-Housing Communities program by making the certification a requirement for accessing $650 million in state discretionary funding.</p><p>The governor characterized her housing proposals as a “good start, but it is not enough to fix our affordability crisis.” She added that she and other legislative leaders must come with a sense of urgency to address the housing shortage and affordability crisis that is prompting thousands to relocate to neighboring states.</p><p><mark>“Let’s be honest with New Yorkers,” Gov. Hochul said. “The only thing that will solve this problem is building hundreds and hundreds of thousands of homes.”</mark></p><p>In the governor’s State of the State “Our New York, Our Future” presentation, the governor also outlined her proposed regulatory reform. She reported that “the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has begun its process to identify efficiencies in its State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) regulations, including to promote environmentally friendly housing growth while maintaining critical protections for all communities. DEC is poised to commence stakeholder outreach in the beginning of this year. The Department of State (DOS) has adopted SEQR regulations that conform to DEC SEQR regulations and relate to variances for certain housing under the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code and State Energy Conservation Construction Code.”</p><p>In addition, the governor will propose legislation that will make it unlawful for insurance carriers to inquire about or consider tenants' source of income, the existence of affordable dwelling units, or the receipt of governmental housing assistance in the decision to issue or continue to provide insurance for residential real property. The bill would further make it unlawful for insurance carriers to increase insurance premiums on the basis of source of income, the existence of affordable dwelling units, or the receipt of governmental housing assistance. Currently, there is not a clear prohibition against insurers refusing to cover or charging higher premiums to affordable housing.</p><p>Gov. Hochul has also directed Housing and Community Renewal to develop a new public resource to streamline the affordable housing search process and make it easier for housing applicants to find safe, stable, affordable homes. The website will help New Yorkers find state-financed affordable units, determine if they qualify, and apply for those units, all in one place. Housing applicants will be able to search by need, including for accessible homes, homes for veterans, and survivors of domestic violence.</p><p>While proposing some housing-related consumer protections, such as taking action to combat housing discrimination against Section 8 voucher recipients and affordable housing providers, absent from the governor’s State of the State was any mention of “Good Cause Eviction” legislation, which is being supported by some in the legislature. The New York State Association of Realtors and the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors have both come out strongly against Good Cause Eviction proposals.</p><p>Last year, Gov. Hochul in her “New York Housing Compact” plan called for the development of 800,000 homes over the next decade. Her plan would have encouraged annual housing growth of 1% per year downstate and one-third of 1% upstate, with a particular focus on spurring development around transit hubs which have benefited from billions of dollars of State investment. However, the plan proved controversial and did not garner sufficient support from the State Legislature. Many lawmakers criticized the proposal for stripping away local Home Rule.</p><p>In her 2024 State of the State address, the governor also covered a host of other proposals related to mental health, climate change, consumer protection and crime prevention.</p><p>In some of her other business/real estate proposals, the governor is proposing to launch the first of its kind “Empire AI” consortium that would unlock the economic potential of artificial intelligence; bolster state efforts to prepare workers for the jobs of tomorrow by establishing a network of four advanced manufacturing training centers along the I-90 Corridor in Upstate New York and growing statewide business attraction efforts with a $100-million expansion of FAST NY program to prepare sites to be shovel-ready.</p><p>The governor said the Empire AI consortium would consist of seven founding institutions—Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the State University of New York (SUNY), the City University of New York (CUNY), and the Flatiron Institute. Empire AI will be funded through a combination of public and private investment totaling more than $400 million, including up to $275 million from the state in grant and other funding, and more than $125 million from the founding institutions and other private partners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[NAR expects to appeal the case to the court of appeals if the federal judge in Missouri does not grant NAR’s motions.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By REALTOR® Magazine Staff</strong></p><p><em>Reprinted from REALTOR® Magazine by permission of the National Association of REALTORS®. Copyright 2024. All rights reserved.</em></p><p>KANSAS CITY, MO—In post-trial motions in a U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Mo., where the case was tried in October, the National Association of Realtors asked a federal judge Monday to enter judgment as a matter of law in NAR’s favor in the Sitzer/Burnett case, arguing that the jury lacked a “legally sufficient basis” to find for plaintiffs. The association also requested a new trial if the judge declines to enter judgment as a matter of law.</p><p>It’s the first step in NAR’s formal challenge to the verdict, which found defendants liable for keeping agent compensation artificially high. NAR has long maintained that compensation is always negotiable between agents and their clients, which is reinforced by the organization’s MLS rules. NAR expects to appeal the case to the court of appeals if the federal judge in Missouri does not grant NAR’s motions.</p><p>“The verdict was wrong and defied precedent, logic and the evidence,” spokesperson Mantill Williams said on behalf of NAR. “We believe we have solid grounds for our continuing objections to the verdict. Our motions detail our arguments that the verdict was wrong on the facts and that the judge applied the wrong law to the case, which played a large part in the jury reaching the incorrect conclusion.”</p><p>The case stems from a complaint by a group of home sellers in Missouri who alleged that commission rates are too high, buyer brokers are being paid too much and NAR rules lead to fixed pricing. The sellers argued that buyer representation is obsolete and should only be afforded to wealthy buyers who can pay for the services out of pocket.</p><p>At trial, NAR presented evidence that its policies—including the cooperative compensation rule—promote competition and pro-consumer local broker marketplaces that ensure equity, efficiency, transparency and market-driven pricing options for home buyers and sellers. But the judge’s legally erroneous instructions to the jury limited how much the jury could consider such evidence, NAR says, adding that the plaintiffs presented no evidence to support their allegations of a conspiracy and did not substantiate their claims that home sellers were harmed.</p><p>The case covers the Missouri markets of Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield and Columbia.</p><p>While buyer agency remains intact during the appeal process, members can continue to focus on ensuring transparency with clients around compensation, NAR attorneys say. In particular, members should stress the negotiability of their compensation in every single transaction. NAR Chief Legal Officer Katie Johnson urges every member to use buyer representation agreements, which offers a prime opportunity for members to explain their value in the transaction, the services they provide and how they’ll be paid. Members also can take the time to talk about how local broker marketplaces benefit buyers and sellers.</p><p>When working with sellers, NAR attorneys encourage members to explain how it works in their favor to make an offer of compensation to the buyer’s agent: It makes the home purchase more affordable for buyers, and thus, widens the pool of potential buyers for a property. “Everything you do contributes to a vibrant marketplace,” NAR Senior Counsel and Director of Legal Affairs Charlie Lee said at NAR NXT in November. “We encourage you to continue focusing on your clients and serving them well.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Reprinted from REALTOR® Magazine by permission of the National Association of REALTORS®. Copyright 2024. All rights reserved.</em></p><p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors announced Monday that Kevin Sears has stepped into the role of NAR President following the resignation of 2024 President Tracy Kasper. As a 30-year real estate veteran from Springfield, MA, Sears is the Broker-Owner of Sears Real Estate and specializes in single-family brokerage and property management.</p><p>“I remain focused on working with NAR Interim CEO Nykia Wright and NAR’s dedicated staff to continue our critical efforts in supporting our members’ small businesses as they deliver value to their clients, strengthen their communities and promote real property rights for all,” Sears says.</p><p>Sears has served in numerous leadership positions at the local, state and national association levels, including 16 years as a member of the NAR Board of Directors and 23 years as a federal political coordinator. He also served as 2010 president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. He has been an active participant in shaping the association’s strategic direction, supporting 11 NAR committees (five as chair) and 16 working groups and PAGs (three as chair). Through this, Sears has gained a unique perspective into association operations and its advocacy work, as well as the responsibility its leaders have to support members’ ability to transact business.</p><p>“Kevin is a highly experienced Realtor, a dedicated leader and a true ambassador of the NAR brand,” Wright says. “He and I have worked closely together since my first day, and I’m looking forward to continuing to work with Kevin in his capacity as NAR president to strengthen our organization.”</p><p>Sears says he is committed to NAR’s work to advocate for the real estate industry. He has played a critical role in driving member advocacy efforts through RPAC, where he served as chair at two different times and helped to shape the Realtor Party as we know it today. “We must continue our best-in-class advocacy efforts for our industry, customers and clients to ensure they can freely buy, sell, lease and transfer real property,” Sears says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Last year, more than 110 HGAR members attended Lobby Day, which represented one-third of the total turnout of the entire New York State Association of Realtors in Albany. With two busloads of Realtors, HGAR came out in force and that effort was recognized. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! I hope you had a restful and happy holiday. Now, with the holidays behind us and dozens of New Year’s resolutions still to be abandoned, it’s time to get back to work.</p><p>2024 is going to be a transformative year for everyone—especially for Realtors. The question we all need to ask ourselves is if we will be transformed by others or will we choose to craft our own definition for ourselves and our communities. Specifically, we need to show our political leaders, our clients and the general public what it means to be a Realtor. If we decide to take that narrative, then we have a lot of good trouble to make. The good news is that 2024 will provide nothing but opportunities for each and every HGAR member.</p><p>So, let’s get to work! NYSAR Lobby Day is early this year! Due to scheduling issues and the availability of New York State Senators and Assemblymembers, Lobby Day has been moved from late April to March 27th.</p><p>Last year, more than 110 HGAR members attended Lobby Day, which represented one-third of the total turnout of the entire New York State Association of Realtors in Albany. With two busloads of Realtors, HGAR came out in force and that effort was recognized. This year, we plan to repeat the feat and show up again. We will have the buses ready with goodie bags and a happy hour for when you get home from a well-fought day in the state’s capital.</p><p>Yet, this year, unlike last year, is an election year for our State Representatives. This provides an opportunity for our advocacy efforts to really sink in. We will surely be fighting against some version of “Good Cause Eviction,” lifting the ban on solicitous phone calls and advocating for other housing-related issues. Keep an eye out for the governor’s State of the State legislative initiatives, but, in the meantime, the battle lines for each Realtor have already been drawn.</p><p>We do not need to wait for the governor to outline the legislative agenda. Even without a legislative agenda, each and every Realtor needs to advocate on behalf of themselves to our leaders and the public. At the moment, the national news about NAR is driving how the public perceives our profession, which includes our elected officials in Albany. This Lobby Day was always going to be important, but it is imperative that we use our time to tell our elected officials that we are more than just a profession defined by negative and in some cases misleading headlines. HGAR members are home providers and valued community members who promote growth, equity and ethics.</p><p>Lobby Day is one of the most important dates on the HGAR calendar. This year it will be held earlier than ever. Mark your calendars for March 27th for a day filled with advocacy and civics. Buses will be leaving from both the White Plains and Goshen offices on March 27th, and there will be an RPAC event the night before in Albany. Keep an eye out for more information and let’s hit the ground running.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past several years significant headway has been made in the area of Co-op Disclosure legislation in various areas in New York State, and particularly in Westchester County. While similar co-op transparency legislation has been introduced in New York City and at the state level, those measures have yet to be enacted.</p><p>Recently, the decision in <em>Stromberg v East River Housing Corp.</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3HkWDPs">https://bit.ly/3HkWDPs</a>] brings to light some of the issues that exist with regard to the co-op approval process and the restrictions that burden purchasers and sellers in co-op transactions. This article will review the decision in <em>Stromberg</em>, revisit some of the key requirements under the Westchester Co-op Transparency legislation, and discuss the state of the legislation introduced in New York City and at the state level.</p><h3 id="stromberg-v-east-river-housing-corp"><strong><em>Stromberg v. East River Housing Corp.</em></strong></h3><p>In Stromberg, the plaintiffs owned shares in a residential cooperative apartment building located in Manhattan and were lessees under the proprietary lease for their apartment. One of the defendants is East River Housing Corporation, which operates through its Board of Directors. Another individual defendant named in the lawsuit was the Board's vice president, Shulie Wollman, who was also the general manager of another named defendant, Cooperative Village Management, East River’s management company. The plaintiffs sued the defendants “claiming that defendants improperly and arbitrarily refused consent to a proposed sale of plaintiffs’ apartment.” The defendants counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for “declaratory relief” and reimbursement of legal fees.</p><h3 id="the-facts-of-stromberg"><strong>The Facts of <em>Stromberg</em></strong></h3><p>The plaintiffs entered into a contract of sale in January 2022 for the sale of the co-op apartment for the sale price of $520,000. The price was based on an appraisal obtained by the plaintiffs from “a disinterested third-party appraisal service. The appraisal service valued the unit at $525,000. The appraisal was based, in part, on comparable properties in the area that were sold for $514,500-$528,000.” The plaintiffs and purchaser submitted the purchase application to the Board, which was rejected. The plaintiffs “appealed to the Board to change its mind, but the Board did not do so.”</p><p>The plaintiffs’ real estate broker then asked the Management Company if the “Board would approve the sale with an increased sales price.” According to the facts of the case, the parties amended the contract purchase price and increased it to $540,000, however, the Management Company indicated that the “amended purchase price ‘was still too low’ and that ‘the Board would not approve a sale with a purchase price lower than $600,000.00.’’’ The purchaser ultimately cancelled the contract because the Co-op Corporation did not provide the approval within the “reasonable” time frame as required under the contract. The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit against the defendants, suing them for the following claims: (1) a breach-of-contract claim against East River and the Board, (2) a breach-of-fiduciary-duty claim against the Board, (3) an aiding-and-abetting claim against the Management Company, and (4) an unreasonable-restraint-of-alienation claim against the Board.</p><p>In April 2023, while motions were pending, the plaintiffs entered into a new contract of sale with a new purchaser for a purchase price in excess of $600,000. A new sale application was submitted to the Board. In May 2023, the Management Company and the Board required the plaintiff and the new purchaser to submit an amended application and requested additional information relating to the finances of the purchaser.</p><p>As a result of the additional demands made by the defendants relating to the new application, the plaintiffs believed that these actions were being made in retaliation because the plaintiffs had filed the lawsuit. The plaintiffs then amended their complaint to include an allegation of an “additional breach-of-fiduciary-duty against the Board for its alleged retaliation with respect to the April 2023 sales application, and an aiding-and-abetting claim against Wollman.”</p><p>The defendants filed two counterclaims against the plaintiffs. One counterclaim “seeks a declaratory judgment that the Board may properly consider an apartment's proposed sale price when determining whether to grant or refuse consent to a sale of the apartment's shares and lease.” The second counterclaim “seeks an award of attorney fees under the proprietary lease.” The plaintiffs, in their answer, raised “the affirmative defense that the lease's attorney-fee provision is unenforceable as unconscionable to the extent that it ‘require[s] reimbursement of the Lessor's professional fees and disbursements in a legal action brought by Lessee against Lessor based on Lessor['s] default.’”&nbsp;</p><h3 id="breach-of-contract-claim-in-stromberg-and-the-business-judgement-rule"><strong>Breach of Contract Claim in <em>Stromberg</em><br>And the Business Judgement Rule</strong></h3><p>In connection with the plaintiffs’ claim that East River and the Board “breached the co-op's governing documents and acted contrary to applicable law by failing to approve plaintiffs’ application,” the defendants claimed that their denial was in compliance with and protected by the “business judgment rule,” which “protects its ‘good faith, rational decision to withhold consent to the 2022 application based on the proposed sale price for that unit.” The court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss based on this argument.</p><h3 id="the-%E2%80%98business-judgment-rule-based-on-the-value-of-co-op-apartment"><strong>The ‘Business Judgment Rule Based on<br>The Value of Co-Op Apartment</strong></h3><p>The court in <em>Stromberg</em>, citing a well-known New York Court of Appeals decision in <em>Levandusky v. One Fifth Avenue Apartment Corp.</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3vBHx5q">https://bit.ly/3vBHx5q</a>], explained that “under the business-judgment rule, a court may not inquire ‘into actions of corporate directors taken in good faith and in the exercise of honest judgment in the lawful and legitimate furtherance of corporate purposes.’” The court in <em>Stromberg</em> further points out that “unless there is ‘illegal discrimination, the respondent members of the board of directors of the respondent cooperative corporation have the right to withhold their approval of petitioners’ purchase for any reason or no reason.’” The “Business Judgment Rule” would not protect any Board or Cooperative Corporation against illegal discrimination, but a Board would seemingly be permitted to withhold the approval of a purchaser for “any or no reason” based on the <em>Levandusky</em> decision.</p><p>The court in <em>Stromberg</em> further points out (citing another First Department Appellate Division case, <em>Singh v. Turtle Bay Towers Corp.</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4aZcZus">https://bit.ly/4aZcZus</a>]) that it was “proper for a co-op board to reject a purchase application when ‘the decision to deny the purchase application was based upon the determination that the purchase price for the subject unit was significantly below market value.’” The decision in <em>Stromberg</em>, however, does seem to place some limitations on the broad corporate discretion espoused in the <em>Levandusky</em> and <em>Singh</em> decisions. The key distinction, and limitation, provided for in <em>Stromberg</em> is not whether a co-op board may use value as a determining factor in approving or disapproving an application, but the method or means by which the value is determined and considered by a board is important and value also cannot be the only factor.</p><h3 id="contract-rights-in-the-proprietary-lease"><strong>Contract Rights in the Proprietary Lease</strong></h3><p>The court points out that the proprietary lease for the apartment which was entered into by the plaintiffs and East River provides that “There shall be no limitation, except as specifically provided therein, on the right of the Board of Directors to grant or withhold consent to an assignment, for any or for no reason.” The court further points out that East River argues “that its decision to withhold consent was based on the fact that the 2022 application's proposed sales price for plaintiffs’ unit was lower than the prices of previous sales—not because East River set an arbitrary minimum price floor that is materially above market value.” According to the contract (i.e., Lease) terms and the Business Judgment Rule, the defendants argue that they have the right to deny the application based on the fact that the value of the subject apartment is significantly below market value.</p><p>The plaintiffs, however, claim that the “arbitrary” price of $600,000 set by East River did not accurately reflect market values and argued that their appraisal established an accurate value based on comparable sales. The plaintiffs also argue that the previous sales data relied on by the defendants was “faulty because it included the sales prices of units that [were] not comparable to plaintiffs’ unit and that this sales data did not reflect [other] sellers’ concessions, which assertedly inflated the nominal sales price of the unit without changing the post-concessions amount that [other] sellers actually received from buyers.” The plaintiffs provided the defendants with a copy of the appraisal obtained by them from an independent third-party and also submitted an affidavit to the court from their broker establishing that their limit price of $600,000 was not in line with market values, and argued that other factors were not taken into account by the Board when setting this price threshold and denying the purchaser’s application.</p><h3 id="court%E2%80%99s-ruling-regarding-the-co-op%E2%80%99s-determination"><strong>Court’s Ruling Regarding the Co-op’s Determination</strong></h3><p>Ultimately, with respect to the issue relating to the denial of the plaintiffs’ and purchaser’s application, the defendants were seeking a declaratory judgment establishing that they may “consider the apartment’s sale price in determining whether to grant or withhold consent to the Prior Application.” The court points out that plaintiffs were not disputing whether the co-op Board could “consider the purchase price; rather, [the plaintiffs] contend[ed] it cannot be the sole criterion considered in approving or denying an application and plaintiffs allege[d] that East River abused its discretion by considering only whether the sale price satisfied an arbitrary price floor unrelated to the unit's market value.” The court agreed with the plaintiffs and provided that “the only question is whether the particular manner in which East River considered the unit's sales price was legally impermissible.”</p><p>The court ultimately denied the defendant’s request for a declaratory judgment and dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim, and ordered that the lawsuit must proceed at trial with respect to these open issues. The court’s holding seems to place additional restrictions on a co-op board’s fairly broad discretion to make decisions “for any or no reason” under the guise of the Business Judgment Rule. It will be important to follow this case carefully to see what ultimately is decided.</p><h3 id="are-legal-fees-recoverable-by-the-co-op-in-an-action-brought-by-an-owner"><strong>Are Legal Fees Recoverable by the Co-op<br>In an Action Brought by an Owner?</strong></h3><p>The decision in <em>Stromberg</em> also provides important guidance with respect to attorney fee provisions in contracts and proprietary leases. In Stromberg, the court points out that the proprietary lease provides as follows: “‘in connection with any action or proceeding brought by the Lessee against the Lessor that is based on any other matter or thing relating to the lease or to East River's ‘Bylaws, Certificate of Incorporation, House Rules, or regulations duly adopted by the Board of Directors, the lessee must pay East River's fees.” The defendants in Stromberg filed a motion for summary judgment establishing that they were entitled to legal fees from the plaintiff based on the above-cited provision. The plaintiffs, as an affirmative defense, argued “that the attorney fees provision in the lease is unenforceable as unconscionable.” The court agreed and dismissed the defendants’ claim for reimbursement of legal fees.</p><p>The court cited another First Department decision in <em>Krodel v Amalgamated Dwellings Inc.</em>, which “held that a proprietary lease provision requiring the lessee to pay the co-op’s legal fees incurred in connection with an action brought by the lessee against the co-op, which relates to the lease ‘or to any alleged failure by the lessor to perform any act which the lessor is required to perform’ is unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.” The court pointed out that the reasoning in <em>Krodel</em> provided that the enforcement of “such a provision would produce an unjust result because it would dissuade aggrieved parties from pursuing litigation and preclude tenant-shareholders from making meaningful decisions about how to vindicate their rights in legitimate instances of landlord default.” The court in <em>Stromberg</em>, therefore, held that the attorney-fee provision would be unenforceable under the <em>Krodel</em> decision.</p><h3 id="westchester-co-op-disclosure-legislation-revisited"><strong>Westchester Co-Op Disclosure Legislation Revisited</strong></h3><p>The decision in <em>Stromberg</em> seems to provide a limited expansion of an owner’s and purchaser’s rights in connection with the sale and transfer of a cooperative apartment, and a limitation of the broad discretion of co-op boards when denying a co-op purchase application. While we will need to wait to see what the ultimate resolution is in Stromberg, several counties (i.e., Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Nassau and Suffolk) have been successful in passing co-op transparency and disclosure legislation.</p><p>In Westchester County, the co-op transparency and disclosure laws passed in 2018 and amended in 2021 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4aZ1AuA">https://bit.ly/4aZ1AuA</a>], afford owners and purchasers significant protections. The Westchester County Fair Housing Law requires co-op corporations to “adhere to certain time frames and report rejections to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3RQzyJa">https://bit.ly/3RQzyJa</a>]. The amendment passed in 2021 also now requires the co-op corporation to provide a reason for the denial to a purchaser. Important provisions are outlined by the Human Rights Commission in its informational flyer, which should be reviewed and utilized by all real estate professionals [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3RQzyJa">https://bit.ly/3RQzyJa</a>]. The flyer provides details on application requirements, rejection notice requirements (as well as providing forms of the Model Rejection Form [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3u2Fwi2">https://bit.ly/3u2Fwi2</a>] and a completed one [see <a href="https://bit.ly/48Kv6CM">https://bit.ly/48Kv6CM</a>] for reference purposes), critical deadlines, fair housing training requirements for co-op board members, and a list of fines for non-compliance.</p><p>The Human Rights Commission informational flyer also points out that Westchester County’s Fair Housing Law “requires cooperative housing corporations that have minimum financial qualifications to disclose those qualifications in their applications. Section 700.21-a (A)(2)(b), however, states in relevant part:</p><p><em>If a cooperative housing corporation does not have stated mandatory minimum financial qualifications the [cooperative must at least disclose its] preferred minimum income, total assets, and credit score, and preferred maximum debt-to-income ratio and percentage of purchase price being financed, noting that these criteria may vary in the discretion of the governing board weighing these factors when it makes a decision on an application.”</em></p><p>The FHL also makes clear that a co-op board does retain the “discretion” to consider and weigh the factors they set in connection with the required minimum financial qualifications if the co-op does not have any in place.</p><h3 id="legislative-initiatives-to-track-in-2024-new-york-state-and-new-york-city"><strong>Legislative Initiatives to Track in 2024: <br>New York State and New York City</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;There has also been proposed legislation introduced in New York City (Int. 0915-2023) and in the New York State (NYS Assembly Bill No. A02685) level relating to co-op transparency and disclosure obligations, but these laws have yet to be passed. [See <em>Co-op Transactions: Unmasking Hidden Discrimination</em>, National Association of Realtors at <a href="https://bit.ly/3HjxBQB">https://bit.ly/3HjxBQB</a> and reprinted in<em> Real Estate In-Depth]</em>. It will be important to keep track of the progress of these legislative initiatives in 2024 as well as developments in the <em>Stromberg</em> case, as they will possibly expand the protections afforded to purchasers and owners with respect to co-op transactions.</p><p><em>The foregoing article is for informational purposes only and does not confer an attorney-client relationship and shall not be considered legal advice.

    <description><![CDATA[Housing costs in New York City and the surrounding suburbs have grown more than 68% over the last decade, the largest increase among selected major metropolitan areas in the U.S.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—Housing costs in New York City and the surrounding suburbs have grown more than 68% over the last decade, the largest increase among selected major metropolitan areas in the U.S., according to a new report from New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli released on Jan. 12.</p><p>“Housing costs in New York City and the surrounding suburbs have risen dramatically over the last decade,” DiNapoli said. “When we look at other major U.S. metropolitan areas, we see New York’s housing costs have grown at a greater rate. More than half of tenants in the city spend 30% of their income on rent, forcing them to make tough choices. City and state leaders recognize New York’s housing affordability problem but need to implement cost-effective solutions more quickly.”</p><p>Since 2011, housing costs, which include shelter (mortgage payments, rent and property taxes), utilities, operations/maintenance, and furnishings reached an all-time high in the New York City metro area, which includes the city as well as Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland counties. In 2021-2022 homeowners or renters spent an average of $30,300 on housing costs, only trailing the San Francisco and Seattle metro areas, reflecting 40% of their total household expenses, compared to 34% nationally.</p><h3 id="renters-most-burdened-by-housing-costs"><strong>Renters Most Burdened by Housing Costs</strong></h3><p><br>One million tenants or 53% of households spent over 30% of their income on rent in 2021, which has remained significantly high over the last decade. In Brooklyn and Queens, a greater share of moderate- and middle-income households in 2021 spent more than 50% of their income on rent than in 2011.</p><p>After a dip in 2020, rents rose in 2021 and 2022, and more people in New York City fell behind on their payments. In June 2021, 26% of rental households in the metro area were behind on rent, greater than almost 15% nationally.</p><p>While the largest share of households that fell behind on rent were low-income, 22% of moderate-income households on Staten Island and 8% of middle-income households in Brooklyn also fell behind. As of October 2023, 18% of city residents were behind on rent, compared to 12% nationally. Over the last two years, missed rent payments have risen among New York City Housing Authority property residents as NYCHA collected only 61% of rent as of November 2023.</p><h3 id="economic-headwinds-restrict-supply"><strong>Economic Headwinds Restrict Supply</strong></h3><p>A halt in construction during the pandemic, a lapsing of the real estate property tax exemption program known as 421-a, and higher interest rates have all contributed to a slowdown in housing development.&nbsp; DiNapoli’s report noted the city has taken some action to support the development of new housing and has released proposals to create new incentives to boost production.</p><p>In 2023, the city completed almost 13,900 affordable units through the first 10 months of the year, but it has not been enough to keep up with demand. Permits for new residential buildings, which include new market-rate units, declined by 85% in the first eight months of 2023.</p><h3 id="outlook"><strong>Outlook</strong></h3><p>“The city and state continue to discuss the affordable housing crisis in New York City, making incremental steps towards an equitable solution for all,” the report stated. “Slow progress and a more difficult financing environment have made the issue more acute and pressing. Policy solutions that are cost-effective and practicable are needed quickly to jump-start the City’s housing affordability efforts, both for residents now and for the City’s long-term desirability as a hub for talent.”</p><h3 id="other-key-report-takeaways"><strong>Other Key Report Takeaways</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p>In June 2021, 26% of rental households in the New York City metropolitan area were behind on rent (15% nationally). In October 2023, it was 18%, better than before but still worse than the nation’s 12%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, over 1 million households (53%) in the city were rent burdened, spending over 30% of income on rent. As the most populous borough, Brooklyn had the greatest rent burden at 323,136 households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022, property taxes made up over 27% of homeowner costs citywide, on average, compared to 22.6% nationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vacancies were high among more expensive studio units, with 52.7% of units priced at $2,300 or more and 22.4% of those priced between $1,500 and $2,299 vacant in 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brooklyn saw the largest increase in newly completed or preserved affordable units between 2014 and 2023, fueled by a two-fold increase between 2017 and 2018, but the Bronx has added more affordable units since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2023, building permits fell by 85% in the first eight months, following a surge in activity ahead of the expiration of the 421-a program in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biggest decline in permits was among the largest multi-family buildings (100+ units), which dropped 91% in the first eight months of 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report stated that continued development of affordable housing in the Bronx may be particularly valuable to ease affordability issues in the City’s housing market. In 2021, the Bronx had the lowest net rental vacancy rate citywide at about 0.8% whereas Manhattan had the highest at more than 10.0%. The highest vacancy rates in Manhattan, as well as citywide, were among units with asking rents of $2,300 or more. Contrastingly, there were very few units with asking rents of less than $900, driving the relatively low vacancy rates in the outer boroughs and especially the Bronx.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The inventory of unsold existing homes slumped 11.5% from the previous month to 1 million at the end of December, or the equivalent of 3.2 months’ supply at the current monthly sales pace.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales retreated in December, according to a report released on Jan. 19 by the National Association of Realtors. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales slipped in the Midwest and South, rose in the West and were unchanged in the Northeast. All four regions experienced year-over-year sales decreases.</p><p>On an annual basis, existing-home sales (4.09 million) dropped to the lowest level since 1995, while the median price reached a record high of $389,800 in 2023.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—decreased 1.0% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.78 million in December. Year-over-year, sales declined 6.2% (down from 4.03 million in December 2022).</p><blockquote>“The latest month’s sales look to be the bottom before inevitably turning higher in the new year,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Mortgage rates are meaningfully lower compared to just two months ago, and more inventory is expected to appear on the market in upcoming months.”</blockquote><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of December was 1.0 million units, down 11.5% from November but up 4.2% from one year ago (960,000). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.2-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 3.5 months in November but up from 2.9 months in December 2022.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $382,600, an increase of 4.4% from December 2022 ($366,500). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><p>“Despite sluggish home sales, 85 million homeowning households enjoyed further gains in housing wealth,” Yun added. “Obviously, the recent, rapid three-year rise in home prices is unsustainable. If price increases continue at the current pace, the country could accelerate into haves and have-nots. Creating a path towards homeownership for today’s renters is essential. It requires economic and income growth and, most importantly, a steady buildup of home construction.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index"><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 29 days in December, up from 25 days in November and 26 days in December 2022. Fifty-six percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in December, down from 31% in November 2023 and December 2022. NAR’s 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 29% of transactions in December, up from 27% in November 2023 and 28% in December 2022.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in December, down from 18% in November and identical to one year ago.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in December, virtually unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates"><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.60% as of Jan. 18. That’s down from 6.66% the prior week but up from 6.15% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales"><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-Op Sales</strong></h3><p>Single-family home sales edged lower to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.4 million in December, down 0.3% from 3.41 million in November and 6.1% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $387,000 in December, up 4.0% from December 2022.</p><p>Existing condominium and co-op sales recorded a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 380,000 units in December, down 7.3% from November and one year ago (both 410,000 units). The median existing condo price was $343,800 in December, up 8.2% from the previous year ($317,700).</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown"><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>At 470,000 units, existing-home sales in the Northeast were unchanged from November but down 9.6% from December 2022.

Prices continued to rise to close out 2023, with the median sales price of homes in New York State rising 10.1% to $380,000 last month.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—As 2023 ended, inventory of homes across the Empire State fell to the lowest recorded mark in history, according to the housing report released recently by the New York State Association of Realtors.</p><p>Inventory of homes for sale across New York State dropped to an all-time record low of 24,469 units in December 2023. This represents a 17.8% decline in the 29,768 homes available in December 2022.</p><p>Prices continued to rise to close out 2023, with the median sales price of homes in New York State rising 10.1% to $380,000 last month, up from $345,000 in December 2022. This marks the fifth consecutive month of rising median sales prices, NYSAR officials reported.</p><p>Interest rates have started to come down in month-over-month comparisons. According to Freddie Mac, the average on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped from 7.44% in November 2023 to 6.82% in December. For comparison, a year ago at this time, the interest rate stood at 6.36%.</p><p>New listings and pending sales both rose slightly in December. New listings of homes were up 0.4% in year-over-year comparisons from 5,769 units in December 2022 to 5,791 homes last month.</p><p>Pending sales inched up 0.7% from 6,483 units in 2022 to 6,528 homes in December 2023. Closed sales, however, did fall, dropping 12.6% from 9,855 sales in December 2022 to only 8,611 homes to close out 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The consensus from the real estate broker panelists who participated at HGAR’s Regional Power Broker 2024 CRE Market Forecast on Jan. 24 at HGAR’s offices in White Plains was that most markets in the region will be active in 2024, with the exception of the office sector.</p><p>HGAR’s Regional Power Broker 2024 CRE Market Forecast was moderated by Bridget Gibbons, director of the Westchester County Office of Economic Development. The panel included Rand Commercial’s John Lavelle; Amit Doshi, Senior Executive Managing Director of Meridian Investment Sales; Sarah Jones Maturo, President of RM Friedland; Tom LaPerch, Associate Broker of Houlihan Lawrence Commercial; Shallini Mehra, Managing Director of Meridian Investment Sales; Adam O'Gorman, Owner of Nova North Commercial and Steven Salomone, Associate Broker with Houlihan Lawrence Commercial.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/CID-0124--4-.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/CID-0124--4-.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/CID-0124--4-.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/CID-0124--4-.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/CID-0124--4-.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Adam O'Gorman of Nova North Commercial, John Lavelle of Rand Commercial and Steven Salamone of Houlihan Lawrence Commercial. - PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</span></figcaption></figure><p>The various panelists agreed that the office market remains troubled although there is a movement to have workers return to the office more frequently and therefore reduce at-home policies. The trend of converting outdated office buildings to other uses, including housing, will continue, they said. Brokers contend that companies will be attracted to Class A-type office space, while properties rated at either B or C will have trouble attracting tenants, with some B-C properties being taken over by their lenders.</p><p>While still strong, many expect multifamily development to slow down as a significant amount of new product comes online in major metro markets.</p><p>The most upbeat of the broker forecasts was definitely Rand Commercial’s John Lavelle, who shared that Orange County’s industrial real estate market was strong in 2023 and is expected to remain that way this year.</p><p>“Quite frankly, business has been good the past few years. We have done very well, thankfully. Clearly far and away, the most active sector of the Orange County commercial real estate market is the industrial market.”</p><p>He continued, “In 2023 alone we had 3 million square feet of warehouse buildings under construction. That’s a really good year for us.”</p><p>Lavelle noted that of the 3 million square feet being built, a total of 2.4 million square feet are already leased or spoken for. While nationwide, approximately 25% of industrial space in development is pre-leased, Orange County’s rate is approximately 60%.</p><p>He said that industrial rents have “skyrocketed” in Orange County. Until recently, industrial rents in the county were stable at about $8 triple-net, per-square-foot. “We are now seeing very commonly rents in the $12 to $13 range and in 2023 and I know of two warehouse transactions where the rent was $14-a-square-foot,” Lavelle said. “Our rents are appreciating, although we are not as expensive as the rest of the (regional) market, so there is still opportunity.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/CID-0124--3-.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/CID-0124--3-.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/CID-0124--3-.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/CID-0124--3-.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/CID-0124--3-.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Panel Moderator Bridget Gibbons - PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another sector of the industrial market that is experiencing price appreciation is the value of land. Lavelle informed the HGAR CID gathering that developable industrial land parcels were selling for some time at $10 a buildable foot. In the last couple of years, land values rose to $20 a buildable foot and in some cases more than $30 a buildable foot. He related that two industrial land deals in Orange County last year netted $40 a buildable foot.</p><p>He noted that while in many markets of the country, there is little industrial land available and intense competition for the available properties, Orange County is bucking that trend.</p><p>“In Orange County, New York right now there are over 14 million square feet of new industrial sites being engineered and approved,” Lavelle revealed. He added that the significant industrial pipeline in Orange County represents “the fact that there aren’t any other sites left. That is every piece of dirt we got.” He said that 14 million square feet of industrial space in the pipeline represents approximately 20 years of approved sites (based on the normal 500,000 square feet of annual absorption) in the county.</p><p>In his predictions for 2024, Lavelle related that the Orange County industrial market “will continue to crank.” He said he was aware of at least 2 million square feet of new deals that have not closed as yet that are in the pipeline in 2024, in addition to the new development under construction.</p><p>With the 14 million square feet of potential new product in the pipeline, Lavelle wonders whether some of the national industrial real estate investment firms and property flippers that own product or land in the county will have the “staying power to carry those sites until they are sold. And if they don’t there will be some really cheap opportunities in the market,” he related.</p><p>Lavelle concluded his remarks by saying he expects industrial rents to continue to rise and he hopes that land values will begin to stabilize in 2024 in Orange County.</p><p>Some of the other major takeaways from the event included:</p><p>Meridian’s Doshi said that land values and investment sales were down approximately 50% last year in Manhattan. “I don’t see any light coming up in the near future,” he said. “Maybe it’s the rent laws, maybe it’s the legislation that the politicians are enacting.”</p><p>Doshi and Mehr reported that investment activity is brisk in the Bronx. He noted that multifamily values have soared from approximately $100,000 a door (unit) to $225,000 a door. Mehr noted that rent-stabilized properties are under water and not worth the amount of debt on the building. Affordable properties are also performing well in today’s market.</p><p>She pointed to the South Bronx as a market of opportunity in 2024 and beyond. Despite the lack of the 421a incentive, there are between 20 to 30 projects under construction that will bring approximately 5,000 units of mixed-income housing to the market.</p><p>She noted that the average multifamily rent in Manhattan is $4,300, in Brooklyn it is $3,500 and the Queens average is more than $3,000 a month. In the South Bronx, the average rent is $2,900 and most properties offer attractive amenities, water views and a 15-minute train commute to Manhattan,</p><p>Segments in the multifamily sector (non-rent-stabilized properties) performed very well. The industrial market was also very active, until e-commerce sales began to slow, Doshi noted.</p><p>He said that Class A office buildings in New York City did very well in 2023, while lower-rated B and C buildings saw little activity.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/CID-0124--2-.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/CID-0124--2-.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/CID-0124--2-.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/CID-0124--2-.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/01/CID-0124--2-.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The CID program drew a standing-room-only crowd. - PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</span></figcaption></figure><p>RM Friedland’s Maturo termed the year-to-year winners in overall growth in respect to leasing was the industrial sector in the Westchester County market with an availability rate of approximately 6%. The average asking rent has hit a new record of $19.06-per-square-foot. The only asset type that saw an increase in sales volume in 2023 as compared to a year earlier was the retail market due in large part to the amount of cash deals that closed. The retail market, fueled by the sale of some Class A assets, saw an increase of 12% in value to $380-per-square-foot, she noted.</p><p>Nova North’s O’Gorman reported that office leasing in Rockland County grew 10.5% in 2024 as compared to a year earlier. He said that the leasing volume was fueled in large part (76.5%) by deals of less than 2,000 square feet and many businesses that were looking to shrink their office footprints. He said that retail leasing in Rockland County grew by approximately 5.6%.</p><p>Houlihan Lawrence’s LaPerch and Salomone said that in the Putnam-Dutchess County markets, retail space has been repurposed for recreational uses, including for popular Pickleball facilities. In addition, restaurants are making a comeback after Covid. Other areas of growth they say are in the medical space and some segments of the office market as more companies put limitations on work-at-home policies and demand employees work out of the office a majority of the work week.</p><p>Sponsors of the CID event were: NYSCAR Hudson Valley, Ten-X, Houlihan Lawrence Commercial, Ecuadane and C2G Environmental.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors released earlier today (Jan. 26) pending home sales data and its economic forecast for 2024 in which it projects that existing home sales will increase 13% as compared to 2023.</p><p>NAR reported that pending existing-home sales in December rose 8.3%. The Midwest, South and West posted monthly gains in transactions while the Northeast recorded a loss. The Midwest, South and West also registered year-over-year increases while the Northeast had a decline in transactions compared to last year.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index increased to 77.3 in December. Year-over-year, pending transactions were up 1.3%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“The housing market is off to a good start this year, as consumers benefit from falling mortgage rates and stable home prices,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Job additions and income growth will further help with housing affordability, but increased supply will be essential to satisfying all potential demand.”</p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown"><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The Northeast PHSI dropped 3.0% from last month to 62.3, a decline of 3.9% from December 2022. The Midwest index increased 5.6% to 80.5 in December, up 4.3% from one year ago.</p><p>The South PHSI jumped 11.9% to 93.0 in December, rising 1.5% from the prior year. The West index surged 14.0% in December to 61.0, up 1.5% from December 2022.</p><h3 id="nar-quarterly-us-economic-forecast"><strong>NAR Quarterly U.S. Economic Forecast</strong></h3><p>NAR’s Economic Outlook as of January 2024, projects a 13% increase in existing-home sales in 2024 (from 2023) to 4.62 million and a 15.8% increase in 2025 (from 2024) to 5.35 million. The annual median home price is expected to rise 1.4% to $395,100 in 2024, and then increase 2.6% to $405,200 in 2025.</p><p>“Home sales are projected to rise significantly in each of the next two years as the market steadily returns to normal sales activity,” Yun noted.</p><p>The Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates four times. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce along the 6% to 7% range for most of the year, he stated.</p><p>NAR forecasts that due to sizable growth in apartment construction over the past three years, rent growth will calm, which will help bring consumer price inflation to less than 3% in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS reported earlier today (Jan. 26) a 2.10% increase in closed median sale price between 2022 and 2023.</p><p>OneKey MLS, which aggregates statistics on residential real estate transactions across urban, suburban, and rural geographies, covering New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson Valley, reported a regional closed median sale price of $602,500, representing a 2.10% increase as compared to $590,000 reported over the same period in 2022. In 2023, closed sales transactions decreased 23.10%, from 63,443 closed sales transactions in 2022 to 48,817 in 2023. Pending sales transactions decreased 12.90%, from 58,163 in 2022 to 50,683 in 2023.</p><p>For the month of December 2023, OneKey MLS reported a regional closed median sale price of $625,000, a 9.60% increase from $570,000, the closed median sale price reported in the month of December 2022. In a month-over-month comparison of closed median sale price, the closed median sale price rose less than 1.00% from the figure reported in November 2023, $619,500. Closed sales transactions decreased 15.00% in December 2023 in a year-over-year comparison from 3,270 in December 2022 to 4,406 in December 2023. Month-over-month closed sales transactions reportedly decreased 4.20% from 3,909 in November 2023.</p><p>Year-over-year, pending sales transactions reportedly increased 2.40% from 3,270 in December 2022 to 3,348 in December 2023.

This may be an indication that the New York regional area may be in line with the experts’ expectation of increasing national transactional activity in 2024.</p><p>In respect to national home sales in December 2023, NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun said, “The latest month’s sales look to be the bottom before inevitably turning higher in the new year.

    <description><![CDATA[NAR’s view is that all relevant cases should be included in any consolidation (including buyer and seller cases), and the Northern District of Illinois is best placed to address the industrywide issues these cases present.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, plaintiffs in some of the ongoing antitrust lawsuits concerning broker commissions filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, asking the panel to centralize and transfer various cases to the federal court in the Western District of Missouri, where the Sitzer/Burnett case was tried.</p><p>The National Association of Realtors, which filed its response to that motion on Jan. 23, supports centralizing 19 currently pending commission lawsuits but disagrees with plaintiffs’ arguments that it would be most efficient to transfer the cases to the Western District of Missouri. Instead, NAR believes the best venue to hear the pending lawsuits is the federal court in the Northern District of Illinois.</p><p>Centralizing cases with overlapping factual issues into a single multidistrict litigation can create a more efficient legal process that avoids inconsistent rulings and conserves the courts’ and parties’ resources. NAR’s view is that all relevant cases should be included in any consolidation (including buyer and seller cases), and the Northern District of Illinois is best placed to address the industrywide issues these cases present. NAR believes that the Northern District of Illinois is the most appropriate place for these cases to be transferred for several reasons, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>It is the district in which the original commission cases were filed and remain pending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the only district with both buyer and seller cases pending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the district with the largest number of cases pending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NAR headquarters—and, therefore, much of the discovery related to these cases—is in the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The district has experience with NAR rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chicago is a central location that is easily accessible for all parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NAR also says it would not oppose the cases being transferred to the Eastern District of Texas, where the cases with the largest number of defendants are pending.</p><p>NAR’s proposal is different from what the moving plaintiffs’ attorneys have requested. Plaintiffs have asked that some—but not all—cases be consolidated in the Western District of Missouri. NAR opposes the moving plaintiffs’ proposal because, among other reasons stated in the filing, it would result in multiple parallel proceedings and defeat the purposes of consolidation.</p><p>The JPML will issue its decision after it hears arguments on these cases, which is expected to occur in late March.</p><p>NAR recognizes that the outcome of the pending cases could have a significant impact on the real estate industry, which employs around 1.5 million people and represents approximately 17% of the country’s GDP. NAR remains committed to supporting any association that is named in a copycat lawsuit.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—New York Attorney General Letitia James announced earlier today (Feb. 5) an agreement with real estate broker Pasquale Marciano and his companies, Century 21 Marciano, Anthony Marciano Real Estate Inc., and New Roc Property Management to stop what the Attorney General’s office described as illegal policies that denied housing opportunities to low-income renters.</p><p>The Office of the Attorney General, with assistance from the Housing Rights Initiative, found that real estate agents, who Marciano oversees, violated local and state laws by refusing to rent apartments to investigators who indicated that they intended to use a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher to pay rent. As part of the agreement with OAG, Marciano, who owns 13 multifamily rental properties throughout New Rochelle with a total of 76 units, must place nine tenants using Section 8 or other government housing subsidies in units he owns and pay $40,000 to the state, among other actions to make housing more accessible for low-income renters.</p><p>“Discrimination against low-income New Yorkers denies opportunities to those most in need of housing assistance,” said Attorney General James. “This agreement will open up housing specifically for low-income New Yorkers and send a clear message that this kind of discrimination is unacceptable in our communities. I want to thank the Housing Rights Initiative for their help with this investigation and consistent work to fight housing discrimination.”</p><p>Refusing to rent to prospective tenants based on their source of income is illegal discrimination under New York law, and wrongly denies New Yorkers equal access to housing. Owners, landlords, property managers, rental agents, and brokers cannot refuse to accept potential tenants solely because they receive housing subsidies. Government-issued rental vouchers, such as the Section 8 Housing Choice voucher program, provide housing assistance to the lowest-income households to rent decent, safe housing in the private market. These programs also aid senior citizens and disabled persons on fixed incomes, displaced families, and homeless individuals with disabilities, according to the Attorney General’s office.</p><p>At the time of the investigation, Marciano, as the owner and head real estate broker at Century 21 Marciano, oversaw the rental leasing practices of more than 25 real estate sales agents representing Westchester landlords seeking to rent apartments. An investigation done by HRI revealed that Century 21 Marciano enforced a policy that prohibited Section 8 holders from submitting applications for rental units. Century 21 Marciano agents specifically told investigators that the units they inquired about did not accept Section 8 vouchers because they “preferred not to”—a violation of state and local antidiscrimination laws. According to court documents, the investigation into Century 21 Marciano’s activities began in January 2019 and lasted until the date of the agreement—Jan. 12, 2024.</p><p>Under the agreement with OAG, Marciano and any customer-facing staff member at his companies must undergo antidiscrimination training. Marciano must also implement an anti-discrimination policy and distribute it to everyone involved in the rental process at his companies. Rental applications must include clear anti-discrimination statements containing the sentence, “We are happy to consider applicants who have housing vouchers or subsidies.” Additionally, Marciano must publicly advertise all vacant units and include that government housing vouchers, such as Section 8, are accepted on every rental listing. Finally, Marciano must ensure that rental application fees are capped at the $20 maximum and, during the five-year period of the agreement, must also waive broker fees for any applicants seeking to use a government housing subsidy for their rental.</p><p>Attorney General James has consistently taken action to fight housing discrimination and protect low-income tenants. In October 2023, Attorney General James took action against another Westchester property owner and manager for discriminating against low-income renters. In 2022, Attorney General James took action to stop “tenant blacklisting” and partnered with HRI to stop the real estate company Compass from denying housing to low-income New Yorkers. In July 2022, Attorney General James recovered nearly $300,000 of illegally withheld security deposits for Brooklyn tenants. In April 2022, Attorney General James sued Brooklyn-based eviction lawyers for engaging in deceptive rent collection practices and initiating frivolous lawsuits against New York tenants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Approximately 250 colleagues, association executives and well-wishers were on hand for the 2024 Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Installation Gala on Feb. 1 to celebrate the installation of Carmen Bauman as the 2024 HGAR President and the swearing-in of the association’s 2024 Executive Officers and Directors.</p><p>The gala held at the opulent Opus Westchester in Downtown White Plains was themed “Stronger Together.” After her installation, officiated by OneKey MLS Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty, 2024 HGAR President Bauman, Associate Broker with commercial real estate brokerage firm RM Friedland, stressed that during her term she will be seeking increased participation by the membership to help HGAR grow even stronger.</p><p>Bauman is the first Chinese American to serve as association president. In addition, she is the first commercial real estate broker to serve as HGAR President since 1997. Bauman served as President-Elect in 2023. Previously, she served as Treasurer of the Board of Directors in 2022 and has been a member of the HGAR Board since 2019. In 2023, she served on HGAR’s Global Business Council, Legislative Committee and Young Professionals Network.</p><p>“This year you will hear me speak about ‘Stronger Together’ because that is what we are. We are stronger together,” Bauman told the Installation Gala event gathering. “We should stand together now more than ever, rise together. The Realtor collective can and will remain strong. So, I would ask each and every one of you to raise your glass and let’s have a toast—here’s to evolution not revolution. Here’s to the Realtor family.”</p><p>&nbsp;Bauman, who is also an attorney, stated earlier that in 2024 she will be asking each HGAR member “to step out of your comfort zone and explore some uncharted territories—get involved with the association if you have never been involved before or get even more involved if you’re already engaged.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Carmen---family.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="523" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Carmen---family.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Carmen---family.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Carmen with her parents and sons.</span></figcaption></figure><p>A poignant part of the program was when Bauman’s sons Jake and Sebastian led the assemblage in the Pledge of Allegiance.</p><p>The program also featured the installation of the HGAR Board of Directors by HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez and the installation of the 2024 Executive Officers by 2024 NYSAR President Joe Rivellino.</p><p>The 2024 HGAR Executive Officers installed include: Vlora Sejdi of HomeSmart Homes &amp; Estates in White Plains as President-Elect; Joseph Lippolis of BHHS Rivertowns Real Estate in Peekskill as Treasurer; Rey Hollingsworth Falu of Hollingsworth Real Estate Group in White Plains as Secretary, and Tony D’Anzica of Dynamax Realty NYC Inc. in Manhattan as Immediate Past President.</p><p>“We are so excited to welcome Carmen Bauman as our 2024 Association President.&nbsp; She offers a wealth of knowledge as an attorney, commercial and residential broker, and will be a dynamic leader,” said HGAR CEO Fernandez, who participated in her first Installation Gala since taking over as association CEO in September 2023. “We are also very fortunate to have such a diverse and vibrant group of 2024 directors from throughout the Hudson Valley and New York City who are dedicated to advancing HGAR’s strategic vision.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/EXECUTIVE-TEAM-INSTALLED.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/EXECUTIVE-TEAM-INSTALLED.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/EXECUTIVE-TEAM-INSTALLED.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/EXECUTIVE-TEAM-INSTALLED.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/EXECUTIVE-TEAM-INSTALLED.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Vlora Sejdi, Rey Hollingsworth Falu, Joseph Lippolis and Tony D’Anzica were installed as the HGAR 2024 Executive Board by Joe Rivellino, President of the New York State Association of Realtors.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>HGAR’s 2024 Regional Directors include Joseph Cosentino of Morris Park Realty Group in the Bronx as Bronx County Regional Director; Carole McCann of Hudson Heritage Realty in Washingtonville as Orange County Regional Director; Lee Presser of Exp Realty NYC in Manhattan as New York County Regional Director; Jennifer Rousset of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty in New City as Rockland County Regional Director; Aaron Velez of Houlihan Lawrence in Somers as Putnam County Regional Director; and Crystal Hawkins-Syska of Keller Williams New York Realty in White Plains as Westchester County Regional Director.</p><p>Additional HGAR 2024 Directors installed were Emran Bhuiyan of EXIT Realty Premium, Bronx; Timothy Bohlke of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, Suffern; Layla Boyles of Century 21 Realty Center, Monroe; Anthony Domathoti of Exit Realty Premium, Bronx; Mackenzie Forsberg of Genesis Realty Group LLC, Bronx; Ron Garafalo of John J.

    <description><![CDATA[Certified communities include locations in Long Island, the Mid-Hudson, Central New York, Western New York, Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier, North Country, and Capital regions.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—As part of her efforts to significantly boost housing development in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Feb. 7 that 20 communities in the state have been certified as “Pro-Housing Communities” that will have a leg up on other applicants for up to $650 million in state discretionary funding.</p><p>Among the certified communities include locations in Long Island, the Mid-Hudson, Central New York, Western New York, Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier, North Country, and Capital regions. A total of seven communities in the Mid-Hudson were certified: the Village of Croton-on-Hudson; the City of Kingston; the City of New Rochelle; the City of Newburgh, the City of Poughkeepsie; the town of Red Hook and the City of White Plains. The only other location in the New York metro region to secure certification was the Village of Mineola in Nassau County.</p><p>“These 20 communities—and more than 60 others who have started their applications—are taking a stand to build a better, more prosperous, and more affordable future for New York,” Gov. Hochul said. “The only way to solve the housing crisis is to build hundreds of thousands of new homes, and through the Pro-Housing Communities program, my administration is continuing to put its full-fledged support, including up to $650 million, behind communities that are serious about housing growth.”</p><p>Last year the governor signed an Executive Order to establish the Pro-Housing Community Program in order to recognize and reward municipalities actively working to unlock their housing potential and encourage others to follow suit. Localities that have successfully unlocked housing growth or committed to taking important steps to support housing, such as by streamlining permitting and adopting pro-housing policies, and that have applied and submitted critical housing and zoning data to the state, will receive a certification from New York State Homes and Community Renewal that will make them eligible for $650 million in state discretionary funding.</p><p>The discretionary funding programs include: the Downtown Revitalization Initiative, administered by the Department of State;  NY Forward, administered by the Department of State;  Regional Council Capital Fund, administrated by Empire State Development;  New York Main Street, administered by New York State Homes and Community Renewal; &nbsp; Market New York capital grants, administered by Empire State Development; &nbsp; Long Island Investment Fund, administered by Empire State Development; &nbsp; Mid-Hudson Momentum Fund, administered by Empire State Development; and &nbsp; Public Transportation Modernization Enhancement Program, administrated by the Department of Transportation </p><p>Localities who submit documentation that their housing stock has increased by 1% in the previous year or 3% over the previous three years (downstate) or by 0.33% in the last year or 1% over the previous three years (upstate) will qualify for the certification. Communities that have not yet seen housing growth can also achieve Pro-Housing Community designation by passing a resolution stating their commitment to Pro-Housing principles along with submitting the required housing and zoning data, state officials noted.</p><p>The Homes and Community Renewal is reviewing program applications on a rolling basis and will provide approval or denial within 90 days of submission.</p><p>The governor called the officials of the 20 certified communities “the visionaries, you're the leaders. I want to give you all a round of applause. And not just you 20, but—the numbers keep rolling in literally by the hour—we have another 60 plus communities that have already said they have sent us a letter of intent and we're going to process them very quickly.”</p><p>Among the officials from the Hudson Valley at the roundtable with the governor included Kingston Mayor Steve Noble, Poughkeepsie Mayor Yvonne Flowers and Croton-on-Hudson Deputy Mayor and Trustee Len Simon. All were supportive of the governor’s efforts to incentivize housing development in their respective communities.</p><p>Croton-on-Hudson’s Simon said the village has made many advances in multifamily and affordable housing over the past several years. He noted that there are currently 101 units of housing under construction in the village with 40% of those units designated as affordable.</p><p>“We look forward to this partnership with the state,” Simon said. He added that Croton is also in partnership with the state and NYSERDA and has been designated as the number one “Clean Energy” community in the state.</p><p>Poughkeepsie Mayor Flowers said the opportunity to partner with the state on developing new housing in the city brings hope to the city that she admits is struggling. “I watch families who are literally crying because they now have to leave their homes or because there is no place for them to go that they can afford,” she said.</p><p>She noted that the City of Poughkeepsie has been expanding its housing stock and has been working with its community partners, including Habitat for Humanity, to create homeownership opportunities.&nbsp; The city is also looking to revise its zoning codes to ensure it can increase the housing available in its Main Street corridor.</p><p>The governor in her State of the State address earlier this year announced measures to help New York City address its housing shortage; a $500 million fund to unlock up to 15,000 units of housing on state-owned land; and actions to combat discrimination against low- and moderate-income New Yorkers using Section 8 housing vouchers and affordable housing providers. The Governor's Executive Budget proposal also includes measures to further enhance protections for homeowners and families against deed theft.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—At a press conference this morning here, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the City of White Plains is this year’s Downtown Revitalization Initiative Mid-Hudson Region honoree and will receive $10 million in economic development funding.</p><p>In addition, the governor reported that two Orange County communities—the villages of Highland Falls and Montgomery—$4.5 million each from the $100-million NY Forward program.</p><p>“Local communities’ downtowns are part of what makes New York State vibrant and great,” Gov. Hochul said. “These initiatives not only provide communities with the necessary funding to revitalize their downtowns, but also helps them feel seen and heard by the state. Helping uplift the areas around the Hudson River will drive tourists in and make residents excited about where they live.”</p><p>The governor during the press conference listed some of the major components of her proposed state budget, including funding for crime, infrastructure and education.</p><p>She also noted that the City of White Plains was one of 20 communities that were certified statewide earlier this week as “Pro-Housing Communities” and therefore eligible for a portion of $650 million in state discretionary funding.</p><p>The City of White Plains joins Middletown, Kingston, New Rochelle, Peekskill, Haverstraw, Ossining and Port Jervis, which were Mid-Hudson winners in the ﬁrst six rounds of the DRI.</p><p>White Plains will begin the process of developing a Strategic Investment Plan to revitalize its downtown with up to $300,000 in planning funds from the $10-million DRI grant. A Local Planning Committee made up of municipal representatives, community leaders and other stakeholders will lead the eﬀort, supported by a team of private sector experts and state planners. The Strategic Investment Plan will examine local assets and opportunities to identify economic development, transportation, housing, and community projects that align with the community's vision for downtown revitalization and that are poised for implementation. Plans for the DRI's seventh round will be complete in 2024.</p><p>Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council Co-Chairs Dr. Marsha Gordon, President &amp; CEO of The Business Council of Westchester and Dr. Kristine Young, President of SUNY Orange said, of the funding awards: “While we are already proud of everything these three winning applicants have to offer, DRI and NY Forward funding will help make White Plains, Highland Falls and Montgomery even more attractive to people who want to live, work or visit the Mid-Hudson region. By fueling game-changing plans and providing resources for these municipalities to grow, these program awards will breathe new life into these communities and foster a vibrant future for all.”</p><p>The governor noted the tremendous damage caused by rainstorms to the Village of Highland Falls in early July last year and recalled that she walked the streets of the village with local officials to survey the significant destruction caused by the flood waters. The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors applied for and received grant funding from the Realtors Relief Foundation to assist homeowners and renters in Highland Falls and other communities in the lower Hudson Valley region in the aftermath of the storm. As of December 2023, the Realtor Relief Foundation handed out $356,079 to 209 households throughout Orange, Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Rockland counties.</p><p>Under the NY Forward program, Highland Falls and Montgomery will now begin the process of developing a Strategic Investment Plan to revitalize their downtowns. A Local Planning Committee made up of municipal representatives, community leaders and other stakeholders will lead the eﬀort, supported by a team of private sector experts and state planners. The Strategic Investment Plan will examine local assets and opportunities to identify projects that align with each community's vision and that are poised for implementation. Funding will be awarded for selected projects from the Strategic Investment Plan that have the greatest potential to jumpstart revitalization and generate new opportunities for long-term growth, state officials said.</p><p>The Orange County Partnership of Goshen released a statement in regards to the New York Forward awards to Highland Falls and Montgomery.</p><p>“Since the Mid-Hudson Regional Council's inception, I've been proud to serve and play a key role in securing game-changing investments for the Hudson Valley. The Village of Highland Falls has been competing for state funding for years and is finally recognized for the good work and the good planning that they are doing. This is a wonderful victory for both the Village of Highland Falls and the Village of Montgomery. It's an honor to contribute to our region's growth and success,” said Maureen Halahan, President and CEO of the Orange County Partnership.</p><p>For Round 7 of the Downtown Revitalization Initiative, each of the state's 10 economic development regions are being awarded $10 million, to make for a total state commitment of $100 million in funding and investments to help communities boost their economies by transforming downtowns into vibrant neighborhoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—More than 85% of metro markets (189 out of 221) registered home price increases in the fourth quarter of 2023 as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped from 7.79% to 6.61%, according to the National Association of Realtors’ latest quarterly report. A total of 15% of the 221 tracked metro areas experienced double-digit price gains over the same period, up from 11% in the third quarter.</p><p>“Homeowners have benefited from housing wealth accumulation. However, many homebuyers have been shocked at high housing costs, with a typical monthly mortgage payment rising from $1,000 three years ago to more than $2,000 last year,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “This doubling in housing costs for recent home buyers is not included in the official consumer price index inflation calculations and contributes to the sense of dissatisfaction about the economy.”</p><p>Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price grew 3.5% to $391,700. In the prior quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 2.2%.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South posted the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (45%) in the fourth quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 3.2%. Prices also climbed 7.3% in the Northeast, 4.7% in the Midwest and 4.2% in the West.</p><p>“Sales were restrained due to limited inventory,” Yun said. “But increased homebuilding, along with lower mortgage rates, will not only improve housing affordability but also help bring more homes onto the market in 2024.”</p><p>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year median price increases, which can be influenced by the types of homes sold during the quarter, all recorded gains of at least 14.8%. Those include Dayton, OH (19.9%); Kingsport-Bristol-Bristol, TN-VA (19.2%); Fond du Lac, WI (18.6%); Trenton, NJ (17.3%); Salinas, CA (17.1%); Newark, NJ-PA (16.7%); Anniston-Oxford, AL (15.7%); Bloomington, IL (15.4%); Johnson City, TN (15.2%); and Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA (14.8%).</p><p>Eight of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Overall, those markets are San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($1,750,300; 11%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,299,500; 14.8%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,251,000; 4.3%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,069,400; -1.9%); Salinas, CA ($993,900; 17.1%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($931,600; 8.7%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($916,800; 7.9%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($912,100; 5.7%); Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($884,400; 6.7%); and Boulder, CO ($849,400; 11.8%).</p><p>Less than one-fifth of markets (14%; 32 of 221) experienced home price declines in the fourth quarter, down from 17% in the third quarter.</p><p>Housing affordability marginally improved in the fourth quarter on the back of declining mortgage rates. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,163, down 1.2% from the third quarter ($2,189) but up 10%—or $196 – from one year ago. Families typically spent 26.1% of their income on mortgage payments, down from 26.7% in the previous quarter but up from 24.2% one year ago.</p><p>Lack of inventory and affordability continued to impact first-time buyers during the fourth quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $332,900 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment fell slightly to $2,120, down 1.2% from the prior quarter ($2,146). However, that was an increase of $190, or 9.8%, from one year ago ($1,930). First-time buyers typically spent 39.4% of their family income on mortgage payments, down from 40.3% in the prior quarter.</p><p>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down payment mortgage in 47.1% of markets, up from 45.7% in the previous quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 2.3% of markets, down from 2.7% in the prior quarter.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Infographic---NAR-Q4-2023-Metro-Home-Prices-2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="946" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Infographic---NAR-Q4-2023-Metro-Home-Prices-2-1.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Infographic---NAR-Q4-2023-Metro-Home-Prices-2-1.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Infographic---NAR-Q4-2023-Metro-Home-Prices-2-1.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">National Association of Realtors</span></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[HGAR expects that all members act with courtesy and respect toward each other, the staff, service providers, speakers and event participants at all HGAR events and when acting as an HGAR member.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Jan. 17, 2024, at the first meeting of the 2024 HGAR Board of Directors, two new policies were put up for a vote. They both passed and were immediately made effective. The first was the <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2024/01/HGAR-Code-of-Conduct-2024.pdf" rel="noreferrer"><strong>HGAR Code of Conduct</strong></a> and the other was the <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2024/01/HGAR-Statement-of-Appropriate-Event-Conduct.pdf" rel="noreferrer"><strong>HGAR Statement of Appropriate Event Conduct</strong></a>. While the principles of these policies have been practiced for some time, the Board of Directors found it necessary to memorialize these principles and establish concrete rules relating to membership conduct. While these policies will be provided and explained to new members, it’s important for all members to know and understand what is embodied in these policies.</p><h3 id="hgar%E2%80%99s-code-of-conduct"><strong>HGAR’s Code of Conduct</strong></h3><p>HGAR is committed to providing a productive, safe and welcoming environment for everyone. In order to maintain this type of environment, HGAR expects that all members act with courtesy and respect toward each other, the staff, service providers, speakers and event participants at all HGAR events and when acting as an HGAR member. Most important, are the requirements that HGAR members will not harass or discriminate against another person based on that person’s protected class characteristic pursuant to the National Association of Realtors’ Code of Ethics and any applicable federal, state or local laws.</p><h3 id="harassment-under-the-code-of-conduct"><strong>Harassment Under the Code of Conduct</strong></h3><p>HGAR members are prohibited from harassing other HGAR members, staff, service providers, speakers, and event participants, or any other individual while the member is acting on behalf of, or as a representative of HGAR, or as a participant or attendee at any HGAR event. Harassment includes inappropriate conduct, comment, display, action, or gestures based on another person’s protected class characteristics pursuant to the National Association of Realtors’ Code of Ethics, and or any other applicable federal, state or local law. Prohibited harassment may take various forms, including, but not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, negative stereotyping or denigrating jokes or comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of abusive, foul, obscene and/or explicit language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual conduct, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, drawings, or gestures, or the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical conduct, such as unwelcome contact or touching, kissing, hugging, assault, impeding or blocking movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harassment via technology or computers to send/receive derogatory, inappropriate, messages, pictures, cartoons, jokes, or material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threats, violence, threats of violence, demands or hostile acts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sexual-harassment-under-the-code-of-conduct"><strong>Sexual Harassment Under the Code of Conduct</strong></h3><p>Sexually harassing conduct is just one form of harassment. It can be committed by a person of either the same sex or gender, or the opposite sex or gender (or any other protected category) of the person subjected to the harassment. A person may be the victim of harassment even though the offensive conduct has not been directed at the person alleging harassment, regardless of the sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation or other class status of the perpetrator. Additionally, sexually harassing conduct need not be intentional or motivated by sexual desire. The following are some examples of conduct that may constitute prohibited sexual harassment:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Unwelcome sexual flirtations, propositions, advances or other unwelcome verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unwanted physical touching or closeness, such as unwanted massages hugging, kissing, patting, pinching, or touching/pulling an individual’s clothing or hair, or any other touching that is nonconsensual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical gestures that imply a sexual act or sexual anatomy, touching oneself in a sexual nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brushing up against another person, standing too close, or lingering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using vulgar words of a sexual nature, describing body parts or sexual acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussions or inquiries about sexual fantasy, preferences, history or sex life about self or others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving personal gifts that imply an intimate relationship or otherwise lavishing someone with gifts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeated invitations and/or pressuring/coercion for dates or sexual favors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestion that an individual’s committee assignment, leadership position, job security, project assignment, or a decision affecting an individual, depends on the submission to sexual favors or relations.</p><h3 id="reporting-an-incident"><strong>Reporting an Incident</strong></h3><p>Any HGAR member who believes they have experienced or witnessed any inappropriate behavior in violation of the Code should promptly report it to HGAR’s General Counsel, or the Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, any HGAR Officer, Director, or Committee Chairperson who becomes aware of such an incident must promptly report it to HGAR. Thereafter, a private investigation will be conducted. If it is revealed that a violation of the Code has occurred, HGAR’s Executive Committee and Chief Executive Officer will determine any necessary disciplinary action against the offending party, including but not limited to, prohibition from attendance at future HGAR meetings or events, removal from a leadership or committee appointment, expulsion from membership, or any other action deemed appropriate by HGAR. Moreover, HGAR strictly prohibits all individuals from retaliating against any person who in good faith reports or participates in the investigation relating to a possible violation of the Code.</p><h3 id="hgar-statement-of-appropriate-event-conduct"><strong>HGAR Statement of Appropriate Event Conduct</strong></h3><p>In addition to the HGAR Code of Conduct, the HGAR Board of Directors also established a Statement of Appropriate Event Conduct. The “Statement” establishes that by virtue of attendance at an HGAR event, any HGAR member must, not only adhere to the HGAR Code of Conduct, but they must also abide by the statement.</p><p>In its simplest form, the statement requires that all attendees are expected to conduct themselves professionally, use good judgment, and be respectful while present at an HGAR event and HGAR will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior. This includes both actual physical and virtual attendance at an HGAR event. Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to, disruptive, harassing, or defamatory behavior, display or use of graphic images or language, destruction of property, threats, intimidation, yelling/shouting, fighting, unwanted physical contact, unwanted sexual conduct (whether physical, verbal, or non-verbal), and any conduct, statements, or images that denigrates or shows hostility toward an individual or group based on a protected class characteristic.</p><h3 id="reporting-an-incident-1"><strong>Reporting an Incident</strong></h3><p>Similar to the Code, any attendee should report any behavior they believe violates the Statement to HGAR’s General Counsel or CEO. Further, if the attendee believes they are in immediate danger, they should report the incident directly to the police via 911.</p><p>Pursuant to the statement, once made aware, HGAR has the right to take immediate action against an infringing attendee, including but not limited to, their immediate removal from the event, their prohibition from attendance at future HGAR events, and even their removal from a committee appointment.</p><h3 id="weapons-and-concealed-carry-policy"><strong>Weapons and Concealed Carry Policy</strong></h3><p>Part of the statement includes a new HGAR no weapons policy. In short, unless otherwise notified, all HGAR premises and/or HGAR events are gun-free zones and any attendee, by signing up or attending an event, expressly agrees to not bring any weapons onto the HGAR premises or to any HGAR event. Such weapons include, but are not limited to firearms, stun guns, tasers, nunchakus, brass knuckles, knives, explosives, or any other object that HGAR might consider dangerous. Only one carve-out has been made to this policy, that is that personal protection equipment, limited to peppery spray, high-powered lights, or loud audio devices/safety whistles are permitted, so long as they are stored out of sight, are used only in self-defense and are not used to commit acts or threats of physical violence, including intimidation, harassment and/or coercion.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>These new policies are here for the benefit of all members. HGAR seeks to provide a safe and nurturing space for all members to engage, learn, and grow. These new rules directly benefit all members in the creation of this welcoming environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Local Law 31 also includes a five-year testing requirement, meaning that all residential building owners in NYC must have all dwelling units inspected for lead paint by Aug. 9, 2025.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent New York Appellate Division decision in <em>E.S. v Windsor Owners Corp.</em> [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3UziUk8">https://bit.ly/3UziUk8</a>] focuses on issues relating to lead paint, the liability and legal obligations of owners and cooperative corporations in New York City, and the very real risks and dangers children and infants face each day. It is critical to be aware of the myriad of local, state, and federal legal requirements relating to lead paint, disclosure requirements, the risk of exposure, and the potential liability of owners, including cooperative corporations, landlords and management companies.</p><h3 id="es-v-windsor-owners-corp-the-facts"><strong><em>E.S. v Windsor Owners Corp.</em>: The Facts</strong></h3><p>In <em>Windsor Owners</em>, the plaintiff alleges that her child (18 months old) was exposed to lead paint while residing in a cooperative apartment which she was subleasing from one of the defendants, the record owner of the apartment, and alleges that the exposure resulted in lead poisoning of her child. The other defendants were the cooperative corporation, Windsor Owners Corp., and the management company, Tudor Realty Services Corp.</p><p>The court points out that the proprietary lease requires shareholders to obtain consent from Windsor for a sublease. The proprietary lease also includes an indemnification provision, which provides that shareholders hold “Windsor ‘harmless from all liability, loss, damage and expense arising from injury to person or property occasioned by the failure of the Lessee to comply with any provision’ of the lease or ‘due wholly or in part to any act, default or omission of the Lessee.’” Windsor and Tudor relied on the indemnification provision in their cross-claim against the Owner.</p><p>The sublease between the Plaintiff and the Owner contained the standard form of lead paint disclosure [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3ODLo8A">https://bit.ly/3ODLo8A</a>] required by the EPA and the New York City lead paint notice [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3SUSqIT">https://bit.ly/3SUSqIT</a>]. The court points out that the box on the NYC notice indicating that “A child under seven [now under six] years of age resides in the unit” was checked off by the Owner and also notes that the Plaintiff did not sign the notice. The Owner did not submit the sublease to Windsor or Tudor to obtain their consent. When Windsor did learn about the “unapproved” sublease (in early May 2017) it sent a “Notice to Cure.” The Owner and Windsor eventually entered into a settlement, which required the Owner to pay a specified amount and that also allowed the Plaintiff to remain in possession of the apartment.</p><p>The court then points out that “On May 31, 2017, the infant plaintiff underwent routine blood tests that revealed he had elevated levels of lead, and he was ultimately diagnosed with lead poisoning….” The Department of Health inspected the apartment and determined that there were hazardous levels of lead present. The DOH then issued an order directing the Owner to remediate the lead paint violations immediately, which the Owner did.</p><p>The Plaintiff then commenced the lawsuit and subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability against all defendants. The Supreme Court granted the Plaintiff’s “motion for summary judgment on liability as to Windsor and the Owner, but denied the motion as to Tudor on the ground that it, as the management company, could not be held liable for the infant plaintiff's lead poisoning.” The Supreme Court also granted the Owner’s cross-motion to dismiss Windsor and Tudor's cross-claim for indemnification because under section 5-321 of the General Obligations Law they “could not be indemnified for [their] own negligence.”</p><p>Windsor also argued that since the Owner “cohabitated” with the Plaintiffs, they were relieved from liability because under Local Law 1, if an owner resides in the apartment, then the cooperative corporation would be exempt from liability. However, the Supreme Court did not find this argument persuasive.</p><h3 id="nyc-local-law-1-and-the-court%E2%80%99s-holding"><strong>NYC Local Law 1 and the Court’s Holding</strong></h3><p>New York City’s Local Law 1 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4brT8o9">https://bit.ly/4brT8o9</a>], also known as the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act (“Local Law 1”), requires landlords to take action to prevent reasonably foreseeable injury to children six years of age or younger from peeling lead paint in multiple dwelling units built before Jan. 1, 1960. It also requires landlords and owners “to expeditiously remediate such conditions and underlying defects.”</p><p>The court explained that the following must be met in order to establish a defendant’s liability: “(1) that the subject premises were built before Jan. 1, 1960; (2) that plaintiff suffered injuries from lead poisoning from ingesting lead-based paint in the premises; (3) that plaintiff was [six] years old or under when exposed to the lead-based paint; and (4) that the owner had actual or constructive notice that the plaintiff was [six] years old or younger while residing in the premises.” Windsor and Tudor argued that they did not have actual or constructive notice that a child under the applicable age limit lived in the apartment.</p><p>The Appellate Division, however, held that the Plaintiff did establish that the defendants had constructive notice that the Plaintiff’s child occupied the apartment since August 2016. The Plaintiff testified at trial that when she moved in, she “introduced herself, the infant plaintiff, and her other child to the doormen as the new tenants in the apartment; added herself as the tenant to the building communications system; regularly received packages and deliveries; scheduled repairs; and greeted the doormen with her children on a daily basis.”</p><p>The court further explained that Local Law 1 would not apply to a cooperative corporation or a condominium where an Owner occupies the apartment or unit. However, in this case, since the Owner could not establish that he in fact did “occupy” the apartment during the Plaintiff’s sublease term, the court held that the cooperative corporation defendants (Windsor and Tudor) were liable under Local Law 1.</p><h3 id="additional-important-lead-paint-regulations-in-nyc"><strong>Additional Important Lead Paint Regulations in NYC</strong></h3><p><em>NYC Local Law 31</em></p><p>Local Law 31 (which went into effect on Aug. 9, 2020) requires landlords of multiple-dwelling residential buildings built before 1960, and multiple-dwelling residential buildings built between 1960 and 1978, where an owner has actual knowledge of the presence of lead-based paint, to have X-Ray Fluorescence lead inspections conducted by inspectors who are certified by the EPA. An owner is also required to provide annual notices [<u>see </u><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/lead/lead-in-home-bro.pdf">https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/lead/lead-in-home-bro.pdf</a> ] to tenants between January 1 and January 15 each year.</p><p>Local Law 31 also includes a five-year testing requirement, meaning that all residential building owners in NYC must have <u>all</u> dwelling units inspected for lead paint by Aug. 9, 2025.</p><p>However, apartments with children under the age of six (6) must be inspected within one year of the date the child moved into the apartment irrespective of the Aug. 9, 2025 date. Under Local Law 31 a child is deemed to “reside” in the apartment if the child spends at least 10 hours per week there.</p><p><em>NYC Local Laws 111, 122 and 123</em></p><p>Local Law 111 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/49gJt2k">https://bit.ly/49gJt2k</a>], which goes into effect on June 8, 2024, clarifies that property owners who are subject to Local Law 31 must ensure that the independent, EPA-certified inspector tests for lead-based paint in common areas, as well as individual apartment units.</p><p>Commencing on Sept. 1, 2024, Local Law 122 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/48dj9ol">https://bit.ly/48dj9ol</a>] requires an owner, upon issuance of a violation, to provide the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development with records of the annual notices provided by the owner to tenants, and records of investigations conducted by the owner, as may apply, for the preceding year. If an owner fails to provide the requested records this will be deemed a violation and additional fines will be imposed. The penalties for non-compliance under all of the NYC lead paint laws are significant. [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3HT6Rqe">https://bit.ly/3HT6Rqe</a>]. There is also exposure to personal injury claims and significant monetary damages.</p><p>Local Law 123 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/42zYWaV">https://bit.ly/42zYWaV</a>], which also goes into effect on Sept. 1, 2024, further amends the lead-based paint remediation requirements that apply on the turnover of a unit or apartment.</p><h3 id="additional-federal-state-and-local-lead-paint-rules-and-initiatives"><strong>Additional Federal, State and Local Lead Paint Rules and Initiatives</strong></h3><p>The EPA has implemented the Renovation, Repair or Painting Program and accompanying rule [<u>see</u> <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/lead-renovation-repair-and-painting-program">https://www.epa.gov/lead/lead-renovation-repair-and-painting-program</a>] which requires that any “RRP projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, childcare facilities and preschools built before 1978 be performed by lead-safe certified contractors.” The EPA’s RRP rule does not apply to homeowners undertaking their own home improvement projects, but does require an owner to use a lead-safe certified contractor if the owner rents all or part of the home, operates a childcare center in the home or is a “house flipper” for profit.</p><p>In New York State, various bills have also been introduced relating to lead paint. Senate Bill 2947 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2947">https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2947</a>] would require property owners to conduct lead paint tests and provide the reports of such test before selling or leasing the property. Senate Bill 2353 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2353">https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2353</a>] would create “a comprehensive framework for primary prevention of lead poisoning” for the first time ever in New York.</p><p>Locally, Westchester County has received a $4.1-million grant from HUD to reduce lead-based paint, dust and other safety hazards. It is noted that “in Westchester County, more than 85% of the housing stock was built before 1978; as a result, many children are potentially at risk for lead-related, lifelong learning disabilities, behavioral problems and other serious health issues.” [<u>See</u> <a href="https://homes.westchestergov.com/lead-paint">https://homes.westchestergov.com/lead-paint</a>]. The Westchester County Department of Planning will administer the grant program through the Lead Safe Westchester Program and owners of single-family or multi-family dwellings are encouraged to apply for assistance.</p><h3 id="awareness-of-lead-paint-issues-is-critical"><strong>Awareness of Lead Paint Issues Is Critical</strong></h3><p>It is critical for owners, real estate licensees, attorneys, management companies, and tenants alike to be aware of the risks, rights, duties, and legal obligations that exist with regard to lead paint issues. Children can suffer irreparable harm due to exposure to lead paint. It is important for all parties to be knowledgeable about one’s legal rights, available grants, such as the LSW Program, and other assistance available to remediate and reduce the risks of exposure of our most precious assets, our children, to lead paint.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[While 62% of the National Association of Realtors is comprised of women, a little less than 20% are Broker/Owners. “We have advanced as women in leadership, but we’re still not there in terms of being equal to our male counterparts,”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="a-firm-believer-in-women%E2%80%99s-empowerment"><strong>A Firm Believer in Women’s Empowerment</strong></h3><p>Even as a teenager, Ruth Lara Deane knew that her career would be centered around real estate. The 2024 President of the Women’s Council of Realtors, Westchester and Broker/Owner of Seer Realty, LLC in Yonkers actually began her career as a high school senior. She managed to land a job as a receptionist for a property management firm and began learning everything from the ground up.</p><p>“At that time, though, I wondered why anyone would hire a property manager when they could just do everything themselves,” she laughed. “But I quickly discovered all of the work involved and then I understood!”</p><p>Within just a year, she was handling their accounts payable and a few years later, she decided to get her real estate license. She and her husband also made their first home purchase in 2018—a two-family property in New Rochelle. “We were paying a lot of rent in Yonkers, and I thought—what are we doing—this just doesn’t make any sense to me,” Deane recalled. Soon, their home became an income-producing property from the monthly rental.</p><p>In 2020, Deane embarked on what she calls “a leap of faith” by opening her own property management firm, Stonebridge Realty Management. One year later, she earned her broker’s license and took on her first sales transaction. “It’s so rewarding helping buyers through what probably is the biggest expense of their life, and I love being part of that process,” she said. “Giving the buyers the key at the end and seeing their faces is an awesome feeling!”</p><p>In 2021, Seer Realty was born, and Deane made the decision to expand her horizons by getting involved with the Women’s Council of Realtors (WCR). “It was a natural choice for me,” she recalled. “I’m a firm believer in women’s empowerment and the commitment to growth and success.”</p><p>With her first event, she knew she had made the right choice. “I was new there and I remember meeting Barbara Peterson. She welcomed me and talked to me like she had known me for years,” Deane remembered. “That made me feel so welcome, so it was a no-brainer when it came time to join.”</p><p>Using her bookkeeping and property management skills, Deane soon made her way to Treasurer of WCR and this year, she snagged the top spot. It’s also a special year for Deane, as the local Westchester group is celebrating its 50th anniversary. “We have so many exciting plans for this year, including more educational events and a newsletter to keep people informed,” she said.</p><p>Deane explained that the national WCR was established in 1938 at a time when women were actually barred from joining many local Realtor associations. The original WCR had just 37 women from nine states. “This was a very important time in history for women,” added Deane, “but there is still work to be done.”</p><p>While 62% of the National Association of Realtors is comprised of women, a little less than 20% are Broker/Owners. “We have advanced as women in leadership, but we’re still not there in terms of being equal to our male counterparts,” said Deane. “In the commercial real estate industry as well, the majority are still men.”</p><p>Deane admits that women often struggle with balancing their time between work and their families. “We sometimes feel guilty about spending less time with our kids and we limit ourselves,” she noted. “We have to adopt the mindset that trying to do something good for ourselves does not mean we’re lacking in our role as mothers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Deane and her husband have two boys, ages 4 and 9 and the family recently purchased a single-family home in Mahopac. However, her roots remain in Yonkers and Deane still finds time to volunteer and donate school supplies and toys to the Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church in Yonkers.</p><p>She has also taught financial literacy classes to Yonkers High School students. “I think it’s important to teach kids at a young age about financial freedom,” she said. “Growing up, my father owned property and now I take my 9-year-old with me when I look at properties that we’re considering buying to renovate and flip. We have to educate the community about the whole home buying process and let them know how owning real estate will help them.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Black (26%) and Hispanic (22%) applicants experience higher denial rates for mortgage applications compared to their White (16%) and Asian (15%) counterparts,]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Homeownership rates for racial minorities increased in 2022, with Asian and Hispanic Americans achieving historic peaks. Despite these advancements, disparities persist among racial and ethnic groups, notably with Black homeownership lagging. People of color continue to endure significant buying challenges throughout and after their home purchases, according to a report released on Feb. 20 by the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>The “2024 Snapshot of Race and Home Buying in America” delves into homeownership trends within each racial group and explores obstacles encountered in the pursuit of homeownership. Leveraging NAR’s 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers data, the report also explores the demographics of home buyers, motivations for purchasing, types of properties acquired and financial profiles—specifically focusing on racial distinctions.</p><p>Compared to a decade ago (63.9% in 2012), U.S. homeownership significantly increased (65.2% in 2022), with approximately 10.5 million more homeowners. However, the homeownership rate declined from 2021 (65.4%), influenced mostly by challenging housing affordability and inventory conditions.</p><p>Despite fast-rising mortgage rates, minority groups saw increased homeownership rates in 2022. Asian (63.3%) and Hispanic (51.1%) homeownership rates registered all-time highs. The Black homeownership rate experienced a modest uptick to 44.1%, but remains substantially lower than Asian, Hispanic and White (72.3%) Americans. Since 2012, the homeownership gap between Black and White Americans has widened from 27% to 28%.</p><p>“Minority homeownership gained ground this year, with Asian and Hispanic homeownership hitting record highs,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “While the gains should be celebrated, the pathway into homeownership remains arduous for minority buyers.”</p><p>Asian Americans (6.1 percentage points or 1.5 million households) and Hispanic Americans (5.4 percentage points or 3.2 million households) experienced the largest homeownership rate gains over the last decade. White American homeownership grew by 3.1 percentage points (65,000 households), maintaining around 70% since 2017.</p><p>The data reveal significant disparities in housing affordability for existing homeowners across racial and ethnic groups. In Colorado, 41% of Black homeowners spend more than 30% of their income on housing, compared to 24% of White homeowners. In Hawaii and Iowa, the gap between the share of cost-burdened White and Black homeowners is more than 30 percentage points. In New York State, nearly 39% of Black homeowners and 37% of Hispanic and Asian homeowners spend more than 30% of their income on housing, indicating a considerable affordability challenge, while 25% of White homeowners are similarly cost-burdened.</p><p>“The impacts of housing affordability and limited inventory are more extreme for minority buyers, because more than half are first-time buyers who must rely on down payment sources beyond gained housing equity,” explained Lautz.</p><p>As rental costs escalate, they compress renters’ disposable incomes and directly impact the capacity to accumulate savings for a home down payment. This challenge is acutely amplified among minority groups, which often face additional systemic barriers and disparities in income and wealth, further exacerbating their struggle toward achieving homeownership.</p><p>&nbsp;“Potential buyers of color have a harder time saving for a down payment on a home, because they are paying more of their monthly income toward rent,” explained Lautz. “Even among successful home buyers, minorities have a higher amount of student debt—the biggest expense that holds back saving, along with rent. Once they are ready to buy, Hispanic and Black Americans have a higher rate of loan denials in the mortgage market.”</p><p>Black home buyers reported the highest share of student loan debt at 41%, with a median amount of $46,000—a record high. Twenty-nine percent of Hispanic home buyers reported having student loan debt, with a median amount of $33,300.</p><p>Black and Hispanic home buyers also encounter additional hurdles in securing mortgages. Black (26%) and Hispanic (22%) applicants experience higher denial rates for mortgage applications compared to their White (16%) and Asian (15%) counterparts, according to data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.</p><p>While Black and Hispanic applicants face greater challenges in obtaining a loan, those who manage to secure one often encounter less favorable terms with higher mortgage rates than White and Asian borrowers. Among loans originated in 2022, 20% of mortgages for Black and 21% for Hispanic borrowers came with mortgage rates exceeding 6%. This contrasts with White (18%) and Asian (15%) borrowers’ mortgages having rates above this threshold. The average mortgage rates for Black and Hispanic borrowers stood at approximately 4.9%, compared to 4.8% for White and 4.6% for Asian borrowers.</p><p>Among all home buyers, White Americans made up the largest share (81%), followed by Hispanic Americans (7%), Black Americans (7%), Asian Americans (6%) and other (6%). Fifty-five percent of Asian and 51% of Black and Hispanic buyers were first-time home buyers.</p><p>Twenty-four percent of Black, 23% of Asian and 22% of Hispanic buyers purchased multigenerational homes, compared to only 12% among White buyers. Twenty-six percent of Asian and 14% of Hispanic buyers used a gift from a relative or friend toward their down payment for their home. Eighteen percent of Hispanic, 17% of Asian and 16% of Black buyers lived with parents, relatives or friends prior to purchasing their home, compared to only 10% of White buyers.</p><h3 id="focus-on-new-york-state-data"><strong>Focus on New York State Data</strong></h3><p>The homeownership rate for White Americans in New York State in 2022 was 65%; for Black Americans it was 33%; Asian Americans it was 53% and for Hispanic Americans, 28%, which was the lowest homeownership Hispanic Americans, along with New York Massachusetts (33%) and Rhod Island (36%).</p><p>The share of homeowners who spend more than 30% of their income on housing were: White (25%); Black (38.9%); Asian (37.2%) and Hispanic (36.5%).</p><p>The share of renters in New York State that can afford to buy the typical home: White (24%), Black (11%); Asian (27%) and Hispanic (15%).</p><p>The credit denial rates in New York State in 2022 were for: White (16%); Black (27%); Asian (16%) and Hispanic (24%) applicants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Studies have shown that the construction of 100 units of multifamily housing generates an average of 161 jobs and $11.7 million into the local economy in the first year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The housing crisis and the lack of inventory continue to be an issue. Both local and state governments seem unable to handle this issue as there has been a high level of indecision and stagnation in our community growth. This is bad on a few levels. This is bad for our bottom lines as there is a limitation on housing inventory. This is bad for our communities as there is a limit to having citizen age in place and welcoming new individuals and families. There are also massive economic and ethical issues that the housing crisis causes. Really, the only good news is that our needs as an industry are linked with the needs of the community on those ethical and economic levels. So, what do we do?</p><p>First off, we cannot wait for the government or NAR to solve this issue—we need to focus our efforts on where the issue is. All housing is local, and as local housing experts, it will come down to a new level of activism from all of us. I say activism, but what I really mean is networking. Networking with our elected officials like our state representatives, our area mayors and our zoning boards.</p><p>Zoning and Planning boards are volunteer committees that every municipality has. Zoning and planning board meetings are where most new developments and multi-family housing go to die. These land use board meetings are namely attended by “concerned neighbors” of almost any new development called NIMBYs. This small but vocal group delays new housing projects until sometimes the developer walks away. As Realtors, housing professionals and members of the community, it is our responsibility, and ultimately a good use of our time, to combat this narrative that new housing is bad.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that new housing is a net gain for communities as a whole, their local downtowns and their school districts. Studies have shown that the construction of 100 units of multifamily housing generates an average of 161 jobs and $11.7 million into the local economy in the first year. On average, these 100 units also support 44 new jobs and generate $2.6 million each year once the project is complete.</p><p>Additionally, new housing, particularly multifamily housing, is good for local school districts. This common nomenclature from the NIMBY contingent is false. A recent study in Westchester County found that recent housing development did not have a major impact on school enrollment. In fact, the projects generated a net-positive financial benefit in the form of school taxes, even after taking into account the cost of educating the enrolled school children living in those new units.</p><p>This data is shocking to some people, especially since the school enrollment data is a favorite talking point against new housing developments. Land use boards and the mayors of our local towns do not have this knowledge. It is one thing for me to promote this information, as I will always be seen as a housing advocate connected with a pro-housing organization, but it is another thing entirely and would be much more effective if it came from a member of the community. A YIMBY vs a NIMBY.</p><p>When there is a public discussion around housing, whether it’s at a zoning board hearing or a local politician’s fundraiser, we need Realtors to speak in favor of these projects. Realtors are natural networkers and salespeople. We need to tap into these skills for civic use. I hope this does not come off as too glib, but in the same way, as we talk about granite countertops and natural lighting, we need to talk about pro-housing data and zoning reform.</p><p>Many resources can help facilitate this networking. Organizations like Welcome Home Westchester and local papers like <em>The Examiner</em>, often report on new developments that are being discussed on a local level. As your Government Affairs Director, I can make introductions to your local officials and let you know when political fundraisers take place as well as provide the talking points for the studies I previously referenced. Our communities and livelihoods require our members to advocate and network for a more equitable community that builds more housing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales grew by more than 3% in January, according to the National Association of Realtors. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales accelerated in the Midwest, South and West, and remained steady in the Northeast. Year-over-year, sales improved in the West, and decreased in the Northeast, Midwest and South.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—rose 3.1% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.00 million in January. Year-over-year, sales slipped 1.7% (down from 4.07 million in January 2023).</p><p>U.S. home sales fell 1% in December, but rose slightly in November (0.8%), which ended a five-month slide in home sales.</p><p>“While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January's monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Listings were modestly higher, and home buyers are taking advantage of lower mortgage rates compared to late last year.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of January was 1.01 million units, up 2.0% from December and 3.1% from one year ago (980,000). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.0-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 3.1 months in December but up from 2.9 months in January 2023.</p><p>“More listings will help Americans move,” said NAR President Kevin Sears, broker-partner of Sears Real Estate in Springfield, MA. “That's why NAR has pushed for the passage of H.R. 1321—The More Homes on the Market Act—which would lower the tax hit on home sales and bring additional inventory to the market.”</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, an increase of 5.1% from one year ago ($360,800). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><p>“The median home price reached an all-time high for the month of January,” Yun added. “Multiple offers are common on mid-priced homes, and many homes were still sold within a month. The elevated share of cash deals—32%—indicated a market full of multiple offers and propelled by record-high housing wealth."</p><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 36 days in January, up from 29 days in December and 33 days in January 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 28% of sales in January, down from 29% in December and 31% in January 2023. NAR's 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 32% of transactions in January, up from 29% in both December and one year ago.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 17% of homes in January, up from 16% in December and January 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales— foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in January, virtually unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates"><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.77% as of Feb. 15. That's up from 6.64% the previous week and 6.32% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales"><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-Op Sales</strong></h3><p>Single-family home sales moved higher to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 million in January, up 3.4% from 3.48 million in December, but down 1.4% from the prior year. The median existing single-family home price was $383,500 in January, up 5.0% from January 2023.</p><p>At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 400,000 units in January, existing condominium and co-op sales were unchanged from last month and down 4.8% from one year ago (420,000 units). The median existing condo price was $339,400 in January, up 5.7% from the previous year ($321,100).</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown"><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>At 480,000 units, existing-home sales in the Northeast were unchanged from December but down 5.9% from January 2023. The median price in the Northeast was $434,300, up 10.1% from the prior year.</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales increased 2.2% from one month ago to an annual rate of 950,000 in January, down 3.1% from last year. The median price in the Midwest was $271,700, up 7.6% from January 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South rose 4.0% from December to an annual rate of 1.84 million in January, a decline of 1.6% from the previous year. The median price in the South was $345,100, up 4.1% from one year ago.</p><p>In the West, existing-home sales elevated 4.3% from a month ago to an annual rate of 730,000 in January and grew 2.8% from one year earlier.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—The January home sales report released on Friday by OneKey MLS indicated the regional median home sale price rose sharply last month, single-family home sales were down 5% regionwide and in some good news for the markets, pending sales were up significantly in all housing sectors in the market area that includes Montauk to Manhattan, north through the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains.</p><p>OneKey MLS reported a regional, single-family, closed median sale price of $649,000 in January, an 8.2% increase over the reported January 2023 price of $600,000. For condominiums, OneKey MLS reported a closed median sale price of $529,950 in January 2024, an increase of 21.8% over $435,000 reported in the prior year. The closed median sale price of co-ops rose minimally as well, up 1.7% from $295,000 in January 2023 to $300,000 in January 2024.</p><p>A subsidiary of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the Long Island Board of Realtors, OneKey MLS is one of the nation’s leading Multiple Listing Services, serving more than 47,000 real estate professionals and 4,500 participating offices throughout Long Island, New York City, and the Hudson Valley.</p><p>For single-family homes, there were reportedly 2,591 closed sales transactions and 2,424 pending sales transactions in January, representing a 5.0% decrease in closed sales (down from 2,727) and a 9.5% increase in pending sales (up from 2,214) as compared to the prior year.</p><p>There were 466 closed sales transactions and 592 pending sales transactions reported for condos in January 2024, representing a 2.0% increase in closed sales transactions (up from 457) and a 35.8% increase in pending sales transactions (up from 436) from the prior year. 556 co-op closed sales were reported on the MLS in January 2024, down 8.6% from the 608 closed sales transactions in January 2023. Pending co-op sales increased by 32.1%, reportedly 753 in January 2024, up from 570 the prior year.</p><p>Despite decreases in closed sales activity between January 2024 and January 2023, the persistent shortage of housing supply has helped to keep home prices rising, which is reflected regionally in the reporting by OneKey MLS.</p><p>New listings year-over-year in January were down for single-family homes, condominiums and co-ops by 3.5%, 8.3% and 16.1% respectively, according to the OneKey MLS report.</p><p>For the HGAR market area, the new listings data was a mixed bag, with some housing types in select counties posting increases in new listings, while other counties continued to post listing declines. In the Bronx, single-family listings were down 38.4% year-over-year in January, while condominium listings fell 13.5% and co-ops declined 14.4%. Orange County saw a 2.3% drop in single-family listings and an 11.4% drop in condominium listings. Putnam County’s single-family listings dropped 15.9%, while condominium listings were flat as compared to January 2023’s totals.</p><p>Rockland County’s single-family listings last month were flat as compared to 12 months earlier, while condominium listings shot up 23.1% and condominium listings dropped by 20.0%. Westchester County’s single-family listings dropped slightly by 2.0% last month, while condominium listings rose 15.5%, but co-op new listings declined 18.3%.</p><p>The one true bright spot in the HGAR market area was in Sullivan County where single-family listings shot up 53.2% last month as compared to a year earlier</p><p>OneKey MLS concluded its report by noting that the increase in pending sales transactions for single-family residences, condominiums, and co-ops regionwide may indicate a potential spring thaw as buyers take advantage of stabilizing mortgage rates to achieve their homeownership goals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—January home sales continued to decline, while prices increased in most markets in the Greater New York City Metropolitan area, according to a report released today by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR), based on data supplied by OneKey MLS. A limited supply and strong demand are responsible for the current market conditions.</p><p>However, as the spring selling season approaches, the region’s home sales sector is bolstered by a noticeable increase in pending sales throughout the region, HGAR officials noted. With the prospect of lower mortgage rates as the Federal Reserve Board considers multiple rate cuts this year, home sales are expected to increase as more homes come to the market beginning in the spring and summer months.</p><p>“With mortgage interest rates moving slightly higher now, we continue to experience the trend of people taking a ‘wait and see’ approach before deciding to list their homes for sale, but would caution against trying to time the real estate market based on such marginal changes,” noted HGAR President Carmen Bauman. “Nevertheless, we do anticipate more movement during the Spring with additional inventory on the market.”</p><p>Sales of single-family homes declined in all six of HGAR’s coverage areas, while some counties experienced increases in co-op or condo sales. All six regions saw price increases in all property types.</p><p>“While it will take some time to have the HGAR home sales market fully reset from the impacts of high inflation and mortgage interest rates, home sales are projected to rise significantly in each of the next two years as the market steadily returns to normal sales activity,’” said HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez.</p><h3 id="bronx-county"><a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2024/02/0124-BronxCounty.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Bronx County</a></h3><p>In the Bronx, January sales of condos plummeted by almost 46%, while co-op sales dropped 12.6%, followed by single-family homes, with a decrease of 11.6 % as compared to last January. Co-ops experienced the highest median sales price gain to $247,500 – a 38.3% increase from last January. For single-family homes, the median sales price increased 11.3% to $640,000 and 10.7% to $300,000 for condos.</p><p>New listings declined for single-family homes, condos, and co-ops at 11.6%, 13.5% and 14.4% respectively. The decline of overall inventory for condos was the highest at 42.2%, followed by single-family homes at almost 32%. Co-op overall inventory dropped by 19.5%. Pending home sales transactions were 10.5% higher in the Bronx in January as compared to January 2023.</p><h3 id="westchester-county"><a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2024/02/0124-WestchesterCounty.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Westchester County</a></h3><p>In Westchester County, January sales of single-family homes and co-ops decreased 12.7% and 19.2% respectively, while condo sales increased 1.4% compared to January of 2023. The median sales price increased 5.4% to $858,250 for single-family homes and 31.5% to $562,000 for condos. The median sales price for co-ops decreased 1.6% to $182,000.</p><p>New condo listings increased 15.5% while new co-op listings declined 18.3%. New listings for single-family homes decreased by just 2.2%. Overall inventory of single-family homes for sale declined by almost 30%, while co-op inventory was down by 37% and condos, 16.3%. Pending home sales rose 6.9% in Westchester as compared to a year earlier.</p><h3 id="putnam-county"><a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2024/02/0124-PutnamCounty.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Putnam County</a></h3><p>In Putnam County, January sales of condos dropped by more than 33.3%, while single-family home sales decreased by 16.3%. There were no co-op sales reported.

    <description><![CDATA[According to the Centers for Disease Control, every year more than 805,000 people in the U.S. suffer a heart attack, and in 2021 alone, some 695,000 died from heart attacks.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you work in the real estate industry, chances are you’re constantly on the go—running from meeting to meeting, checking in on your listings, reviewing inspections, attending closings, and spending countless hours on the phone—all while trying to juggle your personal life. Chances are also that you may not be making the healthiest food choices or spending enough time on physical fitness.</p><p>Dina Katz, MD, FACC, senior attending cardiologist at Phelps Hospital in Tarrytown, has heard the same story all too many times, and unfortunately, these bad habits can often lead to heart disease. “While men in the U.S. continue to lead the pack in heart disease, it’s now also the leading cause of death in females,” she said. “In fact, one in every five women in this country die each year from heart disease.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Dr.-Dina-Katz-1.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Dr.-Dina-Katz-1.JPG 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Dr.-Dina-Katz-1.JPG 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Dr.-Dina-Katz-1.JPG 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dr. Dina Katz, attending cardiologist, Phelps Hospital, Tarrytown</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, every year more than 805,000 people in the U.S. suffer a heart attack, and in 2021 alone, some 695,000 died from heart attacks. “But the good news is that more than 80% &nbsp;of heart disease is preventable—just by making some simple changes in diet, lifestyle and medications,” Dr. Katz added.</p><p>The first thing Dr. Katz recommends is making and keeping your doctors’ appointments. “We understand that people are busy with their jobs and their families, but maintaining good health should always be a priority,” she noted.</p><p>In addition to regular blood pressure monitoring, her recommendations include blood tests for cholesterol and A1C (sugar level) screenings, and a calcium score test to determine the amount of calcification in arteries. “This is a phenomenal test that fuels prevention because once patients have the knowledge about what’s happening inside their bodies, they can begin prevention methods such as medication to control cholesterol,” she explained.</p><p>Because many heart conditions can be heredity, Dr. Katz advocates for screenings at an early age. “It’s also important that even children learn about healthy food options and exercise so they can begin living a healthy lifestyle and not have to play ‘catch up’ when they’re older,” she acknowledged. “Kids also model themselves after their parents, so if they see a parent exercising every day and making healthy food choices, they’re more likely to do the same.”</p><p>The most popular excuse she hears for not exercising is “not enough time.” “I get it,” she admitted. “Who wants to wake up at 5:30 a.m. and get on a treadmill or spend an hour at the gym after a long day at work? But you can break it up into segments and take 10-minute walks during your coffee break or lunch hour,” she said.</p><p>The American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week—which is about 30 minutes, five days a week. “I keep a pair of sneakers and sweatpants in my car at all times, so I can take short walks between appointments,” Dr. Katz noted. “If you take 10 minutes to look at social media or talk on the phone, you can certainly work in 10 minutes here and there for physical activity.”</p><p>Jenna Koroly, MS, RD, CSOWM, CDN, senior registered dietitian with Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, shared her secrets for maintaining healthy eating habits. “Planning is the key,” she revealed. “If you don’t plan ahead, you’re likely to make unhealthy choices when you’re hungry.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Jenna-Koroly-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Jenna-Koroly-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Jenna-Koroly-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/Jenna-Koroly-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Jenna Koroly, senior registered dietitian, Lenox Hill Hospital, Manhattan</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Processed foods like cookies, crackers, chips, candy and fast food are often easier options, but can wreak havoc on your diet. She recommends stocking your refrigerator or cooler with fruits, raw vegetables, hummus, plain Greek yogurt, nuts or protein bars with low sugars. “Whole, unprocessed foods are the best choice and foods like chickpeas, black beans and edamame are also great protein sources that can keep you full longer,” Koroly added.</p><p>When grocery shopping, she recommends shopping the perimeter of the store. “That’s where most of the non-processed foods are found—fruits, vegetables, yogurt, fish, lean meats, nuts and whole grains,” she said. “Once you start training your body and your brain to eat these foods, you’ll start to crave them instead of the sweets and fats.”</p><p>Free apps like “My Fitness Pal” track food’s calories, salt, sugar and vitamin content. “You can also plan what you’ll eat for the following day so that will take the pressure off and the challenges away,” she said. Finally, choosing a vegetarian or vegan diet is not always necessary for maintaining good health. “It all depends on the individual person and what he or she feels like they can do over the long term,” she said.</p><p>The last part of the healthy living puzzle is often overlooked. Cheryl Smith Alvarez, Director of Westchester Transcendental Meditation Center in Katonah and TM instructor, believes mindfulness and meditation are just as important as exercising and eating healthy. “TM has been proven to lower blood pressure, reduce stress and anxiety and promote clarity and creativity,” she explained. “And research has indicated that stress is the root cause of about 80% of doctor’s visits.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/People-Meditating.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/People-Meditating.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/People-Meditating.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/People-Meditating.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/02/People-Meditating.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A steady TM practice will decrease stress to help navigate the ups and downs of everyday business.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>TM, a silent meditation, was developed by Maharishi Mahesh in India in the mid-1950s. Today, more than six million people worldwide have learned the technique.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;American Heart Association, TM is the only meditation practice that has been shown to lower blood pressure. The AHA also reported that lower blood pressure through a TM practice is associated with substantially reduced rates of death, heart attack and stroke.</p><p>Alvarez has even taught the nearly 70-year-old practice to doctors, nurses, and frontline workers throughout Westchester and New York City through the TM Center’s “Heal the Healers Now” program. “People in these positions can often become overwhelmed and suffer burnout, but a steady TM practice will decrease that stress to help them better navigate the ups and downs they face every day.”</p><p>Those in the real estate industry are no exception, where stress can be part of every deal. “Regular TM practice will help you to become less reactive and calmer in stressful situations,” added Alvarez.</p><p>TM can also help ensure a better night’s sleep and provide motivation and energy. “It’s not just a temporary ‘time out.’ Adding this to your daily routine—just 20 minutes in the morning and early evening—not only strengthens your nervous system but adds balance to your life,” she said. “It’s the ultimate self-care that results in inner peace.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in January dropped 4.9%, the National Association of Realtors reported on Feb. 29. The Northeast and West posted monthly gains in transactions while the Midwest and South recorded losses. All four U.S. regions registered year-over-year decreases.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—decreased to 74.3 in January. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 8.8%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“The job market is solid, and the country's total wealth reached a record high due to stock market and home price gains,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “This combination of economic conditions is favorable for home buying. However, consumers are showing extra sensitivity to changes in mortgage rates in the current cycle, and that's impacting home sales.”</p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown"><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The Northeast PHSI increased 0.8% from last month to 63.6, a decline of 5.5% from January 2023. The Midwest index decreased 7.6% to 73.7 in January, down 11.6% from one year ago.</p><p>The South PHSI declined 7.3% to 88.5 in January, falling 9.0% from the prior year. The West index rose 0.5% in January to 61.1, down 7.0% from January 2023.</p><p>“Southern states and those in the Rocky Mountain time zone experienced faster job growth compared to the rest of the country,” added Yun. “As a result, long-term housing demand is increasing more significantly in these regions. However, the timing and number of purchases will largely depend on the prevailing mortgage rates and inventory availability.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/NAR-January-2024_PHS-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/NAR-January-2024_PHS-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/02/NAR-January-2024_PHS-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">SOURCE: NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS</em></i></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA, CA– According to Realtor.com’s February housing report released today (March 5), the spring housing market is shaping up to be an active one for prospective homebuyers. In fact, there were 14.8% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in February compared to the same time in 2023, which marks the fourth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.</p><p>“The first couple of months of 2024 have proven to be positive for inventory levels, as the number of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist of Realtor.com. “While the country is still well below pre-pandemic levels, the South is leading the charge, moving faster than other parts of the country, largely driving the increase in availability of homes priced between $200,000 and $350,000, a price category that saw the most year-over-year growth nationally.”</p><p>The national median listing price in February was up 0.3% to $415,500, while acting listings were 14.8% higher than a year ago and new listings rose 11.3% as compared to February 2023.</p><p>The New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY, NJ-PA market posted a median listing price in February of $750,000 up 10.2% year-over-year. The market’s active listing count was down 9.9% and its new listings were 3.1% lower in February as compared to 12 months earlier.</p><h3 id="affordable-home-inventory-grows"><strong>Affordable Home Inventory Grows</strong></h3><p>Homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range nationwide grew by 20.6% compared to last year, outpacing all other price categories. For home shoppers looking for affordable options, this may lead to particularly favorable home buying conditions. And, though the market is still a ways away from pre-pandemic levels, homebuyers may anticipate more options to choose from, compared to recent years, heading into the hot spring homebuying season especially in this category, the report stated.</p><h3 id="southern-metros-see-the-most-inventory-growth"><strong>Southern Metros See the Most Inventory Growth</strong></h3><p>The inventory of homes actively for sale increased in 29 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year. Orlando (+38.5%), Miami (37.4%) and Tampa (36.3%) experienced the most inventory growth. While most metros are still seeing lower inventory levels when compared to pre-pandemic years, three metros actually saw higher levels of inventory in February compared to typical 2017 to 2019 levels. The top three were in the South, particularly in Texas: San Antonio (+26.6%), Austin (+10.8%), and Dallas (+2.2%).</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates-remain-in-flux-but-sellers-are-ready-to-move"><strong>Mortgage Rates Remain in Flux, but Sellers are Ready to Move</strong></h3><p>As mortgage rates continue to shift, home sales have been sensitive to the fluctuations. While rates declined abruptly in November and December they steadied around 6.6% in January and early February, before climbing higher following a hot inflation report, most recently hitting 6.94%.</p><p>Additionally, the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 13.2% in February of last year to 14.6% this year, marking the first time the share of price reductions had increased over the previous year since May of 2023. In fact, newly listed homes were 11.3% above last year's levels for the fourth month of increasing-listing activity after a 17-month streak of decline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[A key data point will be the CPI reaching its 2% target. The latest CPI number for February was 3.1%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—While the Federal Reserve Board is not expected to lower mortgage lending rates later this month, National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun believes that once inflation hits the Fed’s target of 2% it will then seriously consider instituting multiple cuts this year and next.</p><p>In fact, during NAR’s virtual “Real Estate Forecast Summit: Commercial Update” held on March 7, Yun predicted that the Federal Reserve will cut rates maybe four to six times in the next two years. Yun and Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List, offered 2023 data on the commercial markets, including the multifamily sector, and their views on how they will perform in 2024.</p><p>He said that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has stated that the Fed could cut rates three times in 2024, but its decision will be based on data. A key data point will be the CPI reaching its 2% target. The latest CPI number for February was 3.1%.</p><p>One contributor to the high CPI has been apartment rent growth. Yun believes that rents are now moderating and will continue to do so, which will help the CPI eventually get to the Fed’s 2% target rate.</p><p>Among some of his other prognostications include that the 10-year Treasury yield settling down at 3.5%; commercial property prices will stabilize, with the exception of office buildings; the U.S. will register moderate GDP growth in 2024 which will bolster net leasing and investment sales and both the land and single-family development sectors will perform well.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/03/page-12-copy.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/page-12-copy.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/page-12-copy.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/page-12-copy.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/03/page-12-copy.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yun noted that overall commercial real estate transactions fell 60% in 2023 as compared to 2021 due to high-interest rates. He said that early indications for this year indicate that retail and warehouse leasing activity will be slightly lower than last year.</p><p>In terms of the troubled office market, Yun said, despite the continued strong job creation, “People are saying, ‘We don’t need offices.’” He said that while some estimate the overall national office vacancy rate is about 15%, the non-utilization rate may be between 60% to 70%. Yun said that many companies will likely renew their leases, but cut back the size of their leased space. Therefore, he expects negative office space absorption over the next few years and the national office vacancy rate to rise above 20% this year.</p><p>Yun added that the delinquency rate on office properties has been rising and will continue to trend higher in 2024.</p><p>On a positive note, he reported that hotel occupancy rates are back to pre-Covid levels at more than 60% and he predicts the rate will rise above 65% by the end of 2024.</p><p>Both Yun and Popov believe that there is a lag between actual apartment rent prices and that the CPI’s apartment rent figures are not up to date. “We know that market rent growth peaked almost six quarters ago. It takes time—we now estimate it takes about six quarters—for most of the rent deceleration growth to actually factor into the CPI,” Popov said.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/03/page-18-copy.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/page-18-copy.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/page-18-copy.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/page-18-copy.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/03/page-18-copy.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>He said this is good news for inflation and the prospect of future rate cuts because the Fed knows that private indices have reported the rapid deceleration of rent growth or “the evaporation of rent growth entirely.”</p><p>Popov said that the Sunbelt metro areas are reporting the slowest rate of rent growth due to the significant supply coming onto the market, while metro areas in the Midwest are showing the fastest rent growth.</p><p>He predicted that due to the large supply of new apartment product expected to hit the market in 2024, “We are going to see a real dearth of new apartments coming online towards the end of 2025 and in 2026 because that will be the lag effect of the current high-interest rate environment.”</p><p>Popov said that in much smaller numbers than the new apartment market, the build-to-rent single-family development market is surging at the moment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While many real estate professionals are familiar with the concept of adverse possession, few consider the issues relating to adverse possession when selling and purchasing real property. Adverse possession allows a person who takes possession of real property, makes improvements to it, possesses it in a public manner, and continuously does so for an extended period of time (i.e., 10 years), to acquire a full ownership interest in the real property.</p><h3 id="the-current-adverse-possession-law-as-modified-in-2008"><strong>The Current Adverse Possession Law as Modified in 2008</strong></h3><p>In 2008, New York State enacted critical changes to the adverse possession law under Article 5 of the Real Property Actions &amp; Proceedings Law (RPAPL) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3edAY0I">https://bit.ly/3edAY0I</a>]. Section 501 of RPAPL provides key definitions. Under Section 501(1) an “adverse possessor” is defined as a person or entity who or that “occupies real property of another person or entity with or without knowledge of the other's superior ownership rights, in a manner that would give the owner a cause of action for ejectment.” This means that an adverse possessor is an individual or entity against whom or which an owner could bring an action to evict. If an owner brings an action within the 10-year period from the point at which the adverse possession commenced, then an owner would be able to evict and remove the adverse possessor (or in the case above, a squatter) from the property.</p><h3 id="a-review-of-the-basic-elements-of-adverse-possession"><strong>A Review of the Basic Elements of Adverse Possession</strong></h3><p>For an individual to claim title to the property, the adverse possessor must establish the following elements: (1) claim of right, (2) possession must be open and notorious, (3) exclusive, (4) continuous, (5) actual, and (6) hostile.</p><p><em>Claim of Right</em></p><p>Under Section 501(3), which was a change and element introduced in 2008, a “claim of right” is defined as “a reasonable basis for the belief that the property belongs to the adverse possessor or property owner, as the case may be.” An adverse possessor must actually believe or be convinced that the adverse possessor has a legal right to the land being occupied.</p><p><em>Open and Notorious</em></p><p>An adverse possessor’s possession of the real property must be “open and notorious.” This basically means that possession must be obvious and noticeable. It cannot be of a hidden or unknown nature. For example, if a squatter occupies the premises in secrecy and without the owner’s knowledge it would not satisfy this element of adverse possession.</p><p><em>Exclusive Use</em></p><p>The adverse possessor must have exclusive use, control, and occupancy over the property in question. A key component of the “exclusive” element is that the adverse possessor must not acknowledge at any time during the 10-year period that the property belongs to another person, nor shall the adverse possessor allow the owner or any other person or entity to use and occupy the property. Once this occurs, the adverse possession claim will fail, however, tenancy and occupancy rights may continue to exist.</p><p><em>Hostile</em></p><p>The “hostile” element is similar to other elements and is usually found to exist if all of the other elements above exist. It basically requires that the use of the property must be without the consent or permission of the owner. If at any time during the 10-year period, permission is sought to occupy, use, or improve the property, that would immediately terminate a claim of adverse possession.</p><p><em>Continuous and Actual</em></p><p>The adverse possessor must continuously and actually occupy the property for the requisite 10-year period. The continuous element does not require that the person who initiated the adverse possession and occupancy of the property be the same person who continues the possession for the 10-year period. To clarify, “continuous” does not mean that the acts of adverse possession continue on a constant basis, but they must be repeated acts that are consistent with a claim of right and ownership.</p><h3 id="squatter%E2%80%99s-rights-in-new-york-trespasser-or-squatter"><strong>Squatter’s Rights in New York: Trespasser or Squatter</strong></h3><p>In New York, squatter’s rights arise when an individual moves into a vacant home or apartment without the consent or authorization of the owner and remains there for an extended period of time. Squatters usually target homes or apartments that have been vacant for long periods. A common occurrence is where a squatter unlawfully enters and occupies the home of an elderly individual who goes into a nursing home, or the residence of an individual who has recently passed away. Sometimes the home or apartment is left unoccupied and unattended because the homeowner does not have any family. Other times, the individual does have family, but the individual’s family members live far away and are not able to visit or attend to the individual’s home frequently, leaving the opportunity for strangers (i.e., squatters) to move in unsuspectingly.</p><p>In New York City, when an individual takes possession of and occupies an apartment or property for thirty (30) days, that individual acquires squatter’s rights and an owner or landlord would have to commence formal eviction proceedings under New York law (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3v42QN0">https://bit.ly/3v42QN0</a>] to remove the squatter. Eviction proceedings can be very expensive and time-consuming. In the event formal removal proceedings are necessary, real estate transactions will be delayed considerably and may even be terminated, and in the case of the Queens couple, these issues can present significant problems even after the closing occurs.</p><p>If on the other hand, a squatter is discovered prior to the thirty (30) day period, then that person would be considered a trespasser and would be able to be removed by the authorities. The owner must contact the police immediately. This would avoid having to file a formal eviction proceeding.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%98self-help%E2%80%99-is-prohibited"><strong>‘Self-Help’ is Prohibited</strong></h3><p>Any attempt by a homeowner or landlord to remove a “squatter” (and a tenant or holdover tenant) utilizing “self-help” would be deemed an unlawful eviction [<u>see</u> NYC Code Section 26-521 at <a href="https://bit.ly/43e6v7q">https://bit.ly/43e6v7q</a>] and the owner or landlord would be subject to criminal liability. There are also significant civil fines ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 that can be assessed against owners who engage in self-help.</p><p>Some examples of “self-help” include using physical force to personally remove a squatter or tenant, shutting off utilities (e.g., heat, water, electricity, etc.), and denying physical access to the premises by changing locks. Under no circumstances should an owner or landlord ever engage in “self-help” to remove a squatter or tenant from a property.</p><h3 id="legislative-attempts-to-change-squatter%E2%80%99s-rights-have-been-unsuccessful"><strong>Legislative Attempts to Change Squatter’s Rights Have Been Unsuccessful</strong></h3><p>Proposed legislation was introduced in 2013 and 2023 [<u>see</u> Senate Bill S5940A at <a href="https://bit.ly/3VeyzWq">https://bit.ly/3VeyzWq</a>; Senate Bill S5979 at <a href="https://bit.ly/3IvVgxN">https://bit.ly/3IvVgxN</a>] attempting to specifically exclude “squatter” from the definition of tenant under the eviction laws. The more recent bill, Senate Bill S5979, proposes that “a tenant shall not include a person who enters onto a property with the intent of squatting on the property or otherwise settles on land or occupies property without title, right, permission of the rightful owner or payment of rent.” It also proposes to make squatting a criminal offense and would be added “to the definition of criminal trespass in the third degree.” There may be some renewed interest in the proposed legislation in light of the increased prevalence of squatters occupying properties.</p><h3 id="the-importance-of-being-proactive-and-knowledgeable"><strong>The Importance of Being Proactive and Knowledgeable</strong></h3><p>It is clear from the experience of the Queens couple that it is extremely important for owners, landlords, representatives of a decedent’s estate, real estate agents and attorneys to be aware of the potential pitfalls that can arise when squatters occupy a property or apartment. It is important for these individuals to understand they can face considerable delays and expenses to remove a squatter.</p><p>Before marketing a property for sale and prior to signing any contract, owners should discuss all of these potential issues with legal counsel. If agents are aware of these issues, they should recommend their clients speak to an attorney right away so these issues can be addressed before it is too late and before any negotiations begin. For example, if a property is being marketed as vacant and free from tenancies, it is important to include provisions in the contract of sale that allow either party to cancel the contract if the occupants do not vacate or are unable to be removed prior to a closing.</p><p>It is also important for owners, landlords and estate representatives to be proactive to avoid the issues that can arise in connection with a squatter. Since squatters obtain tenant rights after thirty (30) days, it is critical for them to be vigilant in maintaining and inspecting the property on a frequent basis. If there is any evidence that any individuals have gained access to a property or an apartment, the authorities should be contacted immediately so they may be removed as trespassers. However, if there is evidence that squatters have been on the property for an extended period of time, the police may not be able to remove them. While these issues can clearly present problems, many times they can be avoided by being diligent and being aware of the pitfalls in advance.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lobby Day 2024 is right around the corner—<strong>March 27th</strong>. Although this year we are heading up to Albany earlier than last year, we have already had a strong response from HGAR members planning to attend. Whether it’s arriving the night before or taking one of our two free buses up to the State Capital, our members are ready to meet their elected officials so their voices on key issues can be heard.</p><p>&nbsp;So let us go over some of the basics of the day.</p><h3 id="legislative-agenda"><strong>Legislative Agenda</strong></h3><p>Here are the topics that on HGAR’s and NYSAR Legislative Agenda for 2024.</p><h3 id="support-local-regulated-housing-restoration-adjustment-lrhra-s63352ca06772"><strong>Support: Local Regulated Housing Restoration Adjustment (LRHRA) S63352C/A06772</strong></h3><p><em>Sponsor Sen. Leroy Comrie and Assemblyman Kenny Burgos</em></p><p>The bill provides that when a housing accommodation has been vacated after continuous tenancy or occupancy of 10 years or more prior to vacancy, and the owner has submitted documentation to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (HCR) demonstrating restoration of the unit, the new legal-regulated rent shall be the rent agreed to by the owner and first tenant after such restoration and reserved in a lease or other rental agreement; provided that such new legal-regulated rent does not exceed Voucher Payment Standards for the geographic area.</p><p>HGAR supports legislation that adds affordable rent-stabilized apartments to the rental housing stock that are safe, lead-free, energy efficient, and fully compliant with building codes. These apartments will be affordable to working families from the local communities where the apartments are located.</p><h3 id="support-section-8-insurance-discrimination"><strong>Support: Section 8 / Insurance Discrimination</strong></h3><p>There are emerging issues around Section 8 and insurance discrimination where insurers are asking if a building takes Section 8 vouchers. This is clear discrimination and HGAR stands strongly against such issues. There are also issues with insurance premiums going up by more than 40% year-over-year. HGAR is particularly concerned about this issue not getting the attention of our elected leaders.</p><h3 id="support-first-time-homebuyer-savings-account-program"><strong>Support: First-Time Homebuyer Savings Account Program</strong></h3><p><em>(S.6574-Cooney/A.6933-Ramos)</em></p><p>NYSAR/HGAR supports establishing a New York State First Home Savings Account Program, which would provide a state income tax deduction on deposits of up to $10,000 annually for joint filers and $5,000 annually for individuals when funds are used toward the purchase of a first home in New York, including townhouses, condos and co-ops.</p><h3 id="support-combat-illegal-discrimination-in-cooperative-housing"><strong>Support: Combat illegal discrimination in cooperative housing.</strong></h3><p><em>(S.2964-A-Kavanagh/A.1778-A-Lavine)</em></p><p>NYSAR/HGAR supports ensuring fairness and transparency in the cooperative housing purchase process by establishing a clear timeline for the response to applicants by co-op boards and requiring a reason for any denial of an application in order to help combat illegal housing discrimination.</p><h3 id="support-housing-access-voucher-program"><strong>Support: Housing Access Voucher Program</strong></h3><p><em>(S.568-A-Kavanagh/A.4021-A-Rosenthal)</em></p><p>NYSAR/HGAR supports establishing a Housing Access Voucher Program to provide rental assistance in the form of vouchers to low-income New Yorkers who are homeless or who face the risk of losing their homes.</p><h3 id="opposes-collecting-broker-fees"><strong>Opposes: Collecting Broker Fees</strong></h3><p><em>(S.2783-Brisport/A.4781-Mamdani)</em></p><p>NYSAR/HGAR opposes the prohibition of landlords and landlords’ agents from collecting broker fees from a tenant.</p><h3 id="opposes-good-cause-eviction"><strong>Opposes: Good Cause Eviction</strong></h3><p><em>(S.305-Salazar/A.4454-Hunter)</em></p><p>NYSAR/HGAR opposes the imposition of a statewide “Good Cause” eviction standard, which would implement impractical and overly restrictive standards and stifle investment in rental housing. It would also impose de facto rent control statewide and prevent a property owner from recovering their property even after a tenant’s lease has expired.</p><h3 id="logistics"><strong>Logistics</strong></h3><p>We have free two buses leaving on the morning of March 27<sup>th</sup> for your convenience. One bus departs from the HGAR White Plains office at 6 a.m., making a stop in Brewster at the DeCicco’s Parking Lot leaving at 6:40 a.m.</p><p>On the other side of the river, we have a bus leaving from West Nyack at the Macy’s parking lot at the Palisades Mall at 6 a.m., making a stop at the Newburgh Mall where it will depart at 7 a.m. Both buses will meet at the capital where we will be provided breakfast and strong words of encouragement before we go to Hearing Room A in the Legislative Office Building by 10 a.m. Afterward, we will be provided a lunch then board the buses home sometime in the mid-afternoon.</p><p>The night before, March 26<sup>th</sup>, RPAC is having a pre-Lobby Day fundraiser celebration.</p><p>All of this might be a little overwhelming and that is understandable. As a result before March 27<sup>th</sup>, I will be hosting an informational Zoom answering all questions about Lobby Day 2024. So, stay tuned and I look forward to seeing you on Lobby Day. </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The new PCDS includes new language that requires the disclosure of issues related to flooding, but most importantly, it removes the $500 credit/waiver, which would have been provided by the seller to the buyer if the seller failed or refused to provide the PCDS. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In September 2023, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a new law that modified the Property Condition Disclosure Statement and changed important requirements under the law, including the elimination of the $500 credit/waiver. <strong>This new law goes into effect on</strong> <strong>March 20, 2024</strong>, so I’m going to review what you need to know about this law and the new form.</p><p>In general, the new PCDS is to be used for properties that go under a contract for sale as of March 20, 2024. The prior exemptions for the property exchange still exist and have not changed (example: foreclosures, transfer by court order or bankruptcy, new construction, etc.).</p><p>Beginning on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, all licensees must use the new PCDS for any “residential property,” meaning any one to four-family improved dwelling being used as a residence or home. It does not include unimproved land, condos, co-ops, or property that is part of an HOA that is not owned in fee-simple by the seller that goes under contract of sale. Until that time, real estate agents are to continue to use the old form (until 3/19/24). Failure to use the correct form may result in liability to both sellers and licensees. In anticipation of the change, the state has provided the new form and HGAR members can find the new form and the old form in the HGAR Document Library.</p><h3 id="important-changes"><strong>Important Changes</strong></h3><p>The new PCDS includes new language that requires the disclosure of issues related to flooding, but most importantly, it removes the $500 credit/waiver, which would have been provided by the seller to the buyer if the seller failed or refused to provide the PCDS.</p><h3 id="duty-to-advise-of-obligations"><strong>Duty to Advise of Obligations</strong></h3><p>For agents listing a property, Section 466 of the Real Property Law states that the agent must inform their client of their obligations to fill out the PCDS. The same goes for the buyer’s agent, who needs to inform their buyer client they are entitled to receive a copy of the PCDS at some point before the buyer signs a binding contract of sale. It should be noted that if the buyer is not represented by an agent, the agent representing the seller must advise the buyer of his or her rights/obligations under the law.</p><p>If an agent performs these duties/obligations, the agent has satisfied their obligations under the law and they will not be liable to any party for a violation of the law.</p><h3 id="timing"><strong>Timing</strong></h3><p>The date of the listing agreement has no impact on whether the amended PCDS is required or which form is used. Under the law, every seller of residential property must complete and sign a PCDS and cause it, or a copy thereof, to be delivered to a buyer or buyer’s agent prior to the signing by the buyer of a binding contract of sale. Also, a copy of the PCDS containing the signatures of both the seller and the buyer must be attached to the contract of sale. This means that:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>If a contract of sale has already been fully executed with the old PCDS signed by both parties (or they agreed to provide the $500 credit/waiver) prior to 3/20/24, then the seller has met their obligation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a listing was taken prior to March 20, 2024, and the PCDS was provided by the seller, but it was not signed by the buyer prior to March 20, 2024, the new amended PCDS must be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the listing was taken prior to March 20, 2024, and the seller was going to opt for the $500 credit/waiver, if the contract of sale is not signed before March 20, 2024, then the seller would not be able to take advantage of the $500 credit/waiver and they would need to fill out and provide the new PCDS prior to the signing of a binding contract of sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the seller has already provided the PCDS to the buyer and the buyer has not signed the PCDS prior to March 20, 2024, the new PCDS is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the seller has not provided the PCDS and a binding contract of sale is entered into on or after March 20, 2024, the amended PCDS is required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In some circumstances, the new PCDS will not be required. Those situations are:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>If the seller has already provided the PCDS to the buyer and the buyer signed prior to March 20, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the seller and buyer entered into a binding contract of sale prior to March 20, 2024.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="best-practices-with-the-pcds"><strong>Best Practices With the PCDS</strong></h3><p>The following are some best practices to employ with the new PCDS:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Provide the PCDS at first substantive contact and instruct the homeowner to speak to their attorney on how to fill it out and deliver it to the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not assist in filling the form out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain that the PCDS will have to be provided to the buyer, signed, and attached to the contract of sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a buyer’s agent, tell your client that he is entitled to a copy of the PCDS, which he will have to sign and which will be attached to the contract of sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain to a homeowner that the old form will expire on March 19, 2024, and, unless the buyer signs the old PCDS by then, the new PCDS will have to be executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain to the homeowner that the $500 credit/waiver will expire on March 19, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell the homeowner that if the condition of the property changes subsequent to filling out the PCDS, but prior to the buyer signing the PCDS, it will need to be updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not require that the PCDS be provided back to the listing agent, either to list the property or at any time prior to there being an accepted offer. This could create liability on the part of the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a PCDS is presented to a buyer’s agent, that buyer’s agent should forward that document to the buyer and provide a copy to their attorney.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a PCDS is presented to a listing agent from the homeowner at or around the time that contract is to be signed, forward that document to the buyer’s agent instructing them to present it to their client and the buyer’s attorney.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pcds-forms-affirmation-and-new-listing-agreement-documents"><strong>PCDS Forms, Affirmation and New Listing Agreement Documents</strong></h3><p>HGAR maintains a document directory. Currently, that directory contains two sets of PCDSs. They are clearly marked as to when they are to be used (“<a href="https://www.hgar.com/api/document/preview/74631">Property Condition Disclosure Statement - effective until 3/19/2024</a>” and “<a href="https://www.hgar.com/api/document/preview/25974">Property Condition Disclosure Statement - effective 3/20/2024</a>”). Additionally, there are several sets of affirmations relating to the PCDS obligations of the buyer or seller that assist an agent in evidencing that they have provided the PCDS to their client, in satisfaction of the requirements under the law. Those forms also clearly identify which one is to be used prior to March 20, 2024, and which one is to be used after March 20, 2024.</p><p>Finally, as many of you already know, the Exclusive Right to Sell and the Exclusive Agency Agreements utilized by OneKey MLS have a provision related to the PCDS. Those provisions have been updated and those updated forms are now available. They too are clearly marked as to identify which one is to be used prior to March 20, 2024, and which one is to be used after March 20, 2024.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Timing is everything. Make sure you discuss these new changes with your client. As we approach the March 20, 2024 change, things might be tricky, so refer back to this article. Make sure you look at the calendar. Provide the correct documents, and ensure that you explain the current status of the law. After March 20, 2024, things will become much easier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[In addition to the financial payment, NAR has agreed to put in place a new MLS rule prohibiting offers of broker compensation on the MLS.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHICAGO—The National Association of Realtors announced an agreement has been reached that it states would end litigation of most of the claims brought on behalf of home sellers related to broker commissions. NAR has agreed to changes to its commission structure as part of the settlement terms, including putting in place a new MLS rule prohibiting offers of broker compensation on an MLS and enacting a new rule that would require MLS participants working with buyers to enter into written agreements with their buyers.</p><p>The agreement would resolve claims against NAR, over one million NAR members, all state/territorial and local REALTOR associations, all association-owned MLSs, and all brokerages with an NAR member as principal that had a residential transaction volume in 2022 of $2 billion or below. Under the terms of the agreement, NAR would pay $418 million over approximately four years. NAR stated on its website that it will determine how to allocate settlement funds as they become due, working closely with its Finance Committee.</p><p>The settlement, which is subject to court approval, makes clear that NAR continues to deny any wrongdoing in connection with the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) cooperative compensation model rule (MLS Model Rule) that was introduced in the 1990s in response to calls from consumer protection advocates for buyer representation.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1-e1704744285844-2-1-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1-e1704744285844-2-1-1.webp 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1-e1704744285844-2-1-1.webp 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NAR President Kevin Sears</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">TTThe</span></figcaption></figure><p>NAR stated in its announcement that it fought to include all members in the settlement release and was able to ensure more than one million members are included. However, despite NAR’s efforts, agents affiliated with HomeServices of America and its related companies—the last corporate defendant still litigating the Sitzer-Burnett case—are not released under the settlement, nor are employees of the remaining corporate defendants named in the cases covered by this settlement.</p><p>“NAR has worked hard for years to resolve this litigation in a manner that benefits our members and American consumers. It has always been our goal to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible. This settlement achieves both of those goals,” said Nykia Wright, Interim CEO of NAR.</p><p>Two critical achievements of this resolution are the release of most NAR members and many industry stakeholders from liability in these matters and the fact that cooperative compensation remains a choice for consumers when buying or selling a home. NAR also secured in the agreement a mechanism for nearly all brokerage entities that had a residential transaction volume in 2022 that exceeded $2 billion and MLSs not wholly owned by Realtor associations to obtain releases efficiently if they choose to use it.</p><p>In addition to the financial payment, NAR has agreed to put in place a new MLS rule prohibiting offers of broker compensation on the MLS. This would mean that offers of broker compensation could not be communicated via the MLS, but they could continue to be an option consumers can pursue off-MLS through negotiation and consultation with real estate professionals. Offers of compensation help make professional representation more accessible, decrease costs for home buyers to secure these services, increase fair housing opportunities, and increase the potential buyer pool for sellers. They are also consistent with the real estate laws in the many states that expressly authorize them.</p><p>Further, NAR has agreed to enact a new rule that would require MLS participants working with buyers to enter into written agreements with their buyers. NAR continues, as it has done for years, to encourage its members to use buyer brokerage agreements that help consumers understand exactly what services and value will be provided, and for how much. These changes will go into effect in mid-July 2024.</p><p>“Ultimately, continuing to litigate would have hurt members and their small businesses,” said Wright. “While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR. For over a century, NAR has protected and advanced the right to real property ownership in this country, and we remain focused on delivering on that core mission.”</p><p>“NAR exists to serve our members and American consumers, and while the settlement comes at a significant cost, we believe the benefits it will provide to our industry are worth that cost,” said Kevin Sears, NAR President. “NAR is focused firmly on the future and on leading this industry forward. We are committed to innovation and defining the next steps that will allow us to continue providing unmatched value to members and American consumers. This will be a time of adjustment, but the fundamentals will remain: buyers and sellers will continue to have many choices when deciding to buy or sell a home, and NAR members will continue to use their skill, care, and diligence to protect the interests of their clients.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHICAGO—In response to recent press reports that characterized its settlement in broker commission litigation brought by homeowners as “the end of the 6% commission,” the National Association of Realtors issued a lengthy statement today that it does not set commissions—they are negotiable.</p><p>NAR President Kevin Sears in an email message to NAR members stated that since Friday’s settlement announcement, many members have reached out to its Leadership Team with questions. He noted that there has been “persistent inaccurate reporting suggesting that NAR rules set commissions at 6%.”</p><p>“The rule that has been the subject of litigation requires only that listing brokers communicate an offer of compensation.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales climbed in February, according to a report released today by the National Association of Realtors. Among the four major U.S. regions, sales jumped in the West, South and Midwest, and were unchanged in the Northeast. Year-over-year, sales declined in all regions.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—bounced 9.5% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.38 million in February. Year-over-year, sales slid 3.3% (down from 4.53 million in February 2023).</p><p>“Additional housing supply is helping to satisfy market demand,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Housing demand has been on a steady rise due to population and job growth, though the actual timing of purchases will be determined by prevailing mortgage rates and wider inventory choices.”</p><p>Total U.S. housing inventory registered at the end of February was 1.07 million units, up 5.9% from January and 10.3% from one year ago (970,000). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.9-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 3.0 months in January but up from 2.6 months in February 2023.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in February was $384,500, an increase of 5.7% from the prior year ($363,600). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown"><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>At 480,000 units, existing-home sales in the Northeast were identical to January but down 7.7% from February 2023. It's the fourth consecutive month that home sales in the Northeast registered 480,000 units. The median price in the Northeast was $420,600, up 11.5% from one year ago.</p><p>“Due to inventory constraints, the Northeast was the regional underperformer in February home sales but the best performer in home prices,” Yun added. “More supply is clearly needed to help stabilize home prices and get more Americans moving to their next residences.”</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales rose 8.4% from one month ago to an annual rate of 1.03 million in February, down 3.7% from the previous year. The median price in the Midwest was $277,600, up 6.8% from February 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South leapt 9.8% from January to an annual rate of 2.02 million in February, down 2.9% from one year earlier.

The median price in the West was $593,000, up 9.1% from February 2023.</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index"><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 38 days in February, up from 36 days in January and 34 days in February 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 26% of sales in February, down from 28% in January and 27% in February 2023.

    <description><![CDATA[The settlement achieves two important goals: protecting members to the greatest extent possible and preserving consumer choice.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: This article first appeared in <em>Realtor Magazine</em>.</p><p>The national conversation around real estate commissions reached a crescendo in the last week since the National Association of Realtors announced a settlement agreement that would resolve litigation brought on behalf of home sellers related to broker commissions. Brokers and agents have their own questions about what comes next for their businesses, while at the same time trying to answer consumer inquiries. And many headlines aren’t separating fact from fiction, feeding misinformation to you and your clients.</p><p>Let’s clear the air: There’s no doubt the litigation—including copycat lawsuits that were filed after the Sitzer-Burnett verdict—caused considerable uncertainty in an industry already dealing with the effects of low inventory and interest rate increases. The settlement, which must be approved by a judge, provides a path forward for real estate professionals, Realtor associations, brokerages, MLSs and other industry stakeholders. Most importantly, it gives NAR members the chance to refocus on their core mission to support buyers and sellers.</p><h3 id="facts-first"><strong>Facts First</strong></h3><p>There’s much the media has gotten wrong about NAR’s settlement, which would require the association to pay $418 million over four years. Some outlets have suggested that NAR previously set or guided commissions to a standard rate of 6%. Even President Joe Biden, in recent comments, misspoke in suggesting that the settlement makes commissions negotiable for the first time.</p><p>You know that is false. NAR does not set commissions, and commissions were negotiable long before this settlement. They are and will remain entirely negotiable between brokers and their clients. And housing prices are dictated by market forces beyond members’ control.</p><p>Getting the facts right is important, especially because the settlement agreement is complex. NAR is continuing to engage with the media to correct inaccurate reporting about the settlement. Members are also encouraged to refer to official NAR sources, like <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts" rel="noreferrer"><strong>facts.realtor</strong></a>, for the most accurate and up-to-date information about the settlement and what it means for consumers.</p><p>The settlement achieves two important goals: protecting members to the greatest extent possible and preserving consumer choice. The proposed settlement:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolves claims against NAR and nearly every member; all state, territorial and local Realtor associations; all association-owned MLSs; and all brokerages with an NAR member as principal whose residential transaction volume in 2022 was $2 billion or below.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserves cooperative compensation as an option for consumers looking to buy or sell a home—as long as such offers of compensation occur off of the MLS.</p><p>NAR fought for a release that covered all industry players, but large settlements reached by other corporate defendants shaped the negotiations. Throughout the settlement process, NAR also engaged with a diverse range of members to consider their perspectives and interests.</p><p>“Ultimately, continuing to litigate would have hurt members and their small businesses,” NAR Interim CEO Nykia Wright said in a statement. “While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR. For over a century, NAR has protected and advanced the right to real property ownership in this country, and we remain focused on delivering on that core mission.”</p><p><strong>How To Know If You’re Covered</strong></p><p>Nearly every member is covered by the release NAR negotiated in the settlement. The members not covered are those affiliated with HomeServices of America, the last co-defendant in the Sitzer-Burnett litigation, and the employees of the co-defendants in the Gibson and Umpa cases.</p><p>If you are affiliated with any of the following brokerage groups and are an independent contractor licensee, you are covered by the proposed settlement, even if your brokerage may not be covered:</p><p>At World Properties LLC<br>Compass Inc.<br>Douglas Elliman Inc.<br>Douglas Elliman Realty LLC<br>eXp Realty LLC<br>eXp World Holdings Inc.<br>Hanna Holdings Inc.<br>HomeSmart International LLC<br>Howard Hanna Real Estate Services<br>Real Broker LLC<br>The Real Brokerage Inc.<br>Realty ONE Group Inc.<br>Redfin Corporation<br>United Real Estate<br>Weichert, REALTORS®</p><p>All other Realtors who are members of NAR on the date of class notice are covered by the release. The date of class notice is anticipated to be in mid-July.</p><p>Members on the date of class notice and state/territorial and local Realtor associations must abide by the practice changes set forth in the agreement, but they do not need to take any other action in order to benefit from the negotiated release.</p><p>The release does not cover brokerage firms with residential transaction volume above $2 billion in 2022, despite NAR’s effort to include them. For those companies, the settlement provides an avenue to pursue inclusion in the release but does not obligate them to do so.</p><h3 id="changing-business-practices"><strong>Changing Business Practices</strong></h3><p>The settlement agreement also mandates two key changes to the way members and MLS participants do business.</p><ol>
<li>NAR agreed to create a new MLS rule prohibiting offers of compensation on the MLS. This would mean that offers of compensation could not be communicated via an MLS, but they could continue to be an option consumers could pursue off-MLS through negotiation and consultation with real estate professionals.</li>
<li>NAR also agreed to create a new rule requiring MLS participants working with buyers to enter into written representation agreements with their buyers before the buyer tours a home. NAR has long encouraged its members to use written agreements to help consumers understand exactly what services and value they provide, and for how much.</li>
</ol>
<p>NAR continues to deny any wrongdoing and maintains that cooperative compensation is in the best interest of consumers. NAR members can use these changes as an opportunity to explain their clients’ options. Both changes would go into effect in mid-July under the terms of the proposed settlement.</p><p>NAR considered a range of legal options throughout the litigation process, including reaching a settlement or continuing to appeal the Sitzer-Burnett verdict and litigate the related copycat cases. The latter could have forced the association to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, leaving members, associations, MLSs and brokerages exposed.</p><h3 id="resources-for-members"><strong>Resources for Members</strong></h3><p>NAR is committed to supporting members through these changes. Members can get the facts about the settlement at <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts"><strong>facts.realtor</strong></a>, which is regularly updated with new information and resources, including FAQs.</p><p>For those who want to prepare for the new MLS rule requiring buyer representation agreements, consider taking the Accredited Buyer’s Representative (ABR) designation course, which NAR is offering to members at no cost through the end of the year.</p><p>“NAR exists to serve our members and American consumers, and while the settlement comes at a significant cost, we believe the benefits it will provide to our industry are worth that cost,” NAR President Kevin Sears said in a statement. “NAR is focused firmly on the future and on leading this industry forward. We are committed to innovation and defining the next steps that will allow us to continue providing unmatched value to members and American consumers.</p><p>Sears continued, “This will be a time of adjustment, but the fundamentals remain: Buyers and sellers will continue to have many choices when deciding to buy or sell a home, and NAR members will continue to use their skill, care and diligence to protect the interests of their clients.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA, CA—Elevated mortgage interest rates, still-high home prices and falling rents have made it more affordable to rent than buy in all of the top 50 U.S. metros, according to the Realtor.com Rental Report released on March 26.&nbsp;</p><p>In February, the mortgage payment on a starter home in the largest metros cost $1,027 (+60.1%) more than the monthly rent in those markets, on average. At the same time last year, 45 metros favored renting.&nbsp;</p><p>The top 10 metros with the largest rent versus buy savings (see below for top 50 metros):</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Austin-Round Rock-Georgetown, TX – $2,165 monthly rent savings (141.5% difference)</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA. – $2,422 (121.1%)</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, AZ – $1,528 (99.0%)</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA – $2,689 (95.5%)</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA – $2,539 (89.7%)</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA – $2,780 (86.7%)</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN – $1,366 (86.0%)</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR, WA– $1,396 (84.4%)</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom, CA&nbsp; –&nbsp; $1,514 (82.1%)</p><p>10.&nbsp; Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX– $1,103 (80.0%)&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Realtor.com report, the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA market posted a median rent of $2,852 in February, as compared to the Monthly Buy Cost of $4,995, for a savings of $2,143 and a 75% cost difference.&nbsp;</p><p>"With rents continuing to fall and the cost of buying a home remaining high, exacerbated by the rise in mortgage rates in the latter half of 2023, renting a home is now a more cost-effective option in all major U.S. markets," said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com. "Deciding whether to rent or buy often goes beyond a financial advantage though, and likely depends on a consumer's circumstances. </p><p>Renters often prize flexibility while the biggest reasons homebuyers cite are that they want a place of their own and to be closer to family and friends. The financial scales have tipped monthly costs in favor of renting over buying, but it does not bring the benefit of housing wealth gains over time that owning does and movers should consider their long-term housing plans and personal situation as they make this decision."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Overall Advantage of Renting Continues to Grow in Most Markets</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In February, the cost of buying a starter home in the top 50 metros was $1,027 (60.1%) higher than renting one; comparatively, the cost to buy was $865 higher than renting in February 2023—a $162 higher monthly savings from renting compared to the prior year. The savings are mostly driven by declining rent prices and higher buying costs, especially interest rates—the 30-year fixed mortgage rate remained elevated at 6.78% in February 2024 compared to 6.26% 12 months ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The advantages of renting have become more pronounced across the top metros. Looking specifically at the top 10 metros that favor renting over buying, the average monthly costs for buying a starter home were $1,950 (95.6%) higher than rents—nearly double the cost. Those metros are mostly markets with a higher concentration of tech workers and high earners, where both the average rent and buy costs are higher than the national average.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Renting Beats Buying in All Major Metros&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In February, median rents fell across all unit sizes. Despite seven months of annual rent declines, median rents are still $252 (17.3%) higher than the same time in 2020, before the onset of the pandemic. Last February, 45 metros favored renting, but over the past 12 months Memphis, TN, Birmingham, AL, Pittsburgh, PA, St. Louis, MO and Baltimore, MD metros flipped from favoring buying to favoring renting. Four out of five of those markets were among the top markets seeing a high share of investor activity, which may have accelerated the growth of home prices there and increased the overall costs of buying a home, tilting those markets further toward favoring renting over buying.&nbsp;</p><p>Austin, TX, where the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $3,695—141.5% more than the monthly rent of $1,530, for a monthly savings of $2,165—topped the list of markets most favoring renting. Other top markets favoring renting over buying were Seattle, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Metros with diminishing rental advantages were San Jose, CA, Dallas; San Francisco; Columbus, OH; Miami; and Minneapolis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Methodology</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Rental data as of February 2024 for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com. Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). The study used rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>The monthly cost of buying a home was calculated by averaging the median listing prices of studio, 1-bed, and 2-bed homes, weighted by the number of listings, in each housing market. Monthly buying costs assume an 8% down payment, with a mortgage rate of 6.78%, and include taxes, insurance and HOA fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The Northeast PHSI decreased 0.3% from last month to 63.4, a decline of 9.0% from February 2023.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in January grew 1.6%, according to statistics released today (March 28) by the National Association of Realtors. The Midwest and South posted monthly gains in transactions while the Northeast and West recorded losses. All four U.S. regions registered year-over-year decreases.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI)—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—increased to 75.6 in February. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 7.0%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.&nbsp;</p><p>“While modest sales growth might not stir excitement, it shows slow and steady progress from the lows of late last year,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Ongoing job gains are clearly increasing demand along with more inventory.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Northeast PHSI decreased 0.3% from last month to 63.4, a decline of 9.0% from February 2023. The Midwest index soared 10.6% to 81.6 in February, down 2.5% from one year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The South PHSI rose 1.1% to 89.5 in February, falling 8.5% from the prior year. The West index fell 6.5% in February to 57.1, down 7.9% from February 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>“The high-cost regions in the Northeast and West experienced pullbacks due to affordability challenges,” added Yun. “Home prices rising faster than income growth is not healthy and adds challenges for first-time buyers.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yun further noted, “There will be a steady rise in inventory from recent growth in home building. Additionally, many sellers, who delayed listing in the past two years, will begin to put their homes on the market to move to a different home that better fits their new life circumstances—such as changes in family composition, jobs, commuting patterns and retirees wanting to be closer to their grandkids.”&nbsp;</p><p>Pending contracts are good early indicators of upcoming sales closings. However, the amount of time between pending contracts and completed sales is not identical for all home sales. Variations in the length of the process from pending contract to closed sale can be caused by issues such as buyer difficulties with obtaining mortgage financing, home inspection problems, or appraisal issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The index is based on a sample that covers about 40% of multiple listing service data each month. In developing the model for the index, it was demonstrated that the level of monthly sales-contract activity parallels the level of closed existing-home sales in the following two months.&nbsp;</p><p>An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which was the first year to be examined. By coincidence, the volume of existing-home sales in 2001 fell within the range of 5.0 to 5.5 million, which is considered normal for the current U.S. population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Approximately 110 HGAR members participated in the New York State Association of Realtors’ Annual Lobby Day program on March 27]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—For the second year in a row, more than 100 members of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors traveled to Albany to convene with state lawmakers to discuss such topics as the state’s housing crisis, Good Cause Eviction, fairness in cooperative transactions, insurance discrimination, broker fees, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Approximately 110 HGAR members participated in the New York State Association of Realtors’ Annual Lobby Day program on March 27. After attending a NYSAR-led session, the HGAR contingent met with members of the New York City and Hudson Valley state delegations and presented the association’s legislative priorities for this session. State Assemblymen and Senators arrived at various times at Hearing Room A at the New York State Legislative Office Building to meet with Realtors during the final days of budget negotiations. Later that day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she was seeking approval from the legislature to extend the budget deadline from April 1 to April 4.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors contingent was led by Legislative Council Co-Chairs Leah Caro and Matthew Engel, HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez, Eliezer Rodriguez, HGAR’s Regional Director of Government Affairs and Alexander Roithmayr, HGAR Director of Government Affairs.&nbsp;</p><p>Caro, who served as the moderator/emcee of the give-and-take dialogue between HGAR and the state legislators, said the number of lawmakers who attended the session at Hearing Room A was the largest in memory. The session provided a lively conversation and thoughtful listening by all parties about HGAR’s legislative priorities, including housing affordability and supply, co-op transparency, the telemarketing ban, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our elected officials literally thanked us for showing up and speaking out. Lobby Day is critical for furthering the conversation about housing in New York State; and the Realtors of HGAR demonstrated our strength on our issues for the lower Hudson Valley, the Bronx and Manhattan,” Caro said.&nbsp;</p><p>She added, “We have wonderful allies in the Senate and Assembly who understand our issues and want to do what's best for our counties, its current and future residents, and its hard-working Realtors.”&nbsp;</p><p>Attending her first Lobby Day as HGAR CEO, Fernandez shared, “I am very impressed with the spectacular attendance of HGAR members and leaders at Lobby Day. HGAR is committed to advocating for homeownership, including fair and affordable housing. Our members' participation in Albany and our meetings with multiple legislators reflects that commitment.”&nbsp;</p><p>HGAR’s Roithmayr agreed with Caro that the rolling dialogue with almost every state representative from the HGAR market area was lively and lasted more than two hours. “Our HGAR members did their best work advocating for actual housing crisis solutions, including the First Time Home Buyers Saving Programs and Housing Access Vouchers, while educating the Senators and Assembly Members on how Good Cause Eviction would make the housing crisis worse. Time will tell how effective our messaging was, but our attendance and the attention we received from our elected officials is a testament to the power, strength and determination of Realtors, at least in our part of New York State,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Hudson Valley lawmakers that attended the Lobby Day session with HGAR included: Senator Shelley Mayer (37<sup>th</sup> District); Senator Bill Weber (38<sup>th</sup> District); Senator Pete Harckham (40<sup>th</sup> District); and Senator James Skoufis (42<sup>nd</sup> District). Assembly Members that attended were: Assembly Member Amy Paulin (88<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member Gary Pretlow (89<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member Nader Sayegh (90<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member Steve Otis (91<sup>st</sup> District);Assembly Member Maryjane Shimsky (92<sup>nd</sup> District); Assembly Member Chris Burdick (93<sup>rd</sup> District); Assembly Member Matt Slater (94<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member Dana Levenberg (95<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member Ken Zebrowski (96<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member John McGowan (97<sup>th</sup> District); Assembly Member Aileen Gunther (100<sup>th</sup> District) and&nbsp; Assembly Member Jonathan Jacobson (104<sup>th</sup> District).&nbsp;</p><p>The following lawmakers representing areas of New York City in the HGAR market area attended the HGAR session: Senator Luis Sepulveda (District 32); Senator Nathalia Fernandez (District 34); Assembly Member Landon Dais (AD-77); Assembly Member George Alvarez (AD-78); Assembly Member Chantel Jackson (AD-79); Assembly Member John Zaccaro (AD-80); Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz (AD-81); Assembly Member Michael Benedetto (AD-82); Assembly Member Kenny Burgos (AD-85) and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia (AD-86).&nbsp;</p><p>HGAR’s Rodriguez noted that the few state lawmakers from the Hudson Valley and New York City that were not able to join HGAR in-person at Hearing Room A were e-mailed a copy of the association’s Legislative Priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the state elected members that stopped by Hearing Room A, HGAR’s Crystal Hawkins-Syska and Rey Hollingsworth Falu, along with the NYSAR leadership team, met with State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins.&nbsp; Also, along with the NYSAR leadership that included Mike Kelly and Duncan Mackenzie, HGAR’s Fernandez, Caro, Engel, and Rodriguez met with Counsel to Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, Miguelina Camilo. Rodriguez also had a separate discussion and sent HGAR’s Legislative Priorities to Senator Jamaal Bailey, (District 36); Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia, (AD-86); Assembly Member Al Taylor, (AD-71) and Assembly Member Edwards Gibbs, (AD-68).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: To access details of HGAR’s 2024 Legislative priorities, please go to <a href="https://realestateindepth.com/legislative-affairs-countdown-to-lobby-day-2024/">https://realestateindepth.com/legislative-affairs-countdown-to-lobby-day-2024/</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—To no one’s surprise since it is among the top topics of discussion in the real estate industry along with hoped-for interest rate cuts, the meeting room at the headquarters of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors was filled to capacity on April 3 to learn the latest on the National Association of Realtors’ broker commission lawsuit settlement and its implications for the real estate industry going forward.</p><p>The program was presented by HGAR’s Broker-Owner-Manager Committee, which is co-chaired by Rey Hollingsworth Falu and Tanya Riggs, and featured Matt Troiani, Senior Counsel, Director of Legal Affairs for the National Association of Realtors.

Commissions continue to be negotiable.”</p><p>He offered the following highlights of the NAR settlement:</p><h3 id="release-of-liability"><strong>Release of Liability&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The agreement would resolve claims against NAR, over one million NAR members, all state/territorial and local Realtor associations, all association-owned Multiple Listing Services, and all brokerage entities with an NAR member as principal that had a residential transaction volume in 2022 of $2 billion or below.</li>
<li>The agreement provides a mechanism for nearly all brokerage entities that had a residential transaction volume in 2022 that exceeded $2 billion to obtain releases efficiently if they choose to use it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-is-covered-by-the-settlement">&nbsp;Who is Covered by the Settlement?</h3><ul>
<li>If you are a Realtor and are affiliated with a brokerage group that is not discussed below, you are covered (even if your brokerage may not be covered)</li>
<li>Affiliated with any of the following brokerage groups, and are an independent contractor, you are covered (even if your brokerage may not be covered)—At World Properties, LLC; Compass, Inc.; Douglas Elliman, Inc.; Douglas Elliman Realty, LLC; eXp Realty, LLC; eXp World Holdings, Inc.; Hanna Holdings, Inc.; HomeSmart International, LLC; Howard Hanna Real Estate Services; Real Broker, LLC; The Real Brokerage, Inc.; Realty ONE Group, Inc.; Redfin Corporation; United Real Estate; and Weichert, Realtors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The only entity not covered by the settlement and who at present cannot opt into the settlement is HomeServices of America and its related companies—the last corporate defendants in the broker commission lawsuits.</p><h3 id="written-agreements-for-mls-participants-acting-for-buyers">&nbsp;<strong>Written Agreements for MLS Participants Acting for Buyers</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The settlement provides that MLS participants working with buyers must enter into written agreements with those buyers.</li>
<li>This change will go into effect in mid-July 2024.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="settlement-payment"><strong>Settlement Payment&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Under the terms of the agreement, NAR would pay $418 million over approximately four years.</li>
<li>NAR’s membership dues for 2024 and 2025 will not change because of this payment.</li>
<li>Troiani said he does not expect a final decision to be rendered on the court settlement until December 2024 at the earliest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nar-continues-to-deny-any-wrongdoing"><strong>NAR Continues to Deny Any Wrongdoing&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The settlement, which is subject to court approval, makes clear that NAR continues to deny any wrongdoing in connection with the MLS cooperative compensation model rule (MLS Model Rule) that was introduced in the 1990s in response to calls from consumer protection advocates for buyer representation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="offers-of-compensation-prohibited-from-the-mls">&nbsp;<strong>Offers of Compensation Prohibited from the MLS</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;NAR has agreed to put in place a new rule prohibiting offers of compensation on the MLS.</p><ul>
<li>There will continue to be many ways in which buyer brokers could be compensated, including through offers of compensation communicated off MLS—as NAR has long believed that it is in the interests of the sellers, buyers, and their brokers to make offers of compensation—but using the MLS to communicate offers of compensation would no longer be an option.</li>
<li>The types of compensation available for buyer brokers would continue to take multiple forms, depending on broker-consumer negotiations, including but not limited to:</li>
<li>Fixed-fee commission paid directly by consumers.</li>
<li>Portion of the listing broker’s compensation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This change will go into effect in mid-July 2024.</p><h3 id="written-agreements-for-mls-participants-acting-for-buyers-1"><strong>Written Agreements for MLS Participants Acting for Buyers</strong>&nbsp;</h3><ul>
<li>The settlement provides that MLS participants working with buyers must enter into written agreements with those buyers before touring a home.</li>
<li>NAR has long encouraged its members to use written agreements because they help consumers understand exactly what services and value will be provided, and for how much.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps-in-the-settlement-process">&nbsp;<strong>Next Steps in the Settlement Process</strong>&nbsp;</h3><ul>
<li>The settlement is subject to court approval, which is a process that NAR expects to take several months or more and will include an opportunity for interested parties to object.</li>
<li>To opt into the settlement, Realtor-owned MLSs, brokerages above the $2-billion threshold who are opting in, and non-Realtor MLSs need to execute an appendix.</li>
<li>The practice changes will go into effect in mid-July 2024.</li>
<li>NAR will move to have litigation about the MLS cooperative compensation Model Rule stayed, or paused, as to NAR pending the settlement approval process.</li>

<li>A brokerage can elect to pay an amount based on a pre-determined formula based on that brokerage’s residential transactional volume.</li>
<li>A brokerage can elect to participate in non-binding mediation within 110 days following the preliminary approval of the settlement.</li>
<li>They can choose not to settle.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Levine added that for non-association MLs, they have three options as well:</p><ol>
<li>The MLS can elect to pay an amount based on a pre-determined formula based on the number of MLS participants.</li>
<li>The MLS can elect to participate in non-binding mediation within 110 days following preliminary approval of the settlement.</li>
<li>They can choose not to settle.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of the new Property Condition Disclosure Statement, which went into effect on March 20, 2024, Gatto and Levine advised that all licensees must use the new PCDS for any “residential property,” meaning any one to four-family improved dwelling being used as a residence or home. It does not include unimproved land, condos, co-ops, or property that is part of an HOA that is not owned in fee-simple by the seller that goes under contract of sale.</p><p>In anticipation of the change, the state has provided the new form and HGAR members can find the new form and the old form in the HGAR Document Library.

    <description><![CDATA[While specifics of the housing-related legislation were not released, City & State New York reports that sources indicate some carve-outs of the Good Cause Eviction proposal have angered tenant groups, while other provisions included have drawn the ire of landlords.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—The week began in Albany with the news that Gov. Kathy Hochul and leaders of the Senate and Assembly have agreed to a “conceptual agreement” on key priorities in the estimated $237-billion Fiscal Year 2025 New York State Budget. Included in this framework are some provisions of the controversial ‘Good Cause” eviction legislation, as well as a replacement for the 421a tax incentive in New York City.</p><p>“I promised to fight the right fights for New Yorkers, deliver common sense solutions, and tackle the thorny issues that others might ignore, and that's exactly what we’ve done,” Gov. Hochul said in a prepared statement. “We’re delivering on a common-sense agenda: fighting crime, fixing our mental health system, and building more housing so people can finally afford to live in New York.”</p><p>While specifics of the housing-related legislation were not released, <em>City &amp; State New York</em> reports that sources indicate some carve-outs of the Good Cause Eviction proposal have angered tenant groups, while other provisions included have drawn the ire of landlords. State lawmakers passed a fifth budget extender on Monday that expires this Thursday, giving the governor and legislators a few more days to finalize the framework they have agreed to. The state budget deadline was April 1.</p><p>According to the governor, among the highlights of the conceptual agreement include:</p><ul>
<li>The agreement addresses New York’s housing crisis by creating a new 485x tax incentive for affordable housing; extending the 421a incentive for projects already in the pipeline; making it easier to convert unused office space into affordable housing; eliminating outdated density caps in New York City; unlocking the potential of units that have been vacant since 2019 and establishing a new law to protect tenants from price gouging.</li>
<li>Creating a statewide tax incentive for multi-family housing; making $650 million in discretionary funds exclusively available to Pro-Housing Communities; providing incentives for communities that want more accessory dwelling units; investing $500 million to develop up to 15,000 new housing units on state-owned sites and protecting homeowners from deed theft.</li>
<li>Cracking down on retail theft by increasing penalties for offenders who assault retail workers; $40.2 million for retail theft enforcement; and a $3,000 tax credit for business owners to invest in security resources.</li>
<li>Shutting down illicit cannabis storefronts by authorizing the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) to padlock businesses for a full year; allowing local governments to pass laws to execute padlock orders; establishing fines for landlords knowingly renting to retailers selling cannabis without a license.</li>
<li>Maintaining the state’s $3.9-billion commitment to support distressed hospitals and $20 billion multi-year investment to build new healthcare infrastructure, expand Medicare coverage for seniors and pregnant New Yorkers and increase the home care worker minimum wage.</li>
<li>Providing critical funding support to mass transit systems statewide, including $7.9 billion in operating aid for the MTA, $333 million for upstate transit systems, and $551 million for non-MTA downstate systems, a 5.4% increase in funding.</li>
<li>Contributing $2.6 billion for the third year of a record $32.9-billion five-year DOT Capital Plan, funding projects that are reconnecting communities across the state, and $100 million for local programs through the CHIPS program.</li>
<li>Making record environmental investments with $500 million for clean water, $400 million for the Environmental Protection Fund, and $47 million to support the governor's goal to plant 25 million trees by 2033.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on a preliminary assessment of the negotiated changes to the governor’s original budget proposal, the total budget for FY 2025 is currently estimated at $237 billion. The FY 2025 budget does not raise income or statewide business taxes and maintains state reserves at the gold standard of 15%.</p><p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams released a statement in reaction to the news of a conceptual budget agreement. He stated, “This budget will be a win for New Yorkers. Every day, this administration works to deliver on our vision that supports working-class families by protecting public safety, rebuilding our economy, and making this city more livable. As a result, crime is down, jobs are up, and our administration continues to deliver each day for everyday New Yorkers. But we’ve been clear that we need additional support from our partners in Albany to fully realize those goals and today we celebrate as most of our key asks were granted by our state partners.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New York has gone to great lengths to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. All licensees are now tasked with ensuring all members of the public are treated with equity to ensure that steering and all other forms of discrimination are rooted out and eliminated.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April is Fair Housing Month, so let’s take a look at all things relating to fair housing.</p><p>Back in 2019, <em>Newsday</em>, after conducting a three-year investigation, published “Long Island Divided,” an expose´ that uncovered discriminatory real estate practices performed by real estate licensees. These practices targeted certain protected classes by providing unequal treatment when those members of the public sought properties. As a result of this expose´, as well as other fair housing issues that were being uncovered, New York legislators decided it was necessary for them to become involved. Since that time, they have established a series of laws designed to prevent discrimination in the housing industry and bolster fair housing.</p><h3 id="protected-classes"><strong>Protected Classes</strong></h3><p>Currently, there are seven protected federal classes. They are:</p><ul>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>National Origin</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Familial Status</li>
<li>Disability</li>
<li>Sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation)</li>
</ul>
<p>In New York, the current protected classes have increased to 16. They are:</p><ul>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Creed</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>National origin</li>
<li>Sexual orientation</li>
<li>Gender identity or expression</li>
<li>Military status</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Disability</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Lawful source of income</li>
<li>Familial status</li>
<li>Status as a victim of domestic violence</li>
<li>Immigration status</li>
<li>Citizenship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fair-housing-and-anti-discrimination-form"><strong>Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination Form</strong></h3><p>The NY Housing and Anti-Discrimination Form (HADF) was created in 2020. The purpose of the form is to advise any consumer (buyer, tenant, seller, landlord) of New York’s anti-discrimination policies under the law. The form discusses how it is unlawful to discriminate, how real estate licensees are required to comply with the law, and how/where a consumer can file a complaint if they believe that they are being discriminated against. It is required to be provided to all consumers and applies to all property types. It must be provided at “first substantive contact” and a copy of the notice must be retained for at least three years by the licensee.</p><h3 id="fair-housing-and-anti-discrimination-notice"><strong>Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination Notice</strong></h3><p>The Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination Notice is an additional safeguard regarding inappropriate discriminatory practices. Under 19 NYCRR §175.29, all real estate brokers are required to post the fair housing law notice in the window of all their offices and branch offices or otherwise have it “prominently posted.” This notice is provided by the New York Division of Licensing. This notice must also be posted at all open houses. Further, they must “prominently and conspicuously” display<strong> </strong>a link to it on the homepage of all the websites managed for the brokerage and/or its agents.</p><h3 id="standard-operating-procedures"><strong>Standard Operating Procedures</strong></h3><p>As a result of the discriminatory practices uncovered over the years, a new regulation was put in place to create transparency for those who were looking to purchase a property (buyers only, not renters). This new regulation requires that all brokerages establish Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). These procedures boil down to whether the brokerage will mandatorily require the production of three possible items from a prospective buyer. The three items were:</p><ul>
<li>Identification</li>
<li>Exclusive broker agreement</li>
<li>Pre-approval for a mortgage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The brokerage can choose to require all, some, or none of these items. All agents within the brokerage must follow the brokerage’s rule and they cannot establish their own SOP. If the brokerage requires a certain item, that item will be required from all prospective buyers. If the SOP indicates that the item is not required, the agents can request the item, but they are still required to work with that buyer in the event that the buyer refuses to provide the item.</p><p>Not only is the brokerage required to keep a copy of their notarized SOP, but they must post their SOP in a “clear and conspicuous” manner on all their broker websites and mobile applications and make a copy available upon request.</p><p><strong>Reasonable Modification and Accommodations</strong></p><p>In order to further protect those prospective renters with disabilities, real estate licensees must provide a notice that sets forth the rights a disabled individual has to request reasonable modifications or accommodations to or in their “housing accommodation.”</p><p>“Housing accommodation” is defined as “…any building, structure, or portion thereof which is used or occupied or is intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied, as the home, residence or sleeping place of one or more human beings.” This notice is to be provided at “first substantive contact,” similar to the fair housing notices. This notice can be provided in person or electronically and it must be posted in every vacant housing unit available for rent. Additionally, housing providers, including brokerages, agents and team websites, must prominently and conspicuously display on the homepage of their websites a link to the notice.</p><h3 id="licensing-requirements"><strong>Licensing Requirements</strong></h3><p>With an eye toward increasing education relating to fair housing, the New York legislature increased the requirements to obtain a broker license to 152 total hours and a salesperson course hour requirement to 77 hours, with six hours focused on fair housing for salespersons. It further required instructors to provide an oath that they are teaching their courses in compliance with New York state licensing parameters.</p><p>The state also created an additional $30 surcharge to the license fee for real estate brokers and an additional $10 surcharge to the license fee for real estate salespersons, which is to be applied toward the anti-discrimination in housing fund. They also increased the maximum fine for real estate license violations from $1,000 to $2,000. These funds would also be applied to the anti-discrimination in housing fund.</p><h3 id="continuing-education"><strong>Continuing Education</strong></h3><p>Possibly the biggest change the state made is to the continuing education requirement for all real estate licensees. Of the 22.5 hours required by all real estate licensees every two years, licensees are now required to complete two hours of cultural competency and two hours of implicit bias. They are further required to complete three hours of fair housing. Add to that, 2.5-hours of business ethics and one-hour of agency law, this leaves agents with 11 hours of free electives.</p><h3 id="other-developments"><strong>Other Developments</strong></h3><p>To ensure that agents remain compliant with all the recent developments, including the new fair housing laws, New York now requires that all office managers possess the proper experience to oversee all the brokerage’s licensees. As such, all supervisors must be an associate broker for at least two years before assuming the role of office manager and their obligation to supervise the office agents is similar to that of the broker.</p><p>The state also amended the NYS Human Rights Law concerning unlawful discriminatory practices, extending the Statute of Limitations from one year to three years for any claim arising after Feb. 15, 2024.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has designated nearly $5 million in state funding toward fair housing testing and vowed to crack down on lawful source of income discrimination, particularly those involving Section 8 vouchers.</p><p>As for its part, NAR has added a requirement that all Realtors must now complete two hours of fair housing training as a part of their triennial Code of Ethics training cycle and NAR is providing courses that can satisfy this requirement.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>New York has gone to great lengths to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. All licensees are now tasked with ensuring all members of the public are treated with equity to ensure that steering and all other forms of discrimination are rooted out and eliminated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Today’s report by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, based on data supplied by OneKey MLS, also indicates inventory levels declined among all property types in all regions.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Across the entire Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors region, demand for all types of housing remains high. Single-family home sales in March continued to decline, with the Bronx experiencing the largest decrease of almost 30%, followed closely by Orange County with a 28.8% drop from this time last year. All other areas experienced double-digit declines in single-family home sales, with the exception of Sullivan County, which saw an 8.3% decrease.</p><p>Sales of condos and co-ops in most of the region also saw sharp drop-offs, with the exception of Rockland County, where condo sales rose by 8.6%.</p><p>On the flip side, March single-family home prices escalated in all areas, with the highest rate in Putnam County—a 19% hike—followed by Orange County with a 13% increase. Pending sales for all property types were down in most of the Hudson Valley, except for a slight uptick in Orange County. The Bronx, however, showed an impressive 30.3% increase in pending sales.</p><p>Today’s report by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, based on data supplied by OneKey MLS, also indicates inventory levels declined among all property types in all regions. March inventory in the Bronx saw the highest falloff with almost 44% fewer single-family homes and 28% fewer co-ops. Orange County’s single-family inventory dropped by almost 40%, and Westchester County, by 31.3%.</p><p>“The Hudson Valley housing market continues to experience strong demand coupled with very low inventory, as interest rates are likely keeping potential sellers and buyers on the fence,” said HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez. “However, pending sales of single-family homes in the Bronx in March and throughout our market area earlier in the year are an indication of increasing future sales in the suburban New York City market.”</p><p>“The spring market is typically a more active time for both sellers and buyers, so we expect to see more sales activity in the coming months,” HGAR President Carmen Bauman added.</p><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>In the Bronx, March single-family home sales plunged by 29.3%, while prices rose 6.8% to a median sales price of $625,000 from 2023. Condo sales declined by 11.1%, with the median condo sales price also declining more than 27% to $247,500. In 2023, the median condo sales price was $340,000. Co-op sales fell 28.6% and the median sales price declined by 2.4%, bringing the new median to $205,000 from $210,000 at this time last year.</p><p>New listings for single-family homes dropped by 31.5%, while new listings for condos decreased by 39%. Co-op new listings also fell by 11%. Overall inventory for all three housing types was down significantly, with condo sales faring the worst with a 45.1% decline. There were almost 44% fewer single-family homes on the market and nearly 22% fewer co-ops.

    <description><![CDATA[The most common entities that run the risk of losing the limited liability protection are small, closely held corporations and LLCs made up of family members or a small number of shareholders and members.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entrepreneurs, real estate investors, real estate brokers, real estate agents and other corporate and LLC entities alike form limited liability companies “LLCs) or corporations for the purpose of shielding themselves, and parent companies, from liability when establishing and operating a business. This article will review the concepts of limited liability and piercing the corporate veil in light of a recent decision issued on March 7, 2024, by the Appellate Division, First Department, in <em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v. Bonderman</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/44fdDRT">https://bit.ly/44fdDRT</a>] as well as previous caselaw.</p><p>The decision highlights some of the key requirements necessary to establish and maintain limited liability protection for individuals, as well as parent companies that own subsidiaries, when establishing an LLC or corporation. Failure to adhere to these requirements may expose shareholders of corporations and members of LLCs to liability, whether they are individuals or other limited liability entities.</p><h3 id="cortlandt-st-recovery-corp-v-bonderman-piercing-the-corporate-veil-and-the-concept-of-alter-ego"><strong><em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v. Bonderman</em>:<br>Piercing the Corporate Veil and the Concept of Alter Ego</strong></h3><p><em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp.</em> involved a lawsuit where multiple defendant corporations (the TPG defendants or controlling companies) and individual shareholders were being sued for liability in connection with business transactions involving other so-called related companies (the controlled companies) under the theory of alter ego. The plaintiffs alleged that the TPG defendants, as well as the individual shareholders of the controlled companies, were the “alter ego” of the controlled companies and argued that they all should be held liable for the obligations, liabilities and acts of the controlled companies.</p><p>The court in <em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp.</em>, citing a Third Department decision [see <em>Sutton 58 Associates, LLC v. Pilevsky</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3vRxhX6">https://bit.ly/3vRxhX6</a>], pointed out that New York does not generally favor piercing the corporate veil or “disregard[ing] of the corporate form.” For the most part, provided individuals and companies adhere to the corporate formalities and follow the legal principles established under existing caselaw, the limited liability protection afforded to individuals and companies will stand. Plaintiffs will have the burden of establishing that a shareholder or member, or parent company shareholder or member, is the “alter ego” of a particular company in order for liability to extend to those shareholders or members, or any underlying corporate or LLC owners.</p><p>In <em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp.</em>, the court held that in order for a plaintiff to be successful with a claim to pierce the corporate veil, the plaintiff must: “[1] show complete domination of the corporation in respect to the transaction attacked [and] [2] that such domination was used to commit a fraud or wrong against the plaintiff.” The court further explained that it is not sufficient for a plaintiff to make “mere conclusory allegations that the corporate structure is a sham…” when attempting to pierce the corporate veil.</p><p>Further, the plaintiff ‘“…must establish that the owners, through their domination, abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form to perpetrate a wrong or injustice against that party’.” Generally, this is a significant burden for a plaintiff to overcome and attempts to pierce the corporate veil are many times rejected by the courts as is evident in this case.</p><p>The court in <em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp.</em> stated that the plaintiffs may not simply make reference to “tangential” or “tenuous” relationships between the defendants and the controlled companies without providing substantive proof that the “domination” as required by law exists. Further, the plaintiff must also establish that such “domination” was used to commit a wrongful act or fraud against the plaintiff.</p><p>The court cited various examples in other decisions where multiple entities were treated “as a single entity” and where the “lines of corporate control and responsibility” were “blurred.” The court also referenced cases where there was a “…high degree of intermingling among various entities all controlled either directly or indirectly by family members.” In the instant case, the court pointed out that the plaintiffs failed to provide proof to establish either of two aforementioned prongs.</p><h3 id="important-factors-a-court-considers-when-deciding-to-pierce-the-corporate-veil"><strong>Important Factors a Court Considers When Deciding to Pierce the Corporate Veil</strong></h3><p>The court in <em>Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp.</em>, citing another First Department decision [see <em>Tap Holdings, LLC v. Orix Financial Corp.</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3UiT03u">https://bit.ly/3UiT03u</a>], explained that when establishing “domination” courts consider, among others, the following factors:</p><ol>
<li>Disregard of corporate formalities;</li>
<li>Inadequate capitalization;</li>
<li>Intermingling of funds;</li>
<li>Overlap in ownership;</li>
<li>Officers, directors, and personnel;</li>
<li>Common office space or telephone numbers;</li>
<li>The degree of discretion demonstrated by the alleged dominated corporation;</li>
<li>Whether the corporations are treated as independent profit centers; and</li>
<li>The payment or guarantee of the corporation's debts by the dominating entity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately the court dismissed the claims because the plaintiffs did not offer proof that the controlling company owned stock or was involved in the offering memorandum or corporate recapitalization, or that the controlling company disregarded corporate formalities, intermingled funds with the controlled company, had common officers, directors or staff; shared office space or telephone numbers; or interfered with the controlled company’s business decision-making process.</p><p>The court also dismissed the claims brought against the individual shareholders because the plaintiffs offered “…no evidence that they were ‘actually doing business in their individual capacities, shuttling their personal funds in and out of the corporations without regard to formality and to suit their immediate convenience.’”</p><h3 id="prior-caselaw-the-doctrine-of-piercing-the-corporate-veil"><strong>Prior Caselaw: the Doctrine of Piercing the Corporate Veil</strong></h3><p>In <em>Walkovszky v. Carlton</em>, a 1966 decision issued by the Appellate Division, Second Department [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3W02AKa">https://bit.ly/3W02AKa</a>], the court explained that “[t]he law permits the incorporation of a business for the very purpose of enabling its proprietors to escape personal liability but, manifestly, the privilege is not without its limits. Broadly speaking, the courts will disregard the corporate form, or, to use accepted terminology, ‘pierce the corporate veil,’ whenever necessary ‘to prevent fraud or to achieve equity’.”</p><p>The court in <em>Walkovszky</em>, citing the renowned Justice Cardozo, goes on to further explain that “[i]n determining whether liability should be extended to reach assets beyond those belonging to the corporation, we are guided…by ‘general rules of agency’. In other words, whenever anyone uses control of the corporation to further his own rather than the corporation's business, he will be liable for the corporation's acts ‘upon the principle of <em>respondeat superior</em> applicable even where the agent is a natural person.’” Basically, if someone uses the corporation as an alternate ego for personal rather than business purposes, then said person will be liable for the acts of the corporation.</p><p>In <em>Austin Powder Company v. McCullough</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4aRiXwG">https://bit.ly/4aRiXwG</a>], that court further held that “[w]hen a corporation has been so dominated by an individual or another corporation and its separate entity so ignored that it primarily transacts the dominator's business instead of its own and can be called the other's alter ego, the corporate form may be disregarded to achieve an equitable result.” Once the corporate veil is pierced, as the court in <em>Walkovszky</em> held, liability will extend to the individual, or to any other member or shareholder of the company and would include the corporation’s or LLC’s commercial dealings as well their negligent acts.</p><h3 id="the-importance-of-following-the-corporate-formalities"><strong>The Importance of Following the Corporate Formalities</strong></h3><p>As discussed, corporations and LLCs are distinct from the individual shareholders who (or the separate parent entities that) form them. Among others, the main advantage is that the shareholders or members of a corporation or LLC are not held responsible for the debts, obligations, liabilities or even the negligence of the company.</p><p>Unfortunately, many fail to adhere to the legal requirements necessary to protect against losing the invaluable protection afforded to these entities. The most common entities that run the risk of losing the limited liability protection are small, closely held corporations and LLCs made up of family members or a small number of shareholders and members. However, it is also not uncommon for large corporations and LLCs to fail to follow the requisite parameters established under the law.</p><p>As highlighted by the court decisions above, individuals and entities risk losing the limited liability protection if the company, or the individual shareholders or members, engage in fraudulent activities, or do not follow the corporate formalities (e.g., establishing and following Bylaws for corporate entities, preparing operating agreements for LLCs, maintaining minutes, holding member or shareholder meetings, preparing resolutions for major corporate or LLC actions, etc.).</p><p>Even when there is only one shareholder or member (or a small few), meeting minutes must be maintained, and resolutions prepared. The corporate veil can also be pierced if the assets and funds of the corporation or LLC are commingled, and personal expenses are paid directly from the business accounts or if there is no real separation between the shareholders or members and the business itself. The corporate formalities must be adhered to because the courts will not think twice about piercing the corporate veil. &nbsp;</p><p>One important thing professionals and real estate licensees, who are fiduciaries under the law, must be aware of is that the limited liability protection does not extend to that individual where there is a breach of fiduciary duty owed to a client. However, it would cover them for the obligations and liabilities of the corporate or LLC entity.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to understand all of the requirements before forming a corporation or LLC and also consult with legal and accounting professionals before setting any limited liability entity. There are many tax and legal nuances that need to be considered before any of these entities are formed.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

Year-over-year, sales waned 3.7% (down from 4.35 million in March 2023).</p><p>“Though rebounding from cyclical lows, home sales are stuck because interest rates have not made any major moves,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “There are nearly six million more jobs now compared to pre-COVID highs, which suggests more aspiring home buyers exist in the market.”</p><p>Total housing inventor registered at the end of March was 1.11 million units, up 4.7% from February and 14.4% from one year ago (970,000). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.2-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.9 months in February and 2.7 months in March 2023.</p><p>“More inventory is always welcomed in the current environment,” Yun added. “Frankly, it's a great time to list with ongoing multiple offers on mid-priced properties and, overall, home prices continuing to rise.”</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in March was $393,500, an increase of 4.8% from the previous year ($375,300). All four U.S. regions registered price gains.</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index"><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 33 days in March, down from 38 days in February but up from 29 days in March 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 32% of sales in March, up from 26% in February and 28% in March 2023. NAR's 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in March, down from 33% in February but up from 27% one year ago.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 15% of homes in March, down from 21% in February and 17% in March 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in March, virtually unchanged from last month and the prior year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates"><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.88% as of April 11.

The median price in the Northeast was $434,600, up 9.9% from one year ago.</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales retracted 1.9% from one month ago to an annual rate of 1.01 million in March, down 1.0% from the prior year. The median price in the Midwest was $292,400, up 7.5% from March 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South faded 5.9% from February to an annual rate of 1.9 million in March, down 5.0% from one year before.

    <description><![CDATA[The budget includes a host of measures to enhance housing development and tenant protections in New York City, including the new 485-x tax incentive.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—After negotiations that caused the Fiscal Year 2025 New York State Budget to be 20 days late, Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers announced on April 20 the passage and enactment of the budget that includes a host of housing policy changes and reforms. Some of these measures were praised by real estate and housing officials, while others drew the ire of industry professionals and tenant advocates.</p><p>The governor pressed lawmakers for agreement on provisions that would facilitate the construction of new housing stock to address the shortage of supply. In addition, the budget includes facets of “Good Cause Eviction” that were opposed by many real estate and landlord groups, including the New York State Association of Realtors, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and many others. Some of the compromises reached on Good Cause eviction in the budget were also criticized by some tenant advocacy organizations.</p><p>After the budget deal was reached, the governor and legislative leaders focused on the housing policy agreements and not on the protracted negotiations.</p><p>“Since I became governor, I've held a vision to build housing that New Yorkers desperately need, and we're celebrating this historic agreement that will transform lives and put working families first,” Gov. Hochul said. “This housing deal enacts a plan endorsed by unions and a diverse and vibrant coalition of New Yorkers to revolutionize the housing landscape and create the biggest expansion of tenant rights in New York in generations.”</p><p>New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said, “The Senate Democratic Majority and our colleagues in state government entered this budget knowing it was beyond time to secure a housing deal that directly addresses the challenges families face. We understood that this would not be an easy task; however, this historic package meets the need to develop new, affordable housing, helps safeguard homeowners from foreclosures and squatting situations, and empowers tenants with strong protections like those outlined in the principles of Good Cause. It's exciting to join my fellow public servants, advocates and Labor in celebrating this milestone, but we are aware that significant work remains.”</p><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, “The Assembly Majority has a long history of fighting to make safe, affordable housing accessible for New Yorkers. The provisions we pass in this budget will provide critical protections for renters and homeowners, create new housing stock and invest in affordable housing across the state with programs like the New York Housing for the Future. This new program will create affordable housing for those looking to rent as well as to become homeowners, and together with the investments made in programs like NYCHA and Mitchell Lama will help more families find safe, affordable housing.”</p><p>The budget includes a host of measures to enhance housing development and tenant protections in New York City, including the new 485-x tax incentive, a 10-year program building on the now-expired 421-a incentive program, which provides benefits for housing construction while encouraging affordability and delivering strengthened wage standards for building service and construction workers, where applicable. According to estimates, the 421-a program produced more than two-thirds of all newly constructed multifamily housing in the city in the last decade.</p><p>The budget also extends the construction deadline for projects currently vested in the expired 421-a program through 2031, ensuring thousands of previously at-risk rental units, including affordable housing, can be built. In addition, the budget establishes a new tax incentive for commercial conversion projects that include affordable housing, grants the authority to lift state restrictions on residential density in New York City for the first time since the 1960s while requiring affordability, and authorizes the city to create a pilot program to provide amnesty to existing basement and cellar apartments.</p><p>For localities outside of New York City, the budget includes an opt-in tax incentive program for mixed-income and 100% affordable new construction or conversion multifamily rental projects, and an incentive to create accessory dwelling units (ADUs). The budget also requires the State’s Fire Prevention and Building Code Council to study ways to amend the code to facilitate alternative forms of multi-family housing.</p><p>Gov. Hochul has also secured funding for a $500 million capital fund to develop up to 15,000 units of housing on state sites across New York. The Governor announced the Redevelopment of Underutilized Sites for Housing initiative in her 2024 State of the State after signing an executive order last year requiring all state agencies to examine properties within their control to determine their housing potential. Sites will become available on an individual basis as the state issues requests for proposals to develop them.</p><p>In addition, Gov. Hochul has reached an agreement to strengthen New York’s Pro-Housing Communities program by enabling the State to make the Pro-Housing Communities certification a requirement to receive up to $650 million in state discretionary funding. The Governor announced the Pro-Housing Communities Program last year as part of a package of Executive Actions to increase New York’s housing supply to recognize and reward municipalities actively working to unlock their housing potential and encourage others to follow suit. To date, 179 localities have launched applications to become Pro-Housing Communities and 49 communities have been certified.</p><p>The FY 2025 Enacted Budget will further take action to help bring vacant apartments back on the rental market by raising the cap on individual apartment improvements for rent-stabilized units. New requirements to the system will allow owners to recoup a reasonable portion of renovation costs over a 15-year period, which will help maintain the supply of safe, modernized rent-stabilized units. The Budget also provides $40 million in capital to assist in bringing back online vacant apartments in need of repair outside of New York City.</p><h3 id="tenant-and-homeowner-protections"><strong>Tenant and Homeowner Protections</strong></h3><p>The budget makes annual rent increases above 10 percent or 5% plus the Consumer Price Index (whichever is lower) presumptively unreasonable to protect tenants against price gouging and strengthens legal protections for covered renters in eviction proceedings, where applicable. These protections will be mandatory in New York City; municipalities outside of New York City will have the ability to opt-in to the program. Separately, Gov. Hochul reached an agreement to reinforce existing law to make clear that squatters are not tenants, and thus are not entitled to these and other tenant protections.</p><p>Other key housing policy changes include strengthened protections for homeowners against deed theft by creating a clear definition of the crime of deed theft in the larceny statute and by limiting the ability of predatory investors to acquire interests in inherited property and to pressure homeowners into selling their family homes. To further prevent loss, the governor has introduced a Transfer on Death Deed, which will enable homeowners to be certain their home will be protected after their passing, without the necessity of drafting a formal will.</p><h3 id="fighting-bias-and-housing-discrimination"><strong>Fighting Bias and Housing Discrimination</strong></h3><p>As part of the FY 2025 Enacted Budget, the governor advanced legislation to prohibit insurance carriers from inquiring about or considering tenants' source of income, the existence of affordable dwelling units, or the receipt of governmental housing assistance in the decision to issue or continue to provide insurance for residential real property. The new legislation will help ensure affordable housing providers have access to reasonably-priced insurance, which in turn will help avoid rent increases for tenants.</p><p>The state will also establish a new enforcement unit dedicated to swift resolution of complaints about housing discrimination related to Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, helping to place impacted individuals and families in available housing to which they had been impermissibly denied access based on their vouchers.</p><h3 id="additional-capital-investments"><strong>Additional Capital Investments</strong></h3><p>The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also includes more than $600 million in capital funding to support housing statewide, including:</p><ul>
<li>$150 million for New York Housing for the Future to subsidize construction of cooperative rental and cooperative homeownership 100% affordable housing.</li>
<li>$140 million for capital improvements of New York City Housing Authority developments.</li>
<li>$80 million for capital improvements for Mitchell-Lamas.</li>
<li>$75 million for capital improvements of public housing authorities outside of New York City.</li>
<li>$50 million for Land Banks to redevelop blighted or abandoned properties.</li>
<li>$40 million for capital awards to upgrade vacant rental units outside of New York City.</li>
<li>$40 million for Infill Housing to fund development of small homes within unused and underutilized lands with existing development patterns.</li>
<li>$10 million for capital improvements of rural housing subsidized by the Federal USDA 515 program.</li>
<li>$25.5 million in other one-time capital assistance projects.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[In the weeks leading up to heavy negotiations in Albany, HGAR personally educated more than two dozen elected officials on Good Cause Eviction and the most problematic aspects of valuing tenant protection over property rights.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York State experienced two seismic shifts in the last few weeks! One was the earthquake on April 5th that got at least some New Yorkers talking, and the other was that Good Cause Eviction has passed in New York State.&nbsp; Much like the April 5th earthquake, not everyone felt it or were even aware it happened, but unlike April 5th, time will tell how this version of Good Cause Eviction shakes out to affect the housing landscape.</p><p>Before we unpack what was passed, I wanted to acknowledge the advocacy efforts and hours of negotiations that HGAR, NYSAR and other like-minded organizations participated in these last few weeks. There were many instances where Calls to Action and hurried messages to legislators were called upon. To that point, HGAR was able to advocate extensively at the 2024 Lobby Day. In the weeks leading up to heavy negotiations in Albany, HGAR personally educated more than two dozen elected officials on Good Cause Eviction and the most problematic aspects of valuing tenant protection over property rights.</p><p>Alas, a version of Good Cause Eviction did pass so let’s look at what the law of the land currently states.</p><p>The recent legislative change mandates landlords to extend lease renewal offers to tenants who consistently fulfill their rental obligations and abide by the terms stipulated in their previous lease agreements. Additionally, it empowers renters to contest rent hikes exceeding 10%, or 5% plus the consumer price index, whichever is lower. This enactment comes into force immediately.</p><p>However, certain exemptions are included in the legislation, notably a provision allowing owners with 10 or fewer units spread across multiple properties to be exempted from the regulation, albeit with some ambiguity. Moreover, buildings constructed since the beginning of 2009 are granted a 30-year exemption.</p><p>Tenants residing in buildings comprising 10 units or fewer where the owner resides on-site will not meet the eligibility criteria.</p><p>According to the law, tenants are eligible for protection against unjustified eviction if the landlord's entire property portfolio comprises more than 10 apartments. For instance, if a landlord possesses two six-unit buildings, the good-cause protection applies due to the combined total of 12 units in their portfolio. However, many apartment buildings are owned by individual limited liability companies (LLCs), obscuring the identities of the actual owners. LLCs linked to the same individual or entity may list separate managing officers, complicating the verification of ownership further.</p><p>Certain types of properties such as co-ops, condos, mobile homes, dormitories, hotels, and apartments governed by other rent regulations are excluded from the scope of the new law, as are seasonal residences.</p><p>Landlords retain the right to decline lease renewals or initiate evictions for various reasons, even if the unit falls under the purview of the good-cause law. In cases where tenants cease rent payments, engage in unlawful activities, or breach substantial tenancy obligations without rectifying them within 10 days of receiving written notice, eviction remains a possibility. Additionally, landlords can evict tenants if they intend to transfer the unit to a family member or demolish the building.</p><p>These rules do not automatically apply outside New York City. Under the new law, other towns and municipalities will have to enact their own laws to opt in to good-cause rules.</p><p>There is some possibly good news coming out of this. The good news seems to be that neither “side” is happy with what has been passed. Meaning, the property rights advocates say that this has gone too far but the tenant advocates feel it did not go far enough.&nbsp; This might not seem like much, but the art of the compromise in Albany might have saved property rights advocates a lot of pain. Not long ago the Housing Stability &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019 passed where tenants’ rights advocates were touting much more of a victory, not so much with the passing of Good Cause Eviction.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, politically, Good Cause Eviction is done. The legislature gets to go into the reelection season telling their constituents that they passed historic tenant protections while telling other constituents that things could have been worse for property owners if they did not hold the line, depending on the crowd at any given time.</p><p>The NYS housing political landscape has changed both in theory and processes. Process, in the sense that Good Cause Eviction will be worked out in real-time as the law is put into practice. In theory in the sense that for the better part of the last five years, Good Cause Eviction has been THE housing conversation in New York State politics. For several reasons, no other housing topic could be addressed before the topic of tenant protection was addressed. Now that the Good Cause Eviction will not be the silver bullet that tackles the housing crisis, it is time to realize an opportunity that the housing conversation has been liberated from the elephant in the room. Now topics like zoning reform, co-op transparency, housing vouchers and more might get the political daylight they previously did not. Time will tell how this all breaks down in the days and weeks to come but for now, it’s a new day for New York.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—increased to 78.2 in March.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in March climbed 3.4%, the National Association of Realtors reported on April 25. The Northeast, South and West posted monthly gains in transactions while the Midwest recorded a loss. Year-over-year, the Northeast and South registered decreases but the Midwest and West improved.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—increased to 78.2 in March. Year-over-year, pending transactions were up 0.1%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“March’s Pending Home Sales Index—at 78.2—marks the best performance in a year, but it still remains in a fairly narrow range over the last 12 months without a measurable breakout,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Meaningful gains will only occur with declining mortgage rates and rising inventory.”</p><h3 id="quarterly-us-economic-forecast"><strong>Quarterly U.S. Economic Forecast</strong></h3><p>NAR forecasts that existing-home sales will rise by 9% in 2024 to 4.46 million (from 4.09 million in 2023) and another 13.2% in 2025 to 5.05 million (from 2024). Housing starts are expected to rise by 1.2% in 2024 to 1.43 million (from 1.413 million in 2023) and 4.9% to 1.5 million in 2025 (from 2024).</p><p>“Home sales have lingered at 30-year lows, and since 70 million more Americans live in the country now compared to three decades ago, it’s inevitable that sales will rise in coming years,” explained Yun. “Inventory will grow steadily from more home construction, and various life-changing events will require people to trade up, trade down or move to another location.”</p><p>NAR expects that median home prices will increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record of $396,800 (from $389,800 in 2023) and another 1.8% in 2025 to $403,800 (from 2024). NAR forecasts a modest reduction—0.6%—in the median new home price to $426,100 in 2024 (from $428,600 in 2023), reflecting the building of smaller-sized homes. The association anticipates the median new home price will jump 3.4% to $440,500 in 2025 (from 2024).</p><p>“Home prices are expected to rise roughly in line with consumer price inflation and wage growth over the next two years,” added Yun. “Most homeowners are on strong financial footing in current market conditions, with only 2% of sales classified as being distressed.”</p><p>NAR expects home sales to steadily improve while home prices continue to hit record highs.</p><p>“Job gains, steady mortgage rates and the release of inventory from pent-up home sellers will lead to more sales,” explained Yun. “Given the lingering housing shortage, home prices will march higher, albeit much more slowly than in the past.”</p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown"><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The Northeast PHSI increased 2.7% from last month to 65.1, a decline of 0.3% from March 2023. The Midwest index fell 4.3% to 78.1 in March, up 1.3% from one year ago.</p><p>The South PHSI improved 7.0% to 95.8 in March, dropping 1.5% from the prior year. The West index rose 6.8% in March to 61.0, up 3.6% from March 2023.</p><p>&nbsp;“Home prices rising faster than income growth is not healthy and adds challenges for first-time buyers,” said Yun.</p><p>Yun further noted, “Inventory will gradually rise from recent growth in home building. Additionally, many sellers who delayed listing in the past two years will start putting their homes on the market to move to a different home that better fits their new life circumstances—such as changes in family composition, jobs, commuting patterns and retirees wanting to be closer to their grandkids.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/04/NAR-March-2024-PHS-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/NAR-March-2024-PHS-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/04/NAR-March-2024-PHS-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[While interchange improvements and possible multimodal upgrades are planned in the corridor, the main focus of construction would be centered at locations on Route 17 in Orange County.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TOWN OF WALLKILL—In advance of public scoping open houses scheduled on May 15 in the Town of Wallkill, NY and May 16 in Central Valley, NY for the “State Route 17 Mobility &amp; Access Improvement Project” also known as the Route 17 expansion project, the New York State Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration have provided significant detail on their three preliminary study concepts involving improvements or expansions possible for the roadway in Orange and Sullivan counties.</p><p>On April 30, the Federal Highway Administration, in conjunction with NYSDOT, published in the Federal Register its Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the project. The publication of the NOI began a 30-day public comment period that includes the May 15 and May 16 scoping sessions. The FHWA and NYSDOT are co-lead agencies for the project. Although the EIS will include a No Build option, it is doubtful based on the longstanding need for improvements and the fact that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has committed $1 billion in capital funding for the Route 17 improvement/expansion project that the No Build option will be selected.</p><p>In the NOI, FHWA and NYSDOT spelled out preliminary details of their three build concepts currently being reviewed involving 1) operational improvements; 2) the addition of a peak period shoulder lane and 3) the addition of a general use third lane. NYSDOT expects to complete a Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project in 2025 and issue a Record of Decision and secure all permits and approvals by May 2026.</p><p>The project involves improvements to a 30-mile stretch of New York State Route 17 between Exit 113 in Wurtsboro, Sullivan County, and Interstate 87 in Orange County (Woodbury). The project will address operational and safety deficiencies, improve congestion-related travel times and address features of the corridor that currently do not meet Interstate standards. Multi-modal improvements will be assessed and considered, as well as environmental impacts. The NOI also included anticipated project timelines prior to construction.</p><p>Based on the NOI, while interchange improvements and possible multimodal upgrades are planned in the corridor that includes sections of Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties, the main focus of construction would be centered at locations on Route 17 in Orange County in each of the three preliminary concepts currently being studied.</p><h3 id="concept-no-1-operational-improvements"><strong>Concept No. 1 Operational Improvements</strong></h3><p>Concept 1 “proposes the construction of operational improvements, such as auxiliary lanes and collector-distributor roads, at three locations along NYS Route 17. NYS Route 17 would remain as two mainline travel lanes in each direction. Mainline operational improvements would be constructed along NYS Route 17 in both directions from Exit 120, NYS Route 211 to Exit 122, Crystal Run Road, from Exit 122 A, Fletcher Street to Exit 124, NYS Route 207, and from Exit 130, NYS Route 208 to Exit 130A, U.S. Route 6 at the eastern end of the project in order to adequately address operational and safety needs related to the close proximity of the interchanges and the volume of entering and exiting traffic at these three locations.”</p><p>Interchange improvements would be included along the transportation corridor to address non-standard, non-conforming and operational issues. The NOI also states that multimodal improvements would also be assessed as part of Concept 1.</p><h3 id="concept-no-2-peak-period-shoulder-lane"><strong>Concept No. 2 Peak Period Shoulder Lane</strong></h3><p>Concept No. 2 “proposes the construction of a peak period shoulder lane in both directions of NYS Route 17 from Exit 122, Crystal Run Road to Exit 130, NYS Route 208. Peak period shoulder lanes would provide additional mobility during periods of high traffic volume. A full-time general use lane would be added along NYS Route 17 in both directions from Exit 120, NYS Route 211 to Exit 122, Crystal Run Road and from Exit 130, NYS Route 208 to I-87 at the eastern end of the project in order to adequately address operational and safety needs related to the close proximity of the interchanges and the volume of entering and exiting traffic at these three locations.”</p><p>Concept No. 2 would also include interchange improvements in the corridor and the review of multimodal upgrades.</p><h3 id="concept-no-3-continuous-general-use-travel-lane"><strong>Concept No. 3 Continuous General Use Travel Lane</strong></h3><p>Concept No. 3 “proposes construction of a continuous third general use travel lane along NYS Route 17 in each direction between Exit 120, NYS Route 211 in Wallkill to the eastern limit of the project at I-87 in Woodbury.”</p><p>Concept No. 3 would also include interchange improvements in the corridor and the review of multimodal upgrades.</p><p>The NOI also included potential environmental, traffic and construction impacts, as well as anticipated permits and authorizations.</p><h3 id="project-timeline"><strong>Project Timeline</strong></h3><p>The FHWA and NYSDOT spelled out an anticipated project timeline going forward.</p><ul>
<li>Public Scoping Meeting (May 2024)</li>
<li>Project Scoping Report Publication (August 2024)</li>
<li>Notice of the Availability of the Draft DEIS-Draft Environmental Impact Statement (August 2025)</li>
<li>Public Hearing (September 2025)</li>
<li>45-Day DEIS Public Comment Period (Begins with the Notice of Availability of DEIS (August-October 2025)</li>
<li>Submit Final EIS (Final Environmental Impact Statement) to FHWA (December 2025)</li>
<li>Publish Single FEIS and ROD (Record of Decision) February 2026</li>
<li>Issue all Project Permits and Authorization Decisions (May 2026).</li>
</ul>
<p>One major improvement project to be undertaken during the study period is Stage II of the Exit 122 Crystal Run Road interchange improvement project that has been estimated to cost somewhere between $75 million to $85 million. That project is expected to go out to bid in the fall of this year with work on the project to begin shortly thereafter and interchange upgrades completed in 2015.</p><p>It should also be noted that NYSDOT completed work at Exit 131 in 2021 that involved major interchange improvements and enhanced access to Woodbury Common that totaled approximately $125 million.</p><p>The informal, open-house-style scoping session gatherings will take place on Wednesday, May 15 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Town of Wallkill Community Center located at 7-9 Wes Warren Drive, Scotchtown, and Thursday, May 16 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Central Valley Elementary School located at 45 State Route 32, Central Valley. Meeting content will be the same at each event. NYSDOT representatives will be available to provide information, answer questions and gather input.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[In 2022, the median net worth of homeowners was $396,200, while the median net worth of renters was $10,400.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun forecasts that interest rates will fall in the long term, 2024 existing-home sales will rise to 4.46 million (up 9% from 4.09 million in 2023) and 2025 existing-home sales will increase to 5.05 million (up 13.2% from 2024)—with further gains in eight of the next 10 years.</p><p>Yun in a presentation on May 7<sup>th</sup> during the “Residential Economic Issues &amp; Trends Forum” at NAR’s 2024 Realtors Legislative Meetings, also explained that rents will calm down further, which will hold down the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and prompt the Federal Reserve cut interest rates.</p><p>Yun said that based on April’s employment data, there are six million more jobs compared to the pre-Covid highs, and jobs are boosting home prices.</p><p>“More jobs mean more home sales and higher housing demand,” said Yun. “You need a strong local economy for a strong housing market.”</p><p>Yun discussed the wealth comparison between homeowners and renters. In 2022, the median net worth of homeowners was $396,200, while the median net worth of renters was $10,400.</p><p>“The referral business is key,” Yun told a crowd of Realtors. “Your past clients are super happy in terms of their wealth gains. Seven percent mortgage rates are high compared to a couple of years ago, but you have to buy a home in order to build wealth. Have Americans lost the dream of homeownership? I don’t think so.”</p><p>Yun made several comparisons to 1995. The U.S. currently has 40 million more total payroll jobs and 70 million more people than in 1995. However, annual existing-home sales in 2023 experienced their worst year since 1995. So far in 2024, monthly existing-home sales rates have struggled to climb above last year’s level.</p><p>&nbsp;“How is it that home sales can be this low when we’ve got so many people living in this country?” asked Yun. “High mortgage rates and lack of inventory were a shock. Over the next 10 years, probably eight of those 10 years will improve for home sales.”</p><p>Yun touched on housing inventory saying, “Not all housing demand is being satisfied, due to lack of supply. We are looking at advocacy policies to counteract that.”</p><p>“Mortgage rates are very important,” explained Yun. “The Federal Reserve has delayed rate cuts. I would have thought that, by now, rates would be lower and rate cuts would have begun. Whatever rate cut the Federal Reserve does not do this year will simply get pushed back to 2025. They’re calling for a September rate cut, but we’ll see.”</p><p>Yun discussed how the 30-year mortgage and federal funds rate are in a high-rate environment. He explained that the monthly payment for first-time home buyers—with a 10% down payment and 80% of median home price—has gone up significantly during Covid, doubling the cost.</p><p>Yun noted that homeowners are happy. According to NAR data (2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers), nine out of 10 buyers (89%) relied on the services of a real estate agent or broker. Of those, there is a 90% satisfaction rate—they would use their agent again or recommend their agent to others.</p><p>Yun questioned whether the immense size of the government deficit is further pressuring rising rates. He addressed government spending: “Four years out from the start of the pandemic, the U.S. is spending money as if we’re still in the heights of COVID-19.”</p><p>“We had a massive budget deficit while experiencing a good economy, meaning low unemployment,” said Yun. “People may get used to permanently high inflation, and people will be looking for an inflation hedge. Real estate is proven.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price climbed 5% to $389,400. In the prior quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 3.4%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—More than 90% of metro markets (205 out of 221, or 93%) posted home price gains in the first quarter of 2024, as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.60% to 6.94%, according to the National Association of Realtors’ latest quarterly report released today (May 8). Thirty percent of the 221 tracked metro areas experienced double-digit price gains over the same period, up from 15% in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year median price increases, which can be influenced by the types of homes sold during the quarter, all registered gains of at least 18.2%. Six of the markets were in Illinois and Wisconsin. Overall, those markets were Fond du Lac, WI (23.7%); Kankakee, IL (22.0%); Rockford, IL (20.1%); Champaign-Urbana, IL (20.0%); Johnson City, TN (19.3%); Racine, WI (19.0%); Newark, NJ-PA (18.8%); Bloomington, IL (18.5%); New York-Jersey City-White Plains, NY-NJ (18.4%); and Cumberland, MD-WVA (18.2%).</p><p>“Astonishingly, greater than 90% of the country’s metro areas experienced home price growth despite facing the highest mortgage rates in two decades,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “In the current market, rising prices are the direct result of insufficient housing supply not meeting the full demand.”</p><p>Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price climbed 5% to $389,400. In the prior quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 3.4%.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South registered the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (46%) in the first quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 3.3%. Prices also swelled 11% in the Northeast, 7.4% in the Midwest and 7.3% in the West.[1]</p><p>Eight of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Overall, those markets were San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($1,840,000; 13.7%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,365,000; 14.2%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,300,000; 14%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,085,800; 5.5%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($981,000; 11.5%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($909,300; 7%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($908,700; 7.6%); Salinas, CA ($899,200; 4.1%); Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL ($850,000; 9.4%); and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($823,000; 10.2%).</p><p>“The expensive markets in the West, where home prices declined last year, are roaring back,” Yun said. “Price dips in that region were viewed as second-chance opportunities by many buyers.”</p><p>Seven percent of markets (15 of 221) experienced home price declines in the first quarter, down from 14% in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p>Housing affordability improved in the first quarter as mortgage rates declined. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,037, down 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2023 ($2,161) but up 9.33%—or $173—from one year ago. Families typically spent 24.2% of their income on mortgage payments, down from 26.1% in the prior quarter but up from 23.3% one year ago.</p><p>Once again, first-time buyers faced limited inventory and elevated home prices in the first quarter, though affordability conditions bettered from the previous quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $331,000 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment fell slightly to $1,998, down 5.7% from the previous quarter ($2,118). However, that was an increase of $168, or 9.2%, from one year ago ($1,830). First-time buyers typically spent 36.5% of their family income on mortgage payments, down from 39.3% in the prior quarter.</p><p>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down payment mortgage in 40.7% of markets, down from 47.1% in the previous quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 4.5% of markets, up from 2.3% in the prior quarter.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/Infographic-NAR-Q1-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Infographic-NAR-Q1-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Infographic-NAR-Q1-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/Infographic-NAR-Q1-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">SOURCE: NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS</em></i></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New York City and the Hudson Valley continue to be among the most desirable locations in the nation, so it’s no surprise that inventory is at a premium and home prices are reflecting that.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Home prices in the New York metropolitan area, including New York City, Westchester County and Jersey City, NJ saw significant growth in the first quarter of 2024 as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.60% to 6.94%, according to the National Association of Realtors<sup> </sup>latest quarterly report. Compared to one year ago, the median price for all residential property types in the New York metro area climbed by 18.4% to $663,100.</p><p>The New York metro area ranked within the top 10 in the country for price gains. “New York City and the Hudson Valley continue to be among the most desirable locations in the nation, so it’s no surprise that inventory is at a premium and home prices are reflecting that,” said Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO. “Based on pending sales in our region, we’re looking forward to an exciting spring and summer market, where we’re predicting that the market will open up a bit more offering additional properties for sale.”</p><p>HGAR’s coverage areas within the New York Metro region include the Bronx and Westchester, where pending sales for single-family, condos and co-ops were up in both locations at the end of the first quarter. In the Bronx, pending sales saw a 13.8% increase for all property types, but the median sales price decreased slightly by 11.8% to $317,500. Closed sales were down by 22%, and new listings by 16.9%. Based on overall prices, the housing affordability index for the Bronx was up by 8.2%. At the end of the first quarter, the Bronx had a 5.9-month supply of housing, a decrease of 23.4% from the same period in 2023.</p><p>Westchester County experienced a 12.9% hike in sales prices for all three property types, bringing the overall median price to $630,000. Closed sales decreased by 9.6%, followed by new listings at a 4.3% decline. Pending sales were up 17.2%. Because home sale prices remain high in the county, Westchester’s affordability index was down by 15.7%. As of the end of the first quarter, Westchester had a 2.3-month supply of homes, which was down 20.7% from last year.</p><p>Nationally, more than 90% of metro markets (205 out of 221, or 93%) posted home price gains in the first quarter of 2024. Thirty percent of the tracked metro areas (63 of 221) experienced double-digit price increases over the same period, up from 15% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Seven percent of markets (15 of 221) experienced home price declines in the first quarter, down from 14% in the previous quarter. The national median single-family existing-home price climbed 5% from one year ago to $389,400.</p><p>“Astonishingly, greater than 90% of the country’s metro areas experienced home price growth despite facing the highest mortgage rates in two decades,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “In the current market, rising prices are the direct result of insufficient housing supply not meeting the full demand.”</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, home prices swelled year-over-year 11% in the Northeast, 7.4% in the Midwest, 7.3% in the West, and 3.3% the South.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[With the median sales price for a single-family home in the City of Mount Vernon at $627,550 as of April, a 1.5% transfer tax translates to $9,413.25.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors is taking a stand against the City of Mount Vernon’s new law, which will increase the real estate transfer tax on sold properties from 1% to 1.5% when implemented later this year. The new tax will be imposed on the sale of properties in excess of $50,000, formerly $100,000.</p><p>With the median sales price for a single-family home in the City of Mount Vernon at $627,550 as of April, a 1.5% transfer tax translates to $9,413.25. This amount could be passed onto home buyers, should the seller decide not to cover that cost, or it may be added to the price of the home.&nbsp;</p><p>“This legislation authorizes the City of Mount Vernon to increase the transfer tax without a voter referendum,” said Rey Hollingsworth, Secretary of the HGAR Board of Directors and Broker/Owner of Hollingsworth Real Estate Group in White Plains. “Other transfer tax proposals, particularly those tied to community preservation funds, at least give the locality’s residents the opportunity to vote in favor of or against the tax.”</p><p>HGAR, along with many New York Realtors, generally oppose real estate transfer taxes at all levels of government. “These taxes make home-buying less affordable, thus taking away from working families and individuals the many benefits of homeownership,” added Hollingsworth. “This would also exacerbate the dreams of African American buyers, who comprise approximately 80% of buyers in Mount Vernon.”</p><p>The current homeownership rate for African Americans in New York State is 34%, which is lower than the 44% homeownership rate for African Americans in 1968 when the Fair Housing Act was passed. “This community is in a housing crisis. Mount Vernon’s transfer tax increase adds to the crisis, instead of working to resolve it,” he said.</p><p>Hollingsworth contends that transfer taxes also make cities less competitive with other cities by raising the cost of buying real estate for both residential and commercial properties. “Local governments should be considering legislation that promotes tax equity, homeownership, and economic development, rather than further aggravating the problem by imposing even more taxes,” he added.</p><p>According to the Federal Reserve’s most recent survey of consumer finances, the median savings account balance for all American families was $8,000 in 2022. Using an example of a $500,000 Mount Vernon home, a down payment of just 10% would equal $50,000, plus an additional $7,500 to cover the transfer tax. This amount is in addition to buyer closing costs, which typically range from 3% to 6% of the loan, according to Rocket Mortgage. For this example, a loan of $450,000 could carry closing costs of $13,500 to $27,000.</p><p>As a result of what HGAR considers to be prohibitive costs for potential local buyers, the association is urging Mount Vernon’s City Council to repeal Local Law 4, passed at the end of 2023. Hollingsworth plans to address the City Council at a meeting later this month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[At the recent May 1, 2024, HGAR Board of Directors meeting, the Board voted on two association matters relating to the filing of arbitrations and administration of ethics complaints.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As seems to be the case, we are always being barraged by tons of information from various sources. Some are reliable. Others, not so much. Still, others are downright conspiratory and false. In an effort to help create a reference point for recent questions/developments and all things Realtor-related, I’m making this month’s article a “cheat sheet” of recent developments.</p><h3 id="local-hgar"><strong>Local (HGAR)</strong></h3><p>At the recent May 1, 2024, HGAR Board of Directors meeting, the Board voted on two association matters relating to the filing of arbitrations and administration of ethics complaints. These important changes were as follows:</p><p><strong>Increase in Arbitration Filing Fee:</strong> In accordance with the Code of Ethics and Arbitration Manual, the HGAR Board of Directors unanimously voted to increase the fee that is to be accompanied by all arbitrations demands, effective May 1, 2024. The new fee will be increased from $250 to $500, thus bringing the fee in line with current economic conditions and inflation.</p><p><strong>Administrative Charge in Ethics Hearings When Respondent Violates the Code of Ethics</strong>: Pursuant to the Code of Ethics and Arbitration Manual, the HGAR Board of Directors unanimously voted to establish an administrative fee of $500 that will be imposed upon any Realtor respondent found <em>in violation</em> of the Code of Ethics or other membership duty. No fee will be charged if no violation is found. This fee will be applicable for any ethics matter filed after May 1, 2024. The purpose of imposing this fee is to offset the costs related to all ethics proceedings, including costs related to staffing, hearings, filing, storage, and oversight. In the past, HGAR did not charge a fee. No fee is required to file a complaint.</p><h3 id="state-nysar-and-ny-state"><strong>State (NYSAR and NY State)</strong></h3><p><strong>New Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS)</strong>: As a reminder, the new, New York State PCDS law is now in full force. A $500 credit will no longer be permitted in lieu of providing the PCDS. Pursuant to the law, licensees representing a seller must explain the rights and responsibilities relating to the PCDS to their client, which includes: (1) the PCDS must be filled out (preferably with the guidance of the seller’s attorney); (2) it must be provided to the buyer prior to execution of a contract of sale and; (3) it must be attached to the contract of sale.</p><p>Alternatively, if the licensee is representing a buyer, they must: (1) inform the buyer that they are entitled to receive the PCDS prior to the execution of the contract of sale and; (2) that the PCDS must be attached to the contract of sale.</p><p>In the PCDS, there are new questions relating to flooding and mold. These must be filled out to the best of the seller’s knowledge. If, at some point, new information is revealed that requires the PCDS to be updated, that must be done.</p><p><strong>Cold Calling Prohibited</strong>: Cold calling in New York State is still prohibited. Failure to comply may result in a fine is now up to $20,000 for each violation (i.e. each call made).</p><p><strong>NY Freelancer Law</strong>:<strong> </strong>Originally, this new law was contained in the New York State Labor Law, but it has been amended and moved to New York State General Business Law. It will become effective Aug. 28, 2024. This law establishes unified rules relating to the creation of the independent contractor agreement, including how payment of compensation will be made between “freelance workers” (i.e. real estate agents) and the “hiring party” (i.e., the real estate brokerage). It further addresses issues of intimidation, harassment, discrimination, filing a complaint and possible recovery outcomes. An addendum to the independent contractor agreement will be provided by NYSAR for brokerages to use.</p><p><strong>NYSAR Call to Action</strong>: NYSAR is reaching out to those Realtors who live or work in the New York City area to contact their City Council member to oppose a new bill that would prohibit a landlord from collecting a broker's fee from a renter. This bill would drastically change the rental market by eliminating the ability to negotiate who pays a commission and would result in higher rents for tenants. Prohibiting this common practice could reduce the use of real estate professionals in rentals, harming both Realtors and tenants. The New York City Council will be holding a public hearing to consider this legislation on June 12, 2024.</p><p>To urge your City Council Member to oppose this bill click <a href="https://www.votervoice.net/NYRealtors/Campaigns/113195/Respond?utm_source=NYSAR+Master+List&utm_campaign=6ccda60044-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_ENEWS_090818_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f1e488a523-6ccda60044-182137555">here</a>.</p><h3 id="national-nar"><strong>National (NAR)</strong></h3><p>NAR’s proposed settlement agreement is continuing to move forward in the courts. In anticipation of its acceptance, <em>several rule changes will be taking effect on Aug. 17, 2024</em>.</p><p><strong>Written Buyer Agreements</strong><br>Effective Aug. 17, 2024, all Realtors “working with” a buyer will be required to have a written buyer agreement with that client before touring a property. This agreement must contain: (1) a provision indicating that all compensation is fully negotiable; (2) an objectively ascertainable amount and; (3) language that prohibits compensation to exceed the amount or range indicated.</p><p>As for the term “working with,” NAR has indicated that this means that if you are working as a listing agent, a broker’s agent, or a subagent, you are not “working with” a buyer (example: working at an open house). Moreover, you are not “working with” a buyer who wishes to be unrepresented (i.e. a customer).</p><p>Written buyer agreements will vary greatly. They could be exclusive, non-exclusive, limited in time, or scope, and can vary on how/what the compensation will entail. Details of what will be recommended and what will be necessary in the written buyer agreement are still developing. NYSAR, in coordination with other counsel, including HGAR, is in the process of developing these agreements.</p><p><strong>Prohibition of Compensation Publication on the MLS</strong><br>Also, a part of the proposed settlement is the agreement that NAR and its related MLSs will no longer publish cooperating compensation on the MLS and the MLS will not facilitate the publication of cooperating compensation elsewhere (example: posting on ShowingTime is prohibited). This <em>does not</em> mean that cooperating compensation is no longer an option; it only means that cooperating compensation cannot be posted on the MLS (It can be posted on a broker’s website, for example). As we all know, all compensation is fully negotiable. After an agent establishes their value proposition, a discussion should be held regarding listing side compensation, as well as whether the homeowner sees a benefit in offering cooperating compensation. Such compensation can occur in various ways: (1) cooperating compensation from the listing agent; (2) cooperating compensation direct from the seller or; (3) a seller concession. Any other option to offer cooperating compensation is also permitted; the key is that any cooperating compensation should be fully negotiated and it cannot be marketed on the MLS.</p><p>As noted, discussion should be held with the homeowner regarding all compensation, as well as how offers will be addressed, as it may be inevitable that a buyer’s agent will present their client’s offer, which would include a provision that the homeowner/listing agent pay for the buyer agent’s commission in one way or another.</p><p>Obviously, these issues continue to evolve and cannot be fully addressed in this short article. For additional information, you can click on <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/nar-settlement-faqs">facts.realtor</a> for additional information.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>While this brief article only scratches the surface of what is going on in our industry, I am hopeful that it gives you a resource to address recent issues and the links that can answer many of your questions.

    <description><![CDATA[It is important to note that while the new Good Cause Eviction Law went into effect in New York City immediately, other municipalities throughout New York State will need to opt-in by enacting this legislation if they so choose.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 20, 2024, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law, as part of the 2025 Budget, new legislation introducing critical changes to the landlord-tenant legal landscape in New York City and New York State. Notable legislation includes the newly enacted Good Cause Eviction Law and accompanying notice requirements and procedural amendments.</p><h3 id="new-article-6-a-of-the-real-property-law-the-good-cause-eviction-law"><strong>New Article 6-A of the Real Property Law: The Good Cause Eviction Law</strong></h3><p>Newly enacted Article 6-A of the Real Property Law entitled “Prohibition of Eviction Without Good Cause” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4alLfPj">https://bit.ly/4alLfPj</a>] (the “Good Cause Eviction Law”), along with related amendments, now provide for new requirements that place a cap on rent increases landlords may charge on covered housing, and introduce new requirements relating to eviction proceedings, including establishing “good cause” before a tenant could be evicted. The Good Cause Eviction Law went into effect immediately. Various other amendments, including notice requirements, and the new requirements relating to eviction proceedings, go into effect on Aug. 18, 2024.</p><h3 id="good-cause-effective-in-nyc-immediately-but-other-municipalities-must-opt-in"><strong>Good Cause Effective in NYC Immediately; But Other Municipalities Must Opt-In</strong></h3><p>It is important to note that while the new Good Cause Eviction Law went into effect in New York City immediately, other municipalities throughout New York State will need to opt-in by enacting this legislation if they so choose. If a municipality adopts the provisions of the Good Cause Eviction Law it may exempt a housing unit if such a unit has a monthly rent above a percentage of fair market rent as published by HUD, and as published for each county in the state by the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal by August 1<sup>st</sup>. The law also permits the village, town, or city to define what constitutes a “small landlord,” if it chooses to adopt the Good Cause Eviction Law.</p><p>If the local law does not provide for a different monthly rent exemption amount or does not provide a different definition of “small landlord,” then the terms contained in the Good Cause Eviction Law would apply. Additionally, it is important to note that if both a town and a village located within that town opt-in and adopt the Good Cause Eviction Law, the local law adopted by the town shall not apply in the village.</p><h3 id="exemptions-from-the-good-cause-eviction-law"><strong>Exemptions from the Good Cause Eviction Law</strong></h3><p>Section 214 of the Good Cause Eviction Law applies to “all housing accommodations,” except for the following which are exempt from the law:</p><ul>
<li>Premises owned by a “small landlord,” which is defined as any individual who does not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10 units in New York State. This also includes any individual who owns more than 10 housing units through one or more distinct entities (e.g., LLCs, corporations, etc.).</li>
<li>Owner-occupied premises with not more than 10 units.</li>
<li>A subleased unit where the sublessor seeks in good faith to recover possession for their own personal use and occupancy.</li>
<li>A unit where the possession, use or occupancy of which is solely incident to employment and such employment is or has been lawfully terminated.</li>
<li>Units that are already subject to other local, state, or federal rent regulations and eviction laws.</li>
<li>Units required to be affordable pursuant to existing local, state, and federal laws and regulations.</li>
<li>Units within a condominium or cooperative corporation, or any building, which is subject to an offering plan submitted to the attorney general.</li>
<li>Premises for which a permanent or temporary certificate of occupancy was issued on or after Jan. 1, 2009, and the exemption will be for a period of thirty (30) years after the date of such issuance.</li>
<li>Premises that qualify as a “seasonal use dwelling” under Section 7-108 of New York’s General Obligations Law [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3ygFF3s">https://bit.ly/3ygFF3s</a>].</li>
<li>Certain housing accommodations in a hospital, continuing care retirement community, assisted living facilities, adult care facilities, and senior residential communities.</li>
<li>Units in a mobile home park and transient hotels.</li>
<li>Dormitory units owned and operated by a school.</li>
<li>Housing units located within or used by a religious institution.</li>
<li>Units with rents greater than the fair market rent as published by HUD and DHCR no later than August 1st of each year, or greater than 245% of the fair market rent, unless the villages, towns, or cities that choose to opt into the Good Cause Eviction Law set their own exempt rent amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless the housing accommodations are exempt as described above, the Good Cause Eviction law will apply in all other instances. A landlord who commences an eviction proceeding will now have to establish “good cause” in order to lawfully remove a tenant from a rental unit.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%98good-cause%E2%80%99-and-the-grounds-for-removal-of-a-tenant"><strong>‘Good Cause’ and the Grounds for Removal of a Tenant</strong></h3><p>Section 216 of the Good Cause Eviction Law provides that no landlord may remove a tenant, even if that tenant has no lease or the lease has expired, unless the landlord can establish “good cause” based on one or more of the following grounds:</p><ul>
<li>The tenant has failed to pay rent due and owing, provided that the rent that was due and owing, or any portion of it, did not result from an unreasonable rent increase.</li>
<li>The tenant is violating a substantial obligation of their tenancy or is breaching a landlord’s rules and regulations (which need to be accepted by the tenant in writing and/or attached to the lease at the commencement of the tenancy or at renewal). If any rules or regulations are updated and/or implemented after the commencement of the lease, they will need to be acknowledged and agreed to in writing by the tenant.</li>
<li>The tenant is “committing or permitting a nuisance, or is maliciously or by reason of negligence damaging the housing accommodation, or the tenant's conduct interferes with the comfort and safety of the landlord or other tenants or occupants of the same or adjacent buildings or structures.”</li>
<li>Where the tenant violates or causes a violation of the law which results in the landlord being subject to civil or criminal penalties, and “provided that a state or municipal agency with jurisdiction over the tenant has issued an order requiring the tenant to vacate the housing accommodation.” The law also restricts a tenant from being evicted if (1) the tenant is able to cure the violation, and such cure would not require removal, or (2) if it is determined that the condition resulting in the violation was caused by the landlord.</li>
<li>The tenant uses or permits the premises to be used for an illegal purpose.</li>
<li>The tenant unreasonably refuses the landlord access to the premises “for making necessary repairs or improvements required by law, or for the purpose of showing the premises to a prospective purchaser, mortgagee or other person having a legitimate interest in the premises.”</li>
<li>The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the premises for the landlord's own personal use and occupancy as the landlord's principal residence, or the personal use and occupancy as principal residence of a family member. The law does not apply to premises occupied by a tenant who is 65 years of age or older or who is disabled.</li>
<li>The landlord seeks in good faith to demolish the premises. However, the landlord must make such showing by clear and convincing evidence.</li>
<li>The landlord seeks in good faith to remove the premises from the housing rental market. The landlord must also establish this by clear and convincing evidence.</li>
<li>The tenant fails to agree to reasonable changes to a lease at renewal, including increases in rent that are not unreasonable as defined in the law, and as long as written notice of the changes to the lease were provided to the tenant at least 30 days, but no more than 90 days, prior to the expiration of the current lease.</li>
<li>If a landlord seeks to: (1) recover possession of the premises for personal use, (2) demolish the premises, or (3) withdraw the premises from the rental market, the tenant shall have the right to file an action for damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief against the landlord, or a prospective purchaser of the premises, if the tenant can prove that the landlord, or the purchaser, made a false statement regarding the above three instances. If successful, the tenant would be entitled to actual damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that a landlord will not be entitled to evict a tenant if the landlord fails to comply with any of the requirements of the Good Cause Eviction Law and related legislation. The law also expressly prohibits any waiver of the applicability of the law by the parties in any lease or rental agreement and provides that any such waiver will be void as against public policy.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%98unreasonable%E2%80%99-rent-increases-are-not-permitted"><strong>‘Unreasonable’ Rent Increases Are Not Permitted</strong></h3><p>The new legislation provides that a landlord cannot unreasonably raise the rent on non-exempt housing. Under the Good Cause Eviction Law, a rent increase is deemed to be unreasonable if it exceeds the “local rent standard,” which is defined as a rent increase equal to the “inflation index” plus 5%, or 10%, whichever is lower. The “inflation index” is defined as 5% plus the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, or 10%, whichever is lower. For New York City, and any municipalities located within the counties of Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester, the CPI for “New York-Newark-Jersey City” is to be used. For all other municipalities in New York State, the CPI published for the “Northeast Region” would apply.</p><p>However, instances where a landlord charges more than the “local rent standard” a landlord may rebut the presumption that such an increase is unreasonable. A court will consider “all relevant factors” (e.g., increases in property taxes, costs of significant repairs, increases in insurance costs, etc.) in determining whether or not an increase is unreasonable.</p><h3 id="new-tenant-notice-required-on-leases-and-other-documents"><strong>New Tenant Notice Required on Leases and Other Documents</strong></h3><p>The new law also requires that a landlord, regardless of whether the unit is subject to, or exempt from, the Good Cause Eviction Law, must include the Good Cause Eviction Law Notice on all leases and lease renewals, renewal notices, default and arrears notices, and any petition filed with the court in connection with an eviction proceeding. The form of the notice is provided in the newly added Section 231-c of the Real Property Law. If the unit is exempt, a landlord is required to identify each applicable exemption in the Notice. These particular provisions of the newly enacted legislation go into effect on Aug. 18, 2024.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id=""></h2><p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: The following is an update to Legal Corner author John Dolgetta’s column published in March 2024 entitled “Squatters’ Rights &amp; Adverse Possession Issues.”</p><p>A noteworthy legislative amendment was the exclusion of “squatters” from the definition of “tenant” under the current tenancy laws.</p><p>The topic of squatters and squatters’ rights was the focus of the March 2024 article in the <em>Legal Corner</em> [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4dyh0Y6">https://bit.ly/4dyh0Y6</a>]. In the article, it was highlighted that once a squatter gained possession of and occupied an apartment or home, in certain instances, for more than 30 days, the squatter would obtain the rights of a tenant and formal eviction proceedings would need to be commenced in order to remove the individual(s).</p><p>However, the change made to Section 711 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law specifically and unequivocally excludes a “squatter” from the definition of a tenant.&nbsp; The following language was added to the section, “[a] tenant shall not include a squatter. For the purposes of this section, a squatter is a person who enters onto or intrudes upon real property without the permission of the person entitled to possession, and continues to occupy the property without title, right or permission of the owner or owner's agent or a person entitled to possession.” This small but significant change should now provide law enforcement officials with the authority and basis to remove a squatter immediately without the need for homeowners and landlords to file formal eviction proceedings at considerable expense in order to gain access to their own property, which was being unlawfully occupied.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Cross County was originally developed by Sol Atlas. The more than 70-acre property began operations with approximately 30 stores and the Cross County Hospital, which closed in the 1980s and was later redeveloped as a hotel.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YONKERS—Happy 70<sup>th</sup> birthday Cross County Shopping Center!</p><p>A true retail icon in Westchester County and New York State—the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers——officially opened for business on April 28, 1954, as one of the largest open-air shopping centers in the nation and the first large-scale shopping center in Westchester County.</p><p>Since that time, many Westchester residents have either worked at the property or shopped at the likes of storied retailers now long gone—John Wanamaker, Gimbels, Stern’s, Sears and F. W. Woolworth. It has survived 10 recessions (1958, 1961, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1982, 1990, 2001, 2007 (Great Recession) and 2020 (Covid). Most recently, it has adapted and arguably thrived, despite a change in consumer spending habits that has seen online e-commerce capturing increased market share and batter many suburban shopping centers across the nation.</p><p>Cross County was originally developed by Sol Atlas. The more than 70-acre property began operations with approximately 30 stores and the Cross County Hospital, which closed in the 1980s and was later redeveloped as a hotel. Today, Cross County features more than 80 retailers and restaurants, including: Macy’s, Target, Zara, Michael Kors, H&amp;M, Shake Shack, Longhorn Steakhouse, Olive Garden, Starbucks, Pandora, Ulta Beauty, a Hyatt Place Hotel, as well as the Yonkers campus of SUNY Westchester and totals approximately 1.2 million square feet.</p><p>Cross County Center is currently jointly owned by Marx Realty and Benenson Capital. Craig Deitelzweig, president and CEO of Marx Realty, in an interview with <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, said Cross County currently enjoys a 97% overall leased rate and a 99% leased rate for its smaller retail stores. The center’s retail mix, children’s play areas, free parking and seasonal events draw more than 14 million visitors and guests each year.</p><p>“While other shopping centers have come and gone, Cross County Center stands as an enduring beacon of excellence and has remained an iconic, thriving, and cherished neighborhood institution since it first opened in this community 70 years ago,” said Deitelzweig. “We take immense pride in this community and our role in helping to shape and foster a robust and thriving retail environment that enriches the entire region.”</p><p>Deitelzweig said that since he was appointed president and CEO of Marx Realty in 2017, a host of people have shared with him their personal history of Cross County. “The beauty of Cross County center is I can’t tell you how many people I have met who say, ‘It was the first place I bought a suit,’ or “It was the place I had my first kiss ever,” he said.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/Cross-County-Center--Yonkers--NY-c1950s-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="700" height="445" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Cross-County-Center--Yonkers--NY-c1950s-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/Cross-County-Center--Yonkers--NY-c1950s-1.jpg 700w"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The grand opening of Cross County Shopping Center was in 1954. The original property included about 30 stores and the multi-story Cross County Hospital.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>He noted that in recent years the property has undergone significant upgrades, including the redevelopment of the former Sears store into a new Target (opened October 2023) and space for SUNY Westchester (opened November 2022). In addition, a new park was added adjacent to the Target/SUNY Westchester space that connects the Target building to the rest of the center.</p><p>“We’ve also really changed up the green space throughout the center,” he noted. Since the center is almost fully leased, “the plan is to add more retail because we just can’t meet the demand,” he related.</p><p>Deitelzweig said that while no plans have been presented to the city as yet, he estimates the planned expansion would involve approximately 60,000 square feet of new (multi-tenant) retail space, as well as green space.</p><p>Cross County, unlike many retail centers across the nation, enjoys stiff competition for spaces that become available or come up for renewal. “We really have a hard decision to make whether we want to renew that tenant or bring in new tenants. Oftentimes, we will have seven options to choose from and this is great for the center because we always want to make it cutting-edge and have the best retailers out there,” Deitelzweig said.</p><h3 id="bricks-and-mortar-retail-is-alive-and-well"><strong>Bricks and Mortar Retail is Alive and Well</strong></h3><p>While enclosed retail malls have been struggling, outdoor centers are doing quite well, he said. He attributes Cross County’s longevity and continued success in part to its strategic location, adjacent to the New York State Thruway, Cross County Parkway and Central Avenue retail corridor.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/Gimbels.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="662" height="298" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Gimbels.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/Gimbels.jpg 662w"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">One-time anchor of Cross County was Gimbels department store.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>“I think Cross County is doing extremely well because it is so well-located, people love being at Cross County. It has been part of the community for 70 years so we have a bit of a head start here,” he said. “We have always been at the forefront of making sure that the spaces are very engaging as part of the community. I think that has been a part of our success, making sure that we are doing events that bring people to the center and making sure that the retail mix is always evolving the best it can be.”</p><p>He boasts that many national retail stores at Cross County are either the top, second or third in gross sales of all their stores across the country.</p><p>In fact, Cross County boasts the first Zara, Shake Shack and now Savage X Fenty by Rihanna in Westchester County. The Savage X Fenty lingerie brand is opening in June at Cross County. In addition, Cross County’s only pizza restaurant‑Honey Pizza will be making its debut in June.</p><p>Cross County Center kicked off its milestone celebration with an expanded Summer Fest 2024. The series began on Saturday, May 18<sup>th</sup> at noon, inviting visitors to embark on a nostalgic journey back to 1954. The day celebrated Cross County Center through the decades, featuring strolling entertainers, music and selfie stations representing different eras, and a Pop-Up Roller Skating Rink. Additional events marking the 70<sup>th</sup> Anniversary will take place throughout the year as part of the celebration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[This dispute could have far-reaching implications beyond the real estate industry, as the split-decision ruling from the Circuit Court conflicts with the existing precedent of both the D.C. Circuit Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor’s Note</em>: This article first appeared in <em>Realtor Magazine</em>.</p><p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors on Monday (May 20) petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for a rehearing, challenging its ruling that would allow the Department of Justice to reopen a previously closed investigation into NAR’s policies. In the filing, which forcefully advocates for the interests of members, NAR outlines the flaws in the reasoning for the appeals court’s majority decision in favor of the DOJ. This dispute focuses only on the department’s ability to unilaterally withdraw from its settlement agreement with NAR. It does not address any of the department’s claims about NAR policies or antitrust topics.</p><p>In 2020, the DOJ and NAR reached an agreement to end an investigation into certain NAR policies—including the cooperative compensation rule and clear cooperation policy—provided that NAR modify four of its policies. NAR fully complied with that agreement, including by submitting proposed rule changes to the DOJ for its review.</p><p>Eight months later, the DOJ resumed its investigation into these policies despite the settlement agreement. At the time, the DOJ did not provide additional information to support reopening the investigation, saying it simply was “its preference to do so.” NAR subsequently challenged this decision and asked the District Court for the District of Columbia to prohibit the DOJ from pursuing its investigation.</p><p>The district court held the DOJ had to abide by its prior agreement. Ruling in favor of the DOJ “would make its commitment to close the investigation a letter worth nothing but the paper on which it was written,” Judge Timothy Kelly wrote.</p><p>The DOJ appealed the district court’s determination, and in early April, the DC Circuit held in a 2–1 decision that DOJ’s 2020 settlement with NAR does not prevent it from reopening its investigation. In his dissenting opinion, Judge Justin R. Walker wrote that no court had previously “endorsed such a reading” of a contract made by the U.S. government and that the decision permits the government to agree to “close” a case or investigation to “lure a party into the false comfort of a settlement agreement, take what it can get, and then reopen the investigation seconds later.”</p><p>The government should be held to the terms of its contracts, NAR argues in today’s filing, saying, “the panel’s errors are far-reaching and exceptionally important. Every day, federal agencies resolve civil and criminal enforcement actions through agreements with private parties. It is a bedrock principle that the government must honor its word in those contracts, no matter who occupies the White House or leads the Antitrust Division.”</p><p>This dispute could have far-reaching implications beyond the real estate industry, as the split-decision ruling from the Circuit Court conflicts with the existing precedent of both the D.C. Circuit Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. As NAR outlines in its filing, the decision handed down from the D.C. Circuit “will reshape the landscape for all who ‘find themselves on the other side of the bargaining table’ with the government.”</p><p>The decision by NAR to pursue additional review is an indication of its intention to pursue all available options to defend its membership. In a statement, NAR said, “As part of our commitment to championing the interests of our members and the home buying and selling public, we are petitioning the court to review the April 5, 2024, decision, uphold the district court’s determination, and hold the Department of Justice to the terms of our 2020 agreement.”</p><p>The petition, if successful, will provide an additional opportunity for the D.C. Circuit to review and reverse the DOJ’s ability to reopen the investigation.</p><p>The dispute with the DOJ does not affect NAR’s March 15 settlement agreement related to private class action litigation. A hearing is scheduled in November for final approval of that agreement; if approved, the settlement would resolve nationwide litigation over claims from home sellers related to broker commissions.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story is unrelated to the private class action litigation in which NAR is a defendant and NAR’s pending settlement agreement in that litigation.</em></p><p><strong><em>Reprinted from REALTOR® Magazine Online (</em></strong><a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>http://realtormag.realtor.org</em></strong></a><strong><em>), May 20, 2024, with permission of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS®.

    <description><![CDATA[New listings of single-family homes rose in the Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, and Orange counties, while pending sales for all property types increased in every region except Rockland and Orange counties.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—In a surprising turn of events, April’s closed sales of single-family homes experienced double-digit increases in Rockland and Westchester counties, at 33.3% and 22.7%, respectively. Orange County’s sales increased by 3.9% in April. The median sales price for single-family homes also grew significantly in all areas except the Bronx, which saw a slight decline of just 0.7%. As expected, Westchester County reported the highest single-family median sales price at $870,000, followed by Rockland at $735,00 and the Bronx at $600,000.</p><p>Today’s report by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, based on data supplied by OneKey MLS, also indicates that sales of single-family homes in the Bronx, Putnam and Sullivan counties decreased in April. The largest decline was in Putnam at 32.3%, followed by the Bronx at 31.4% and Sullivan at 22.2%.</p><p>New listings of single-family homes rose in the Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, and Orange counties, while pending sales for all property types increased in every region except Rockland and Orange counties. Westchester showed the highest amount of new single-family listings at 11.3% over this time last year, while Putnam County had the highest growth in overall pending sales at 17.6%.</p><p>Condos in Rockland and Orange counties saw double-digit jumps in median sales prices, while median sales prices for condos in the Bronx and Westchester decreased by double-digits. Rockland County’s median-priced condo sold for $390,000 – an increase of 12.6%. Conversely, new listings for condos declined in both Rockland and Orange counties, while increasing in the Bronx, Westchester, and Putnam counties.</p><p>Co-op median sales prices were also on the rise in the Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, and Orange counties. Orange County experienced the highest gain of 95%, with a median price of $195,000, up from just $100,000 in April 2023.</p><p>However, demand continues to outpace supply. Single-family homes in Westchester County saw the largest drop at 25.2%. “While inventory remains low across our region, signs are pointing to a more vibrant spring and summer market with both new listings and pending sales growing,” said Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO. “The fact that property sales continue to rise is also a good indicator of the consistent demand for housing in our region.”</p><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Single-family home sales dropped by 31.4% and the median sales price also dipped slightly by 0.7% to just $600,000.

Last year at this time, the median was $174,000.</p><p>New Bronx listings for co-ops climbed the highest at 11.5%, followed by single-family homes at 8.3% and condos at 2.9%. Pending sales for all property types were up by 13.8%. Overall inventory for all three housing types was down significantly, with condo supply faring the worst with a 41.3% decline. There were 32.8% fewer single-family homes on the market, and 14.9% less co-ops. April showed 6.1% months of supply for all property types, a 20.8% decline from 2023.</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>Sales of condos in April experienced the highest jump at 32.5%, compared to single home sales with an 11.3% gain. Co-op sales, however, saw a decline of 15.1%. The median sales price for single-family homes keeps climbing – this time by 16.4% to $870,000. In April 2023, the median was $747,500. Co-op median sales prices rose by 5.6% to $190,000, while the median for condos declined by 10.3% to $477,500.

New listings for condos saw a 55.6% increase, while single-family home listings grew by 9.4%. Pending sales for all property types are on the rise by 17.6%. Inventory declined for both single-family homes – at 21.7% – and condos – at 7.7%. All property types saw a 4% decline in months of supply from last year to just 2.4 months.</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Sales of condos in Rockland County had the biggest jump at 36.4%. There was also an uptick in the median sales price of Rockland’s condos at 12.6% over last year, bringing April’s price to $390.000.

Inventory for both property types decreased, with condos at 35.4% less units, and 24.1% less single-family homes. Pending sales for all property types decreased by 17.5%. Orange County properties have a three-month supply, which is a 6.3% decline from 2023.</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>While Sullivan County’s single-family home sales declined 22.2% in April, the median sales price grew by 10% to $320,000. New listings declined by 0.9% and the inventory remained the same. Pending sales of single-family homes increased by 3.4% in April. Only Sullivan County experienced a gain in months of supply.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales receded in April, according to a report released today (May 21) by the National Association of Realtors. All four major U.S. regions posted month-over-month declines. Year-over-year, sales decreased in the Northeast, Midwest and South but increased in the West.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—slid 1.9% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million in April. Year-over-year, sales fell 1.9% (down from 4.22 million in April 2023).</p><p>“Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizable gain due to more supply coming onto the market,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from March and 16.3% from one year ago (1.04 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.5-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.2 months in March and 3.0 months in April 2023. For homes priced $1 million or more, inventory and sales increased by 34% and 40%, respectively, from a year ago.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in April was $407,600, an increase of 5.7% from the previous year ($385,800). All four U.S. regions registered price gains.</p><p>“Home prices reaching a record high for the month of April is very good news for homeowners,” Yun added. “However, the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index"><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 26 days in April, down from 33 days in March but up from 22 days in April 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 33% of sales in April, up from 32% in March and 29% in April 2023. NAR's 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in April, identical to March and one year ago.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in April, up from 15% in March but down from 17% in April 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in April, virtually unchanged from last month and the prior year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates"><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02% as of May 16. That's down from 7.09% the previous week but up from 6.39% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales"><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-Op Sales</strong></h3><p>Single-family home sales decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.74 million in April, down 2.1% from 3.82 million in March and 1.3% from the prior year. The median existing single-family home price was $412,100 in April, up 5.6% from April 2023.</p><p>At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 400,000 units in April, existing condominium and co-op sales were unchanged from last month and down 7% from one year ago (430,000 units). The median existing condo price was $365,300 in April, up 5.4% from the previous year ($346,700).</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown"><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast waned 4% from March to an annual rate of 480,000 in April, a decline of 4% from April 2023.

The median price in the Midwest was $303,600, up 6% from April 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South descended 1.6% from March to an annual rate of 1.9 million in April, down 3.1% from the prior year. The median price in the South was $366,200, up 3.7% from last year.</p><p>In the West, existing-home sales retracted 2.6% from a month ago to an annual rate of 760,000 in April, an increase of 1.3% from one year before. The median price in the West was $629,600, up 9.3% from April 2023.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/NAR-EHS-April-2024-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/NAR-EHS-April-2024-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/05/NAR-EHS-April-2024-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[NAR had several topics it wanted HGAR and the rest of the Realtor community on the Hill that day to hammer home.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of this month, Realtors from across the nation gathered in Washington, D.C. Unlike recent years, visits with our Congress members were back on the agenda. Mostly because of Covid restrictions and other security issues, NAR Legislative conferences have been informative but have missed the all-important visits with elected officials on their turf. Much like how the NYSAR Lobby days see a level of success because we flood the capital with Realtors, the Hill was once again filled with housing professionals educating our elected leaders on our issues.</p><p>Last year, NAR opted for the creative exercise of dropping a meeting with Congress members and their staff on the Hill and instead invited them to National Stadium to enjoy a hotdog, a beer and individual Realtors talking politics with them. To say the very least, everyone was pleased to see Hill visits return. Led by Legislative Co-Chair Leah Caro, President Carmen Bauman and CEO Lynda Fernandez, a group of HGAR members met with five different Congressmembers and their offices.</p><p>NAR had several topics it wanted HGAR and the rest of the Realtor community on the Hill that day to hammer home. Namely, that real estate is 16% of the US’s GDP. In addition to that, addressing housing affordability necessitates increasing the nation’s housing inventory, which is currently 5.5 million units short, representing a $4.4-trillion underinvestment.</p><p>Some of our key legislative actions included:</p><p><strong>More Homes on the Market Act</strong> (H.R. 1321): Raises capital gains exclusion on home sales, adjusting for inflation, to motivate long-term owners to sell.</p><p><strong>Neighborhood Homes Investment Act</strong> (S. 657, H.R. 3940): Offers tax credits to encourage building and rehabilitating homes in underserved areas.</p><p><strong>Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act</strong> (S. 1557, H.R. 3238): Expands the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to boost affordable housing.</p><p><strong>Additional Support</strong>:</p><p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserve the 199A qualified business income deduction.</p><p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maintain 1031 like-kind exchanges.</p><p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the SALT deduction cap.</p><p>Additionally, promoting fair housing, protecting real estate professionals' independent contractor status, and ensuring veteran access to representation are essential priorities. These efforts aim to stabilize communities, enhance economic growth and ensure equal housing opportunities for all.</p><p>We had a meeting with the staff of Reps. Pat Ryan, Adriano Espaillat, Ritchie Torres, Mike Lawler, Jamaal Bowman and Daniel Goldman. With a special shout out to Ritchie Torres, who was aware of our issues before the meeting, and Rep. Lawler for meeting with us in person.</p><p>In D.C., many Congress members and their staff genuinely were unaware of what pieces of legislation were out there. Our team from HGAR did a great job of educating our elected officials and even now some members are signing into legislation as we speak.</p><p>I will have more to report on as the follow-up from our advocacy efforts continue. In the meantime, the effectiveness of Hill visits is ever-present and a welcome return. Our members from HGAR left feeling empowered and our members in Congress left our meeting feeling better informed. It was a good day had by all and a lot of good trouble made by most.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on May 28 that federal assistance is available to New Yorkers in Ontario, Orange, and contiguous counties who were impacted by last year’s early July flood event. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—Homeowners and businesses in the Hudson Valley who suffered property damage from the devastating flood event on July 9-10, 2023 can now secure some much-needed financial assistance from the Small Business Administration.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on May 28 that federal assistance is available to New Yorkers in Ontario, Orange, and contiguous counties who were impacted by last year’s early July flood event. Residents and businesses are now eligible to apply for U.S. Small Business Administration low-interest loans to aid in recovery from the severe weather event that resulted in significant damage to homes and businesses.</p><p>“After devastating floods caused extreme damage across New York last July, I'm thankful for the federal assistance that will help relieve New Yorkers and small businesses that have suffered,” Gov. Hochul said. "My administration is working directly with FEMA to ensure our local government partners receive the critical funding they need to recover and rebuild.</p><p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors received high praise from local officials, including Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, for providing much-needed assistance to the flood victims in the days and weeks following the storm. Almost immediately after the severe weather event, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors applied for and was bestowed a $500,000 grant from the National Association of Realtors “REALTOR Relief Foundation" to assist Hudson Valley homeowners who were affected by the devastating storms. In December 2023, HGAR reported that its Realtor Relief Assistance Team distributed a total of $356,079.26 to 209 households and received the New York State Senate Empire Award for its role in the Relator Relief program.</p><p>Staff from the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and local government partners conducted a thorough assessment of the damages related to this storm directly after the event, which resulted in Governor’s Hochul request to FEMA for Individual Assistance. Earlier this year, FEMA denied the governor’s request, which makes these SBA loans vital to those seeking recovery, state officials noted.</p><p>Homeowners, residents and businesses in Ontario and Orange counties, as well as the contiguous counties of Monroe, Wayne, Seneca, Yates, Steuben, Livingston, Sullivan, Ulster, Dutchess, Putnam, Westchester, Rockland, are now eligible for the SBA loans. SBA loans can be very helpful to eligible parties who need financial assistance to get on the road to recovery following weather-related disasters and other emergencies.</p><p>The following groups may be eligible for SBA disaster loans:</p><ul>
<li>Homeowners: up to $500,000 to repair their primary residence.<br>
Homeowners and renters: up to $100,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property.</li>
<li>Business owners: up to $2,000,000 for the replacement of real property, inventories, machinery, equipment, and other physical losses.</li>
<li>Businesses and non-profits: Economic Injury Disaster Loans of up to $2,000,000 to provide necessary working capital until normal operations resume after a disaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>DHSES is working with the SBA to open physical locations for Disaster Loan Outreach Centers (DLOCs) in Ontario and Orange counties to help New Yorkers apply in person for assistance. Starting Wednesday, May 29, Customer Support Representatives will be available to help applicants with applications and to answer questions about the SBA disaster loan program, including a facility in Highland Falls that was scheduled to open yesterday.</p><p>Village of Highland Falls Senior Center: 15 Drew Avenue, Highland Falls, NY 10928<br>Opening Day &amp; Time: Wednesday, May 29, 2024 at 12:00 p.m.<br>Daily Hours of Operation:<br>Monday – Saturday: 10:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.<br>Sunday: Closed.<br>Closing Day &amp; Time: Wednesday, June 12, 2024 at 6:00 p.m.</p><p>New Yorkers can find additional information, download applications, and apply online. They may also call SBA's Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955 or email disastercustomerservice@sba.gov.</p><p>Individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability, can dial 7-1-1 to access telecommunications relay services.</p><p>Completed applications should be mailed to the U.S. Small Business Administration, Processing and Disbursement Center, 14925 Kingsport Road, Fort Worth, TX 76155. The filing deadline to return applications for physical property damage is July 15, 2024. The deadline to return economic injury applications is Feb. 18, 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—U.S. pending home sales in April fell 7.7%, the National Association of Realtors reported on May 30. All four U.S. regions registered month-over-month and year-over-year decreases, although the Northeast posted the smallest decline for the month.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—decreased to 72.3 in April. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 7.4%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“The impact of escalating interest rates throughout April dampened home buying, even with more inventory in the market,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “But the Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cut later this year should lead to better conditions, with improved affordability and more supply.”</p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown"><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The Northeast PHSI fell 3.5% from last month to 62.9, a decline of 3.1% from April 2023.

The West index decreased 8.5% in April to 55.9, down 7.3% from April 2023.</p><p>“Home prices are hitting record highs, but the pace of gains should decelerate with more supply,” said Yun. “However, the prospect of measurable home price declines appears minimal.

    <description><![CDATA[The New York metro region’s median listing price of $789,000 in May 2024 was 34% higher than in May 2019.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA CA—Median home list prices have increased 37.5% since May 2019, and while prices grew in that time frame, inventory is down 34.2% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels pointing to the market being in seller-friendly territory, according to the Realtor.com May housing data released on June 4.</p><p>The New York metro market (New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA) ranked the highest among the nation’s metropolitan markets with an 84.7% increase in the median listing price per square foot compared to May 2019. The New York metro region’s median listing price of $789,000 in May 2024 was 34% higher than in May 2019. The next highest increase in median listing price per square foot was in the Boston metro market (Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH) at 72.9%. The Nashville metro market (Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN) came in third with a 68.6% increase since May 2019.</p><p>“In addition to higher median list prices and fewer homes for sale versus 2019, the increase in median price per square foot suggests that the typical home on the market today is worth 52.7% more than before the pandemic, more than double the roughly 23% increase in consumer price inflation in this period,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com.</p><p>She continued, “The specifics will vary from market to market, but the data suggest ongoing opportunity for many sellers. Though with mortgage rates still much higher than many existing homeowners enjoy, this opportunity favors sellers who don't have to replace a mortgage, such as investors or second homeowners looking for an exit, or equity-rich homeowners looking to downsize in their current area or to a lower-cost region, as well as those planning to rent their next home.”</p><h3 id="a-closer-look-at-price-per-square-foot">A Closer Look at Price per Square Foot</h3><p>The median price of homes for sale this May remained relatively stable growing from $441,000 last year to $442,500 this year, a slight increase of 0.3%. However, a closer look at the median price per square foot, which can be seen as a better indication of home value, shows an increase of 3.8%. The difference between the percent change in median listing price and median price per square foot shows that, in this time frame, the share of inventory of smaller and more affordable homes has grown, which helps hold down the median price even as per square foot prices grow further. When looking at pre-pandemic levels, across the country the median price per square foot experienced staggering increases. Nearly half of the 50 metros included in the report saw an increase in median price per square foot of at least 50% since 2019</p><h3 id="income-required-continues-to-rise">Income Required Continues to Rise</h3><p>The increase in median price per square foot between May 2019 and now can be seen as a positive for sellers, especially considering the growth of 52.7% suggests the median home on the market is worth that much more today than pre-pandemic. However, for buyers, the increase could mean being priced out for certain homes if their household income did not experience similar or greater growth, especially when taking higher mortgage rates into account. This May, the typical monthly mortgage payment of the median home grew by roughly $158 compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $6,400, to $119,700, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.</p><h3 id="inventory-rises-with-more-affordable-homes-entering-the-market">Inventory Rises with More Affordable Homes Entering the Market</h3><p>For the seventh straight month, homes actively for sale rose, with 35.2% more homes actively for sale in May 2024, compared with the same time last year. A few metros saw huge gains in active listings year-over-year including Tampa (87.4%), Phoenix (80.3%), and Orlando (78.0%). A deeper dive into the mix of homes for sale shows a 46.6% increase in homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range across the country year-over-year, even surpassing last month's high of 41.0%, indicating affordable homes continue to enter the market; some much-welcomed news for prospective buyers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;WHITE PLAINS—The need for more affordable housing was at the crux of discussions at a recent Hudson Valley Economic Development Powerhouse Roundtable, presented by HGAR’s Commercial &amp; Investment Division. Panelists called for local governments to consider more creative zoning options that could increase workforce housing while reducing job-related stress for both employers and employees.</p><p>Moderated by Adam Bosch, CEO, Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, the roundtable held on May 23 at the HGAR offices in White Plains included: Kathleen Ables, President, Putnam County Economic Development Corp.; Steve Gross, Director, Orange County Economic Development; Deborah Novick, Director, Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation, Westchester County; and Rafael A. Roger, Vice President, Bronx Economic Development Corp.</p><p>Bosch noted that lower birth rates, smaller families and outward migration from New York is adding to the workforce stress, as many firms struggle to find adequate and qualified help. “We don’t have enough humans to fill these jobs, and this is becoming a real challenge,” said Novick. “We need more affordability and availability of housing—the key things to change in order to bring in the workforce.” Roger echoed those sentiments, noting that the Bronx is in the same situation as the Hudson Valley when it comes to housing. “Affordability is a real issue,” he said. “People are leaving New York because of that.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/06/CID-Panelists-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1993" height="1273" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/CID-Panelists-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/CID-Panelists-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/06/CID-Panelists-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/06/CID-Panelists-1.jpg 1993w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Standing, from left: Clayton Livingston, HGAR CID President; Deborah Novick, Director, Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation, Westchester County; Rafael A.

With high rents also pricing people out of the area, the panelists believe that could create a domino effect. “The healthcare industry is feeling the stress of maintaining its workforce, and many nurses are on contract from somewhere else. We won’t have the goods and services we need without the people who provide the and we won’t have the people without places they can afford to live,” Bosch said.</p><p>Ables agreed that communities throughout our region need to rethink their zoning options when it comes to accessory apartments. “There’s nothing wrong with having apartments over retail stores or more mother/daughter apartments, where parents could help with childcare,” she said. “Some towns are welcoming to these types of housing, and as family size shrinks, maybe home sizes should as well.” Tiny home communities were mentioned as another alternative.</p><p>Gross contends that keeping their master plans up to date is essential for all cities, towns and villages. “Things like floating zones can help to make plans more adaptable,” he said, citing the case of an Orange County film studio, where the owners wanted to allow employees to live there while filming was taking place, but the area was not zoned for temporary residences.</p><p>Bosch stressed that with today’s high cost of home purchases and rentals, it’s so important for local zoning to match the needs of the local communities. Roger agreed. “Right now, in the Bronx, what we have on the books does not match what we need. Some of the zoning laws are so old that they talk about storage facilities for horse and buggies.”</p><p>Citing the progress made by some Westchester communities, Novick commended them for innovative zoning for housing. “If we don’t have young, vibrant families in our communities, we don’t have a workforce,” she said. Bosch also cautioned against potential community backlash at plans to provide more affordable housing.</p><p>“We know that 97 of our 127 school districts in the region are shrinking—some by more than 50%,” he explained. “That’s 45,000 fewer kids in school now than in 2003. The biggest myth in the Hudson Valley is that the schools won’t be able to handle more children coming in.”</p><p>Gross added that quality of life is also just as important when reimagining zoning to augment the workforce. “Employers want to be able to offer exciting things for their employees to do such as walking trails, restaurants, and recreational facilities,” he said.</p><p>Currently, the demand in Putnam County is trending towards redevelopment and adaptive reuse. Ables cited plans for Brewster Crossing, a five to six-story building with 408 rental apartments, a 500-space garage, brewery, retail and dining business, plus 20,000 square feet of municipal office space. Groundbreaking is set for 2025 on a 5.4-acre tract of land in the downtown area.</p><p>In Westchester, Novick touted transit-oriented developments in White Plains, New Rochelle and Port Chester, plus new housing in former office buildings. Roger agreed that housing growth along the Metro-North Railroad and subways is in demand in the Bronx. “The old post office on 149th Street is for sale and that could be gutted and renovated for many other uses,” he said.</p><p>“New York State is setting aside a lot of money for adaptive reuse, and many times that money goes underutilized,” Bosch said. “It’s important that communities, commercial brokers and developers know about these programs so that money doesn’t end up sitting on the shelf.</p><p>For Orange County, Gross said commercial developers are looking for proximity to markets, accessibility to major highways and strong infrastructure. The need for distribution centers is trending now.</p><p>As for the industry sectors where each county sees growth, Gross puts tourism and hospitality at the top of the list. “We have Legoland, City Winery, Angry Orchard and now there’s a feasibility study underway for a new conference center,” he noted. “I think Orange County is also well-positioned for a film and movie sector.” The 2022 Oscar award-winning film, “The Whale,” starring Brenden Fraser, was filmed in Newburgh.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/06/CID-Sponsors-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1215" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/CID-Sponsors-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/CID-Sponsors-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/06/CID-Sponsors-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/06/CID-Sponsors-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">HGAR thanks the event sponsors—Start Elevator, Webster Bank and CoStar (not pictured).</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>For the Bronx, Roger cited life and health sciences as the growth area, given the proximity of major hospitals like Montefiore Medical Center and Jacobi Medical Center. “We also have Hunts Point—the largest food market in the country, and there are plans for opening a new facility,” he said.</p><p>Novick also sees life sciences as the point of steady growth for Westchester. “Regeneron is the largest private sector life science employer in the state, and they are looking at plans for a massive expansion to add about 1,000 jobs over the next six years,” she said. The New York Blood Center has purchased the former Avon campus in Rye and plans to add 400 jobs when it opens this fall.</p><p>Putnam County is also experiencing a shift toward medical development with updates to Putnam Hospital and several new walk-in clinics. “We also expect to see growth in warehousing and expansion of existing industrial facilities,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Former President of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Drew Kessler and his wife Vicki are continuing their recovery after suffering serious injuries aboard a Singapore Airlines flight on May 21 hit by severe turbulence that caused the airliner to plummet thousands of feet. The incident required the Boeing 777-300ER flight from London to Singapore to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, Thailand.</p><p>Kessler, who served as HGAR President in 2015, was traveling to the Rotary International Convention in Singapore (May 25-29), accompanied by his wife Vicki and their two sons Jackson and Brandon. Hours after the incident, Kessler shared via social media that that plane dropped approximately 6,000 feet in seconds. One passenger, a 73-year-old British man, died from what was a suspected heart attack, according to a <em>BBC</em> report.</p><p>Kessler, who is Senior Vice President of the Commercial Real Estate division at M&amp;T Bank, suffered a broken neck, while Vicki sustained a broken back. Both injuries required surgeries and hospital stays overseas and in Sarasota, FL. A longtime Rotarian, Kessler currently serves as a 2022-24 Rotary International Director and is a member of The Rotary Club of North Rockland, New York. Despite his injuries, Drew and his sons did participate in the Rotary International Convention proceedings.</p><p>Since the incident, Kessler, who had no comment for this story, provided periodic updates via social media on his and his wife’s recoveries. On May 31, he chronicled the more than 30-hour plane trip from Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand to New Jersey and then Florida so that Drew and Vicki could continue their recovery at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>His latest posting via Facebook on June 8 noted they had successfully returned home to Hopewell Junction on June 5 and were “embracing our new normal.” Several days later, Drew and Vicki ventured out to watch Jackson on the soccer field and then Brandon on a local baseball diamond.</p><p>He concluded his Facebook post, stating: “It is a gorgeous day and we are enjoying our new normal for all that it has to offer. I will continue to express our gratitude for all of the well wishes we have received. Thank you for keeping us in your thoughts.”</p><p>Richard Haggerty, who at the time of Kessler’s tenure as HGAR President in 2025, was the CEO of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, heard about the Kessler’s harrowing experience and was pleased to learn the family is back home and recovering. “Thank goodness Drew and his wife Vicki and his family are OK. For those that may not know, Drew was one of the driving forces behind the merger that created the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (in 2012),” Haggerty, who is the Chief Executive Officer of OneKeyMLS, said.</p><p>In addition to his service to the Rotary, Kessler also served as president of the Rockland County Board of Realtors and a director for both the New York State Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors. While At HGAR, he launched the HG Realtor Foundation. A passionate fundraiser, Kessler has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for organizations including The Rotary Foundation, Habitat for Humanity March of Dimes and Feeding Westchester.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[It is important for an attorney to inform the seller the Property Condition Disclosure Statement does not require a seller to make any independent investigations relating to the subject matter contained in each of the questions contained therein.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been nearly three months since the amendments to the updated Property Condition Disclosure Act (“PCDA”) [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3Xi8B5C">https://bit.ly/3Xi8B5C</a>] have gone into effect (i.e., March 20, 2024) and it appears, from a transactional standpoint, that both attorneys and real estate agents, at least in downstate New York State, are still getting used to the new PCDA and the requirement to provide a completed Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) under Section 462 of the Real Property Law [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4cfCWWn">https://bit.ly/4cfCWWn</a>]. Attorneys and real estate agents need to acclimate to the new requirements so as to avoid delays and move transactions along seamlessly.</p><h3 id="differences-in-customs-developed-early-on-upstate-vs-downstate"><strong>Differences in Customs Developed Early On: Upstate vs. Downstate</strong></h3><p>Prior to March 20<sup>th</sup>, it was a well-settled practice for sellers in southern New York not to complete and deliver the PCDS to purchasers. Instead, sellers opted to provide purchasers with a $500 credit at closing. In upstate New York, however, where broker-prepared real estate contracts, subject to attorney review, are commonplace, it has been a customary practice for sellers to provide a completed PCDS to purchasers, thereby avoiding the credit.</p><p>One reason for the difference in custom is that in upstate markets, where real estate prices were (and still are) comparatively lower than downstate values, many sellers opted to complete the PCDS and not provide the $500 credit. In downstate New York, attorneys and sellers quickly chose to provide the $500 credit instead. The higher real estate prices, and the perceived exposure to liability for providing a PCDS, made it an easy choice for sellers.</p><p><em>The Real Estate Licensees’ Duty Under Section 466</em></p><p>As pointed out in the October 2023 Legal Corner article [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3VBBt7F">https://bit.ly/3VBBt7F</a>], while Section 466 of the RPL was not modified, it is important to review the duties of a real estate licensee in connection with the PCDS. Section 466 provides as follows:</p><p>“An agent representing a seller of residential real property as a listing broker shall have the duty to timely inform each seller represented by that agent of the seller’s obligations under this article. An agent representing a buyer of residential real property, or, if the buyer is not represented by an agent, the agent representing a seller of residential real property and dealing with a prospective buyer, shall have the duty to timely (in any event, before the buyer signs a binding contract of sale) inform such buyer of the buyer’s rights and obligations under this article.”</p><p>As long as real estate agents “perform the duties and obligations imposed” under Section 466, they “shall have no further duties under this article and shall not be liable to any party for a violation of this article.” The “timely” requirement becomes much more important now that sellers will be delivering the PCDS. Additionally, the New York State Association of Realtors created general broker/agent disclosure confirmation forms, which real estate licensees may choose to use so they can document compliance with the requirements. While these forms are optional, it is strongly recommended that agents utilize them.</p><p><em>Important Practical Considerations for Real Estate<br>Agents Resulting from the Amended PCDA</em></p><p>While the legal obligations and duties of the real estate licensee under Section 466 of the PCDA have not changed, there are new practical considerations that should be considered. With the elimination of the $500 credit, now, under Section 462, “every seller of residential real property pursuant to a real estate purchase contract shall complete and sign a property condition disclosure statement…and cause it, or a copy thereof, to be delivered to a buyer or buyer's agent prior to the signing by the buyer of a binding contract of sale.” On upstate transactions, brokers usually fill in and prepare the form contract of sale (which is subject to attorney review). The agent would also obtain the completed PCDS from the seller, attach it to the form contract of sale, and transmit everything to the parties and their attorneys.</p><p>In contrast, on downstate transactions, a memorandum of sale is prepared by the seller’s agent and transmitted to the buyer’s agent and the parties’ attorneys. The seller’s attorney would then prepare the contract of sale and send it to the buyer’s attorney for review. Prior to the amendment, after there was initial discussion between the agents, attorneys, and clients about the PCDS and the $500 credit, there usually would be no further mention of the PCDS. The seller’s attorney would simply include a provision in the contract of sale indicating that the seller would be providing the purchaser with a $500 credit in lieu of delivery of the PCDS.</p><p><em>The Seller, Seller’s Agent and the PCDS</em></p><p>Now that the PCDS is required to be delivered under the PCDA, and attached to the contract of sale, it is important for the seller’s agent to inform the seller in a “timely manner” of the seller’s obligation to complete the PCDS. Discussions between the seller and the seller’s agent regarding the PCDA and the PCDS form should be had at the early stages of the real estate transaction, for example, when the Section 443 Disclosure documents are provided to the seller. While the seller’s agent should provide a copy of the PCDS form to a seller, it is important to note that the seller’s agent should <u>not</u> assist the seller in completing the form. The seller’s agent should recommend that the seller-client contact their attorney immediately so that they may discuss the legal requirements and ramifications of the PCDA, and to request assistance from their attorney in completing the form. Once the seller has completed the PCDS the seller should provide it to seller’s attorney.</p><p>The PCDS form should be completed and signed by the seller, and should be ready before there is an accepted offer on the property so that when the contract is prepared the PCDS is ready to be attached to it as required under Section 462. If the sellers wait until the contract of sale is prepared to complete the PCDS and only then discuss the PCDA with their attorney, it will inevitably delay the process. In the current environment, sellers want to lock in a potential purchaser as soon as possible, and purchasers do not want to risk losing out on a particular property. On some recent transactions, sellers have not completed the PCDS in advance and this has caused delays in preparing and transmitting contracts.</p><p>Since the enactment of the new PCDA, some purchasers’ attorneys have been demanding that they receive the completed PCDS form before they even begin their review of the contract of sale, hence, another reason why it should be done early on.</p><p><em>The Buyer, Buyer’s Agent and the PCDA</em></p><p>As mentioned above, the buyer’s agent should inform the buyer very early as well. It is important to note that if the buyer is not represented by an agent, the seller’s agent has the obligation to “timely inform the buyer of buyer’s rights and obligations” under the PCDA. Again, while there is no obligation of the buyer’s agent beyond “timely informing” the buyer of obligations and rights under the PCDA, it is recommended that the buyer’s agent request a copy of the completed PCDS from the seller’s agent prior to the buyer making an offer on the property. The PCDS may include information that may help the buyer determine what offer to make. It would also be helpful to have the PCDS before having the home inspected so the buyer’s inspector is able to review it and determine if any additional inspections are needed, or if any issues need to be further investigated.</p><p><strong>The PCDS and the Attorney’s Role</strong></p><p>The role of the attorney in downstate residential real estate transactions has also been affected by the new changes to the PCDA. As indicated above, customarily, the seller’s real estate attorney does not become involved in the real estate transaction until receipt of the memorandum of sale. Once the memorandum of sale is transmitted, and in light of the current market conditions, normally contracts are expected to be prepared and transmitted to the purchaser’s attorney the same day or the next business day, however, without the PCDS from the seller, this will not be possible.</p><p><em>The Role of the Seller’s Attorney</em></p><p>It is important for attorneys to explain to seller-clients the legal risk and exposure to liability for making false or misleading statements on the PCDS. If the seller requests assistance in completing the PCDS, the attorney should provide the seller with the necessary assistance.</p><p>It is important for an attorney to inform the seller the PCDS does not require a seller to make any independent investigations relating to the subject matter contained in each of the questions contained therein. Sellers are required to answer the questions to the best of their actual knowledge. Therefore, unless a seller personally and actually knows of an issue or knows the answer to the question, or knows for certain that a particular issue does not exist or is not applicable, then the seller would answer “Yes”, “No” or “N/A”.</p><p>If, however, the seller does not know, or is uncertain of, an answer to a question, then the seller should answer “unknown.” The seller’s attorney should also point out to the seller that if the seller had inspections conducted when the seller purchased the home, any information contained in the inspection reports may be information that is within seller’s actual knowledge (which the seller may have simply forgotten) and subject to disclosure. Therefore, a seller needs to be careful so as not to provide an answer to a question in the PCDS that may be false or misleading as liability may arise.</p><p><em>The Role of the Purchaser’s Attorney</em></p><p>The purchaser’s attorney also needs to advise the purchaser-client as to the importance of the PCDS and the importance of receiving it in advance. Some seller attorneys are already advising their seller-clients not to deliver the PCDS and the purchaser’s attorney must recommend that purchaser demand that the PCDS be delivered before proceeding. Unfortunately, the purchaser may not want to risk losing the home and may agree to proceed without receiving the PCDS.</p><p>Additionally, since the enactment of changes to the PCDS, there have been a myriad of provisions included in riders to the contract of sale (e.g., provisions requiring purchasers to waive certain rights under the PCDS or waiving the provision entirely, provisions reducing statute of limitations periods, damages and more). Again, purchasers and purchasers’ attorneys need to push back as much as possible (which, many times, is easier said than done).</p><h3 id="its-still-early-only-time-will-tell"><strong>It's Still Early; Only Time Will Tell</strong></h3><p>It is almost three months since the amendments to the PCDA went into effect, and like the original passage of the PCDA in 2002, there is much controversy and unclarity with the new amendments. Real estate practitioners are trying to work through all of it and make the transition as smooth as possible for both buyers and sellers. As the renowned real estate attorney, Professor Karl Holtzschue, has said, the PCDA leaves us with more questions than answers. Only time will tell how it all will work out, but if the downstate practitioners can take something away from the experiences of the upstate practitioners, it may not all be as dire as we think.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[The big winner in terms of property value was Manhattan’s District 10, coming in with $1.182 million for the median property value.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—According to the National Association of Realtors, Congressional District 17, covering northern Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, and southern Dutchess counties, recorded the highest rate of homeownership in the New York Metro Area at 76.6% at the end of 2022. U.S. Congressman Michael Lawler (R) represents the district.</p><p>District 18, covering Orange and northern Dutchess counties, was a close second with 67% home ownership, followed by District 16—southern Westchester and the Northern Bronx—at 55.6%. U.S. Congressman Pat Ryan (D) and U.S. Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D) represent those districts, respectively. District 10, represented by U.S. Congressman Daniel Goldman (D), showed 28.8% homeownership in Manhattan, while District 15, covering the northern Bronx, reported just 17.1% homeownership. U.S. Congressman Richie Torres (D) represents that district. The lowest homeownership was in the southern Bronx and northern Manhattan, with just 11.7% of the population owning homes. The district is represented by U.S. Congressman Adriano Espaillat (D).</p><p>The big winner in terms of property value was Manhattan’s District 10, coming in with $1.182 million for the median property value. District 16 took second place with a median property value of $634,900, followed by District 13, with $593,700 as its median property value. The northern suburbs of District 17’s median property value was $549,400, while District 16 reported $489,500. District 18 came in with the lowest median property value at $365,300. Still, median property values in all these districts skewed higher than the national median property value of $320,900.</p><p>“The data in these reports reflects the fact that the Hudson Valley and New York Metro Area continue to be one of the most desirable locations in the country,” said Lynda Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer of the White Plains-based Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. “Our association joins NAR in its quest to advocate for current homeowners, as well as support potential homeowners in the goal of achieving the American dream.”</p><p>June is National Homeownership Month, which is designed to raise awareness about the benefits of owning a home and the importance of making homeownership more attainable for all Americans.</p><p>In terms of median household income, District 17 took the lead at $115,661, followed closely by District 10 with $103,988. District 16 reported a household income of $96,051 and District 18, $87,124. Districts 13 and 15 held the lowest household incomes with $47,855 and $42,090, respectively. Only those two districts fell below the national median household income of $74,755.</p><p>Overall, in New York, the real estate industry accounted for $366.6 billion or 17% of the gross state product in 2023. Nationwide, however, the U.S. is facing an underbuilding gap of 5.5 million units, equating to a $4.4 trillion underinvestment in housing. Still, NAR is forging ahead to help Americans achieve home ownership by advocating for various bipartisan tax bills and solutions including the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (S. 1557/H.R. 3238), to encourage creating and preserving affordable housing, and incentivizing home ownership by increasing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and eliminating the marriage penalty.</p><p>HGAR Realtors work with elected officials at the national, state and local levels to enact legislation that supports existing homeowners and helps to create opportunities for future homeowners. In the US Congress, HGAR supports bills like the “More Homes on the Market Act,” which would increase the capital gains exemption for long-time homeowners; encouraging them to bring their homes to market and increase inventory for new homeowners.</p><p>In Albany, we support the “First-Time Homebuyers Savings Account;” similar to the NYS 529 for Education, which would, if enacted, allow future homebuyers to put aside money, tax free, to be used as a downpayment on a home. Within its counties, HGAR has successfully helped pass laws affecting the co-op purchase process; making the transaction more transparent for all parties and allowing for more successful sales; frequently to first-time homebuyers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[A significant portion of our end-of-session efforts was focused on opposing legislative proposals that would have negatively impacted New York’s real estate sector.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the New York State Legislature wrapped up the 2024 Legislative Session. With Good Cause Eviction, maybe, being implemented across the state and a budget that was, barely, late, the Senators and Assemblymembers are ditching their trips to Albany for time in their districts, focused on their re-elections. This is all to say that the final stretch to November has started.</p><p>Along with the President, each state representative is up for re-election this year and will be on your ballot in November. So, keeping this in mind, let’s see what our state representation as a whole did on some of our issues.</p><p>A significant portion of our end-of-session efforts was focused on opposing legislative proposals that would have negatively impacted New York’s real estate sector. Here are some of the bills our state representatives listed to us and didn't advance:</p><ul>
<li>Legislation to eliminate dual agency in the state (S.9686 and A.9823)</li>
<li>NY HEAT Act, which sought to expand state authority to discontinue natural gas services for homes and businesses (S.2016-B/A.4592-B).</li>
<li>A bill prohibiting landlords from collecting rental broker fees from tenants (S.2783/A.4781).</li>
<li>A requirement for sellers to provide a lead paint hazard test before any real estate transaction or lease (S.2353-A/A.4820-B).</li>
<li>A mandate for real estate licensees to collect and report personal demographic data from clients annually (S.2352/A.10386).</li>
<li>Authorization for any city or town to impose a new real estate transfer tax to fund community housing (S.7589-A/A.7496-A and S.4098-A/A.6257-A).</li>
<li>Proposals to establish new real estate cease and desist zones in parts of New York City (S.7061/A.7527, S.7971/A.9332, A.6252).</li>
<li>The “Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act” (S.221-A/A.3353).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, some notable legislation passed both the Senate and Assembly during the final days of the session:</p><ul>
<li>A state registry and regulations for short-term rentals (S.885-C/A.4130-C).</li>
<li>The Climate Change Superfund Act, requiring certain fossil fuel companies to contribute to a fund for infrastructure addressing climate change issues (S.2129-B/A.3351-B).</li>
</ul>
<p>The fight continues for a few other pieces of legislation that did not pass this year:</p><ul>
<li>Allow telemarketing during states of emergency (S.412/A.6680).</li>
<li>Establish a first-time home savings account program (S.6574/A.6933).</li>
<li>Increase transparency in the cooperative application process (S.2964-A/A.1778-A).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a mixed bag of successes in both defense and offensive advocacy, thus leaving us a lot of follow-up work to do before the next legislative session in 2025. It is worth noting again that Good Cause Eviction did pass during this legislative session but its wider effects of its implementation on a local level have yet to be realized. So, the session might be over, but the ripples continue.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to thank the team at NYSAR and all of you for fighting the good fight with me during this past legislative session. Each year, HGAR builds on the success of last year’s advocacy and this year was no different with record attendance on Lobby Day for both HGAR members and elected officials.</p><p>Although the year was not full of victories, the bills we stopped from advancing, including some more extreme versions of Good Cause Eviction, are worth celebrating. There was a real risk that news of the NAR settlement would darken the perception of our profession in the halls of Albany. This could have resulted in our having experienced a much different legislative reality. It was because of HGAR advocacy and the level of connection with our elected officials that helped maintain the narrative of professionalism that HGAR Realtors exemplify. And it is that professionalism and growing advocacy that will keep us strong going into the 2025 legislative session.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWARK, NJ—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, along with six other Realtor associations, recently held the 3rd Annual Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Summit at the Newark Liberty International Airport Marriott here.</p><p>HGAR teamed up with the National Association of Realtors, the New York State Association of Realtors, the New Jersey Realtors, the North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, the Greater Bergen Association of Realtors and the Greater Rochester Association of Realtors to create the two-day presentation (June 3-4).</p><p>The goal of the DEI Summit was to build curiosity while exploring the understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion within personal and professional careers. It was also designed to help attendees develop the skills needed to be successful and create actionable steps toward impactful change.</p><p>This year’s keynote speaker, Thasunda Brown Duckett, Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People of 2024” and President and CEO of TIAA, shared the stage with Michelle Mills Clement, CEO of Chicago Association of Realtors, where they discussed financial inclusion, retirement, building generational wealth, and importance of financial inclusion.</p><p>Duckett is determined to put more underserved Americans on a path to financial health and resilience. She helped launch Advancing Black Pathways, an initiative to help more Black Americans achieve sustained economic success. She's also striving to help the 40% of all Americans at risk of running out of their retirement savings.</p><p>The first day of the Summit launched with Bias Override, an approved continuing education course to combat bias in the industry led by certified instructor Matt Difanis. The next day included close to 20 speakers and panelists on various topics.</p><p>“With over 200 attendees from several associations mainly from New York and New Jersey, this year's DEI Summit was our best yet,” said Freddimir Garcia, HGAR’s DEI Officer. “It was uplifting and invigorating to hear a strong support of DEI from our keynote speaker, Thasunda Brown Duckett and Michelle Mills Clement, among others.” The topics covered included advocacy, appraisal bias, advancing DEI, and on-the-field challenges with the “-isms.”</p><p>“This powerful and innovative summit is the leading Realtor DEI event in the Northeast,” added HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez. “It engages members of participating Associations while advancing DEI throughout the region’s real estate markets through collaboration and by securing top speakers and industry leaders who address the latest topics and issues impacting DEI."</p><p>A host of HGAR members attended the two-day DEI conference and were pleased with the programs offered and the issues addressed at the event.</p><p>“The DEI conference this year was such a great experience because we talked about real issues to increase knowledge. Knowledgeable realtors close more deals,” said Rey Hollingsworth Falu, Broker/Owner of Hollingsworth Real Estate Group. “DEI isn't about replacing one group with another. It's about preparing ourselves for the markets we are encountering now and in the future. It's about how we can work with one another to level up our business. The networking was great and that means more opportunities to close business with more professionals. The keynote was impactful and could apply to any professional looking to get better at their craft. Diversity is our strength. Equity means everyone has a stake in winning. Inclusion means a rising tide lifts all boats. I'm pumped for next year already.”</p><p>Immediate Past President of HGAR Tony D’Anzica, JD, CIPS, AHWD, Broker-Owner of DynaMax Realty NYC, Inc., said, “I believe we must start moving away from acronyms and start moving toward an environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to participate, lead, and actively contribute to the growth and improvement of our existing institutions.”</p><p>“Thinking/hearing/learning about DEI is never a one-and-done experience,” noted Leah Caro, AHWD, CBR, CIPS, CRB, PSA, President and Principal Broker of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville. “HGAR and the other associations that bring our members the annual DEI Summit know that the exposure to the best DEI speakers and trainers, along with all the right resources will make us not just better Realtors, but better humans.”</p><p>Anthony Domathoti, AHWD, CRS, C2EX, SRS, CIPS, ABR, who is the Broker/Owner of EXIT Realty Premium of the Bronx, related, “The third annual Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Summit in Newark, NJ, was a remarkable success. The event brought together a diverse group of real estate professionals dedicated to advancing DEI within the real estate industry.”</p><p>He noted that the first day of the event featured an insightful session led by Matt Difanis on overcoming biases in fair housing, followed by a vibrant networking reception that allowed attendees to connect and discuss the day's learnings.</p><p>The second day began with empowering welcomes from NJR President Gloria Monks and NYSAR President Joe Rivellino. The day continued with impactful discussions on representation and appraisal biases, featuring experts like Alex Vidal, Troy Singleton, Jillian White, and Alexia Smokler. A highlight was the keynote fireside chat with Thasunda Brown Duckett, President &amp; CEO of TIAA, moderated by Michelle Mills Clement, which delved deep into the role of leadership in fostering diversity and inclusion, Domathoti stated.</p><p>“The summit was an eye-opener, leaving us inspired and equipped with new strategies to drive real change in our professional lives,” Domathoti said. “The event concluded with attendees feeling motivated and ready to implement the new tools and strategies they had gained.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales slightly declined in May as the median sales price climbed to a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the four major U.S. regions, sales slid month-over-month in the South but were unchanged in the Northeast, Midwest and West. Year-over-year, sales rose in the Midwest but receded in the Northeast, South and West.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—retreated 0.7% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million in May. Year-over-year, sales waned 2.8% (down from 4.23 million in May 2023).</p><p>“Eventually, more inventory will help boost home sales and tame home price gains in the upcoming months,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Increased housing supply spells good news for consumers who want to see more properties before making purchasing decisions.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of May was 1.28 million units, up 6.7% from April and 18.5% from one year ago (1.08 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.7-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.5 months in April and 3.1 months in May 2023.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in May was $419,300, the highest price ever recorded and an increase of 5.8% from one year ago ($396,500). All four U.S. regions registered price gains.</p><p>“Home prices reaching new highs are creating a wider divide between those owning properties and those who wish to be first-time buyers,” Yun added. “The mortgage payment for a typical home today is more than double that of homes purchased before 2020. Still, first-time buyers in the market understand the long-term benefits of owning.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 24 days in May, down from 26 days in April, but up from 18 days in May 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 31% of sales in May, down from 33% in April but up from 28% in May 2023. NAR’s 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in May, unchanged from April and 25% higher than one year ago.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in May, identical to April and up from 15% in May 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in May, unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates">Mortgage Rates</h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.87% as of June 20. That’s down from 6.95% the prior week, but up from 6.67% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales">Single-Family and Condo/Co-Op Sales</h3><p>Single-family home sales declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.71 million in May, down 0.8% from 3.74 million in April and 2.1% from the prior year. The median existing single-family home price was $424,500 in May, up 5.7% from May 2023.</p><p>At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 400,000 units in May, existing condominium and co-op sales were unchanged from last month and down 9.1% from one year ago (440,000 units). The median existing condo price was $371,300 in May, up 5.1% from the previous year ($353,300).</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown"><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></h3><p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast in May were identical to April at an annual rate of 480,000, a decline of 4% from May 2023. The median price in the Northeast was $479,200, up 9.2% from the prior year.</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales were unchanged from one month ago at an annual rate of 1 million in May, up 1% from one year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $317,100, up 6.4% from May 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South fell 1.6% from April to an annual rate of 1.87 million in May, down 5.1% from the previous year.

    <description><![CDATA[Only Westchester saw a slight increase in closed sales for single-family homes, with a 4.6% gain.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Median sales prices for single-family homes saw double-digit increases in every county, with the exception of the Bronx, which experienced a slight drop of just 1.6%. Westchester County reached a new high, with a median of $980,000—a 16.3% increase over last year’s median home prices, according to a report released on June 21 by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p><p>Sullivan County posted the highest gain of 27.5% bringing the May median sales price to $347,500, over last year’s price of $272,500.</p><p>Only Westchester saw a slight increase in closed sales for single-family homes, with a 4.6% gain. Sales were down in all other areas with Putnam County’s single-family home sales taking a dip of 29.2%. Closed sales in the condo markets for both the Bronx and Westchester rose by 18.8% and 16.5%, respectively. Westchester’s condo and co-op median prices also increased by about 10%. In Rockland County, the median condo price jumped 49.2% to $472,000, while the Bronx median condo price grew 42% to $350,000.</p><p>Inventory plummeted in all areas except Sullivan County, which experienced a 5.8% increase. The Bronx scored the highest for overall pending sales for all property types with an 18.4% hike. Most of the other areas reported a decline in pending sales.</p><p>The report by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, based on data supplied by OneKey MLS, also indicates a mixed bag of new listings, with Westchester, Putnam and the Bronx declining while, Rockland, Orange and Sullivan new listings were on the rise.</p><p>“Due to strong demand and limited supply, home prices are continuing to rise in our area, ensuring the value of owning property and wealth creation for homeowners in the lower Hudson Valley,” said Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO. “New listings are increasing in half of our region, pointing to more homes coming onto the market, while rising pending sales signal an increase in future closed sales.”</p><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Single-family home sales decreased slightly by 4.3% and the median sales price also dipped slightly by 1.6% to $610,000. Last month, the median was $617,500, and last year at this time, it was $620,000. Condo sales, however, rose by 18.8%, and prices by 42% with a new median of $350,000. This tops last month’s median of $285,000 and last year’s median of $246,500. However, sales in the co-op market saw a 6.8% decline and a 4.9% decrease in median sales price to $215,000. Last May’s median co-op sales price held steady at $226,000.</p><p>New Bronx listings for both condos and co-ops climbed by 26.7% and 15.7% respectively, while listings for single-family homes dropped by 15%. Overall inventory for all three housing types was down significantly, with condos seeing the largest decline at 36.8%. There were 34% fewer single-family homes on the market and 15.9% fewer co-ops. As of May there were six months of supply, down by 21.1% from the previous month. Overall pending sales for all property types were down by 12.8%.</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>For the first time in months, sales of single-family homes increased slightly by 4.6%, and the median sales price advanced by 16.3% to a new high of $980,000. Last year at this time, the median price held at $842,500 and just last month it stood at $870,107.&nbsp; The condo market also experienced a boost in sales at 16.5% and a 9.8% hike in the median sales price to $499,500. Closed sales declined by 4.8% in the co-op market, however, the median sales price grew by 10.1% to $205,000.</p><p>New listings for condos rose by 26.3% but declined by 15.8% for co-ops and 10% for single-family homes. Overall inventory for all property types declined, with co-ops seeing the largest decrease at 33.3%, followed by single-family homes at 21.3%. Months of supply was down 10.7% to just 2.5 months, and pending sales fell by 11.1%.</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Single-family home sales in Putnam County saw a decrease of 29.2% in May but condo sales rose by 62.5%. The median sales prices for single-family homes increased 13.5% to $565,000 – up from $498,000 in May of 2023. Condos also saw a hike in the median sales price by 6.9% to $369,000. No co-op sales were reported in May.</p><p>While Putnam typically has a very limited supply of condos, new listings for condos saw a 650% increase, to 15 condos, up from just two last May. Single-family home listings declined by 14%. Inventory for condos also rose significantly by 150% from six to 15. Months of supply for both property types was up by 3.7%, leaving just 2.8 months. Pending sales declined by 6.3%.</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Rockland’s co-op market, while small, saw the largest drop in closed sales from last year, by 81.8%. This time last May there were 11 closed co-op sales, as opposed to just two this year. Closed sales for condos also declined by 28.9% and 10.4% for single-family homes. Again, co-ops were the big winners when it came to price increases—the market realized a 158.4% gain on median sales prices to $307,500, up from just $119,000 in May of 2023 and $140,000 from last month. Condos saw a 49.2% increase in median sales prices to $472,500, as compared to $316,750 last year.

However, condos saw a 21.4% increase in the median sales price to $312,50—up from $257,500 last year. Single-family homes also got a boost in the median sales price to $442,500, which is 2.9% higher than last year. There was just one co-op sale in May at $140,000, as co-op properties are limited in Orange County.</p><p>New listings for condos rose by 13% and 6% for single-family homes. Inventory dropped by 30.2% for condos and 15.2% for single-family residences. Months of supply increased 3% in May to 3.4 months, but pending sales declined by 7.4%.</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>While Sullivan County’s single-family home sales declined 12.9% in May, the median sales price grew 27.5% to $347,500, over last year’s median of $272,500. There was just one condo sale at $230,000 and no co-op sales during the month.</p><p>New listings for single-family homes advanced by 16.7% and inventory increased by 5.85%. As of May, Sullivan had the largest months of supply in the HGAR region at 6.4 months, an increase of 20.8% as compared to the previous month. Pending sales of single-family homes also increased at a rate of 8.8%.</p><p><em>(EDITOR’S NOTE: Link to ALL regional reports:&nbsp; </em><a href="https://www.hgar.com/resources/market-data"><em>Market Data (hgar.com)</em></a><em>.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WEST NYACK—As part of its ongoing campaign to empower members in its vast geographic footprint, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors held its annual “Rockland County Day” event on June 18 at the Crestview Conference Center here.</p><p>The program offered the latest home sales data and trends for Rockland County provided by HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez; updates on the NAR Commission settlement by HGAR General Counsel and Professional Standards Administrator Brian Levine and perspectives on topical business and political issues by U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-17) and Rockland Business Association President Al Samuels.</p><p>After a short welcome address by HGAR President Carmen Bauman, Fernandez provided the latest sales and price data on the Rockland County home market, including the fact that Rockland County saw an 18.3% decline in sales in May as compared to a year earlier, while the median sale price rose 24.2% during that period to $745,000. In May, the Rockland County home sales market had 2.6 months of supply, down 10.3% from a year earlier. A balanced home sales market has between 6.0 months to 9.0 months of supply. With the limited supply, Fernandez noted that it is currently a sellers’ market.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/06/RC-DAY-GROUP-SHOT-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1599" height="1068" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/RC-DAY-GROUP-SHOT-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/RC-DAY-GROUP-SHOT-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/06/RC-DAY-GROUP-SHOT-1.jpg 1599w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Brian Levine, Esq., HGAR General Counsel; Jennifer Rousset, HGAR Regional Director for Rockland County; Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO; U.S. Congressman Mike Lawler; Carmen Bauman, HGAR President; Al Samuels, Rockland County Business Association President and CEO; and Alex Roithymayr, HGAR Government Affairs Director.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in May slipped 2.1%, according to a report released today (June 27) by the National Association of Realtors. The Midwest and South posted monthly losses in transactions while the Northeast and West recorded small gains. Year-over-year, all U.S. regions registered reductions.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—decreased to 70.8 in May.

    <description><![CDATA[“2023 was a difficult year for Realtors due to high mortgage rates and low housing inventory, which significantly impacted home sales volume,” ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—In 2023, when the volume of existing-home sales hit the lowest level since 1995, 26% of Realtors named lack of inventory and housing affordability as the most important factors limiting potential clients from making a purchase, according to the National Association of Realtors’ 2024 Member Profile. The annual report analyzes members’ business activity and demographics from the prior year.</p><p>“2023 was a difficult year for Realtors due to high mortgage rates and low housing inventory, which significantly impacted home sales volume,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “Realtors faced competition at all angles—not only to represent clients but also to ensure their buyers’ offers were accepted amid tough real estate market conditions.”</p><p>Nearly two out of three Realtors (65%) hold sales agent licenses, while 22% hold broker licenses and 17% hold broker associate licenses. Seventy-four percent of members specialize in residential brokerage. Like 2022, relocation, residential property management and commercial brokerage are members’ most common secondary specialty areas.</p><p>Members typically have 10 years of real estate experience, down from 11 years in 2022. Seventy-three percent of members are very certain they will remain in the real estate industry for at least two more years. Brokerage specialists had a lower sales volume ($2.5 million vs. $3.4 million), and the typical agent had fewer transactions (10 vs. 12) in 2023 compared to 2022.</p><p>The typical Realtor earned 20% of their business from previous clients and customers, down from 27% last year. The most experienced members—those with 16 or more years of experience—reported a greater share of repeat business from clients or referrals (a median of 42% in 2023). Similar to 2022, members with two years of experience or less reported no repeat business in 2023. Overall, Realtors earned a median of 21% of their business from referrals, a decrease from 24% in 2022. Referrals were also more common among members with 16 or more years of experience—a median of 29%—compared to no referrals for those with two years or less of experience.</p><p>The typical property manager managed 31 properties in 2023, down notably from 40 properties in 2022. The typical Realtor worked 35 hours per week in 2023, slightly less than last year.<br><br>The median gross income for Realtors decreased to $55,800 in 2023, down from $56,400 in 2022. Realtors with 16 years or more experience had a median gross income of $92,500, up from $80,700 in 2022. Realtors’ total expenses increased to $8,450 in 2023 from $8,210 in 2022.<br><br>A majority of Realtors (53%) worked with an independent company and 88% were independent contractors at their firms—both figures are nearly identical to 2022. The typical Realtor had a median tenure of five years with their current firm, down from a median of six years in 2022. Eight percent of members reported working for a firm that was bought or merged in the past two years, down from 26% in 2022.<br><br>“Regardless of market conditions, agents who are Realtors sought a career where they could be their own boss as an independent contractor, specialize in residential or commercial brokerage, and embrace new technologies to make transactions happen,” said Lautz.<br><br>Daily, most Realtors use a smartphone with wireless email and internet capability (96%) and a laptop or desktop computer (91%). The smartphone features that members use most frequently daily are e-mail (94%), social media apps (60%) and GPS (56%). Sixty-four percent of Realtors use multiple listings software daily. Text messaging (94%) is the top method of communication for members with their clients, followed by telephone (91%) and e-mail (89%).<br><br>More than two-thirds of members (72%) have their own website—44% of which are provided by the member’s firm. For professional purposes, most members use Facebook (77%), Instagram (57%), and LinkedIn (55%).<br><br>Six percent of Realtors use drones themselves as part of their business, and 46% have hired a professional drone operator. Four percent and 2% of members, respectively, use 3D/virtual tour and virtual staging technology daily.<br><br>Sixty-five percent of all Realtors were female in 2023, an increase from 62% last year. The median age of Realtors was 55, down from 60 last year. Thirty-five percent were 60 years or older and 4% were less than 30.<br><br>Seventy-nine percent of Realtors were White in 2023, down from 81% last year. Hispanics/Latinos accounted for 10% of Realtors, followed by Black/African Americans (6%) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (4%). New members were more diverse than experienced members. Among those who had two years or less of experience, 40% were non-White.</p><p>Realtors’ education level exceeded that of the general public. Ninety-two percent of members had some post-secondary education, with 34% completing a bachelor’s degree as their highest level of education. Seventy percent of members reported volunteering in their community—most commonly among members aged 40 to 49 years.</p><p>“Realtors are hardworking people who advocate for homeownership and property rights in the communities they serve,” said NAR President Kevin Sears, broker-partner of Sears Real Estate/Lamacchia Realty in Springfield, MA. “Regardless of how you find a property, expert agents who are Realtors help take the stress out of the home buying process and navigate the most intricate and significant transaction many will ever complete.”</p><h3 id="survey-methodology">Survey Methodology</h3><p>In March 2024, NAR e-mailed a 98-question survey to a random sample of 157,711 Realtors and received 6,113 responses. The survey had an adjusted response rate of 3.9%. The confidence interval at a 95% level of confidence is +/- 1.25% based on a population of 1.5 million members. The association weighted responses to be representative of state-level NAR membership. Information about compensation, earnings, sales volume and number of transactions are characteristics of calendar year 2023, while all other data are representative of member characteristics in early 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Data shows that from 1996-2021, the Hudson Valley region lost a net total of 146,763 people to out migration, which calculates out to 5% of the Hudson Valley’s population. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWBURGH—Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress issued a scathing report earlier today (July 15) on the high cost of out migration taking place in New York State and the Hudson Valley region, which it said was one of the worst in a quarter century.</p><p>The Newburgh-based non-profit’s report noted that the nine-county Hudson Valley region (Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester counties) lost a net of 12,257 people who moved to other counties or states in 2021. The report stated: “As the pandemic cooled and people tip-toed back toward normality, the Hudson Valley experienced some of its worst population losses due to migration in the past 25 years." The study noted that the 2021 population loss was the largest since 2005, a year that saw thousands move from the Hudson Valley to New York City as part of the post 9-11 return to the New York metropolitan area. Pattern for Progress states that the Hudson Valley lost a net of $1.1 billion in adjusted gross incomes due to outward migration in 2021.</p><p>The report entitled: “Moving In, Moving Out” cited data released by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in late June 2024 that tracked the movement of people from state to state and county to county from 2022 and earlier.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/07/450468334_871704661663123_1041310003241057034_n-3.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="405" height="535"></figure><p>Data shows that from 1996-2021, the Hudson Valley region lost a net total of 146,763 people to out-migration, which calculates out to 5% of the Hudson Valley’s population.</p><p>Statewide, federal data indicated that New York State lost a net of 224,781 people to out-migration in 2021, which represented approximately $14.2 billion in lost adjusted gross income.</p><p>Pattern’s report noted that the period of 2021 and the start of 2022 was a time of transition during the COVID-19 pandemic, where vaccines were being administrated in large numbers and mask mandates were beginning to be lifted, while remote work policies were implemented in large numbers.<br><br>Adam Bosch, president and CEO of Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, tells <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the migration trend of northern parts of the Hudson Valley region gaining in population and the southern section of the region losing residents continues. He added that many new residents of the northern Hudson Valley have incomes that are greater than those that are leaving the Hudson Valley.<br><br>While that may have some beneficial impacts, it will also lead to less police, fire, municipal and construction workers in the Hudson Valley.<br><br>Another troubling trend is that the loss of population in the Hudson Valley has resulted in approximately 45,000 fewer children in the region’s public schools as compared to 2005. In that span of nearly two decades, more than 40 school buildings have closed, the report notes.<br><br>In addition, the outward migration has reduced the size of the area’s workforce and increased the age of the average worker. The older half of the labor pool (45-64) currently outnumbers the younger contingent by almost 100,000 people.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/07/450344706_870506338449622_7129323765453990523_n-1-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="543" height="629"></figure><p>“These workforce and youth trends indicate that our labor pool is likely to shrink by at least 125,000 people in the next 10-20 years, a troubling trend that could be exacerbated if outward migration persists,” the report notes.<br><br>Those demographics have and will likely cause strains in the blue-collar workforce and service industries in the region. Another issue impacting the middle class in the Hudson Valley is the escalating cost of housing.<br><br>“Realtors and banks say that approximately 20% of home purchases in the Hudson Valley during the heart of the pandemic were all-cash transactions,” the Pattern report states. “These trends have broad ramifications. Homeownership is now unaffordable for most Hudson Valley households because prices increased more and faster than wages. That has put additional stress on our limited rental stock.”<br><br>The report continued, “Our inadequate pace of development has not kept up with demand. Migration patterns in the near future could worsen these problems or help to alleviate them.”<br><br>Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress is scheduled to release its analysis of housing affordability entitled “Out of Reach” on Tuesday.

    <description><![CDATA[“The struggle to create housing that is affordable for people across the entire spectrum of income will be the defining civic issue for this generation of leaders in the Hudson Valley,” Pattern CEO Adam Bosch said.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWBURGH—Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress followed up its analysis on the high cost of <a href="https://realestateindepth.com/out-migration-has-a-heavy-cost-for-ny-state-and-hudson-valley/" rel="noreferrer">migration out of the Hudson Valley</a> released yesterday, with a troubling report issued earlier today (July 16) appropriately titled “Out of Reach 2024,” which focuses on the rental and purchase housing markets in the Hudson Valley.</p><p>The Center for Housing Solutions at Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress report illustrates the steep rise in housing costs over the past year, as surging rents and stagnant wages worsened the strain on tenants throughout the entire region. While a significant part of the report highlighted the sizable gap between wages and median rents, the term “Out of Reach” definitely applies to the purchase home segment as well.</p><p>In terms of the for-sale market, the available housing is out-of-reach for many prospective homebuyers While housing stress is most acute for those who earn the least amount of money in our economy, the latest data show that even the core of our middle class in the Hudson Valley is now struggling to find an affordable place to live, Pattern officials stated.</p><p>The report noted that “The majority of households in the Hudson Valley cannot qualify for enough mortgage (funding) to purchase the median-priced home in any of our nine counties. This is true for one-person, two-person, and four-person households making median wages in each county.”</p><p>Data indicates that a two-person household falls anywhere from $99,665 (Sullivan) to $280,410 (Rockland) short of qualifying for enough mortgage to buy the typical home in each county. Consequently, data show that more middle-class households are leaving the region in search of more affordable options in our neighboring states, or in Southern states such as Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p><p>The purchase gap to qualify for a mortgage for the median-priced single-family home for a two-person household in addition to the aforementioned counties was:<br><br>Columbia County (AMI: $85,120), purchase mortgage gap: $215,876<br>Dutchess County (AMI $91,840), purchase mortgage gap: $153,024<br>Greene County (AMI: $77,280), purchase mortgage gap: $118,436<br>Orange County (AMI: $91,840), purchase mortgage gap: $143,624<br>Putnam County (AMI: $78,080), purchase mortgage gap: $251,730<br>Ulster County (AMI: $93,760), purchase mortgage gap: $131,710<br>Westchester County (AMI: $124,960), purchase mortgage gap: $249,470<br><br>“The struggle to create housing that is affordable for people across the entire spectrum of income will be the defining civic issue for this generation of leaders in the Hudson Valley,” Pattern CEO Adam Bosch said. “There is ample evidence that the housing crisis is exacerbating our regional workforce shortage, as more people pack up and leave the Hudson Valley in search of a more affordable standard of living elsewhere. We cannot look away from this challenge. To preserve our wellbeing and quality of life, the Hudson Valley must allow and encourage more housing, rather than opposing and protesting it.”<br><br>A single worker making average wages cannot afford fair-market rent in any of the nine counties served by Pattern. The gap between tenant wages and fair-market rent grew substantially in every county except one, as rents increased by more than $200 per month in many places over the past year.<br><br>Other notable conclusions from the report include the following:</p><ul>
<li>Single adults working 40 hours per week on average wages cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in any of the nine counties. Tenants’ hourly wages would need to increase between $2.50 and $31.67 to afford fair-market rents in their respective counties.</li>
<li>Fair-market rents would need to decline anywhere from $130 to $1,647 per month to make them affordable for a person earning average renter wages across the region.</li>
<li>The gap between wages and rent has gotten larger in every county except Greene. In recent years, rent increases have outpaced wage increases by about double. However, this comparative rate of change increased significantly over the past year. For example, average tenant wages in Dutchess, Orange and Ulster counties remained nearly flat while fair-market rents in those counties increased by approximately 15%. The biggest gap was in Westchester County, where average tenant wages dropped by 9% and fair-market rents increased by 16%.</li>
<li>The outlook also worsened for people seeking a two-bedroom apartment. For households that include two earners making average wages, rent remains unaffordable in Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Ulster counties. The positive margins are fairly small in the remaining five counties.</li>
<li>Wages earned by a typical renter ranged from 34% to 51% of the area median income in each county, a key metric for housing policies and programs. In 2023, average renters earned 39% to 61% of the area median income. This change underscores that greater wage growth is happening in the higher income brackets, while renter wages remain stagnant.</li>

<p>The data in Out of Reach indicate that renters and homeowners in the Hudson Valley have little to spend on necessary and discretionary expenses because the cost of housing is gobbling up a large proportion of their incomes. Recent research by Pattern also found that an influx of wealthy households into the region during the pandemic caused very fast gentrification in certain counties, exacerbating the housing stress that already existed. For example, households that moved into Columbia County during the brunt of the pandemic brought an average adjusted gross income of approximately $160,000, while those who left the county earned an average of just under $70,000.</p><p>This same trend occurred at different scales in Dutchess, Greene, Sullivan and Ulster counties. The influx of new wealth pushed up the cost of all types of housing—along with the assessed values of land and homes – making it less viable for low-and moderate-income people to move or buy a home in the region.</p><p>The affordability crisis in housing has also exacerbated a workforce shortage in the Hudson Valley, as working-class families move out of the region and have fewer children. The latest migration data from the Internal Revenue Service found that the Hudson Valley lost a net of 12,257 people in 2021, the largest net out-migration since 2005. The region has lost more people than it gained to migration for 25 of the past 26 years – a trend that has resulted in a net loss of 146,763 people, according to federal data. In 2022-2023, there were 47,865 fewer students attending public school in the Hudson Valley than at the peak of enrollment in 2003.</p><p>Pattern officials also noted that data on migration and school enrollment indicate that the workforce in the region is likely to continue shrinking over the next decade, especially as the Baby Boomer generation retires in greater numbers. These challenging trends are connected to and partially caused by, the forces of stagnant wages and higher housing costs that are underscored in the Out of Reach 2024 report.<br><br>The Out of Reach 2024 report utilized county-by-county data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which examines hourly wages and fair-market rents to analyze the affordability of rental housing. (Fair-market rent is the 40th percentile of renters who have moved within the past two years, which means it is lower than median market-rate rents.) Affordability is calculated by the standard that no individual or family should spend more than 30 percent of its total monthly income on housing.<br><br>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors is one of a host of supporters of the Center for Housing Solutions.<br><br>To read the full Out of Reach report go to: <a href="https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/outofreach2024/">https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/outofreach2024/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
