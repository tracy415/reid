    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—With the specter of a $6-billion shortfall facing New York State this legislative session, Gov. Andrew Cuomo delivered his 10th State of the State Address on Jan. 8 that featured a host of new initiatives, including a $3-billion environmental bond act to fight climate change, a renewed call for legalized cannabis, as well as infrastructure and economic development investments including a new Empire Station Complex and a reimagined Erie Canal.</p>
<p>The governor&#8217;s agenda also includes plans to expand the free college tuition program, offer protections for gig economy workers, paid sick leave and tax cuts for middle class New Yorkers and small businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ship of state is stronger than it has been in decades, but the ocean we navigate is as tempest tossed as we have seen. Waves of anxiety, injustice and frustration are being fanned by winds of anger and division, creating a political and social superstorm, but these are the times when New York is called upon to show leadership and set a course for a troubled nation,&#8221; Gov. Cuomo said.</p>
<p>Among the numerous proposals detailed in the State of the State message, the governor touted his proposed $3 Billion “Restore Mother Nature” Bond Act, which the governor termed as the nation&#8217;s most aggressive program for habitat restoration and flood reduction that will be funded in part by the bond act.</p>
<p>The governor is proposing legalizing cannabis, creating a new Office of Cannabis Management to oversee the medical, adult-use and hemp programs. The proposal limits the sale of cannabis products to adults 21 and over and establishes stringent quality and safety controls including oversight over the packaging, labeling, advertising and testing of all cannabis products. These efforts will be done in coordination with the neighboring states of Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The governor will also propose creating a first of its kind Global Cannabis and Hemp Center for Science, Research and Education with SUNY and other partners.</p>
<p>Other real estate/economic development/business proposals offered by the governor include reducing the corporate tax rate for small businesses from 6.5% to 4%; tripling the current income exclusion for farmers and sole proprietors; making the investment tax credit refundable for farmers; and repealing the penalty on S corporations for underpayment of estimated taxes.</p>
<p>Another initiative calls for the continuation of a multi-year effort to lower Personal Income Tax rates for middle-class New Yorkers. In 2020, the third year of the multi-year tax cuts enacted in 2016, income tax rates have been lowered from 6.85% to 6.09% for taxpayers in the $40,000-$150,000 income bracket, and to 6.1% in the $150,000-$300,000 income bracket. These cuts are expected to save New Yorkers over $1.8 billion this year. Furthermore, income tax rates will continue to drop to 5.5% for taxpayers in the $26,000 to $150,000 tax bracket and 6% in the $150,000-$300,000 bracket. When the cuts are fully phased in, middle class taxpayers will have received an income tax rate cut up to 20%, amounting to a projected $4.2 billion in annual savings for six million filers by 2025.</p>
<p>Two other significant proposals involve expanded efforts to improve Penn Station and upgrade the Erie Canal.</p>
<p>The governor has proposed to redevelop the full city block south of Penn Station to add rail capacity. The expansion would increase overall track capacity by nearly 40% by adding at least eight new tracks to the existing 21 tracks, dramatically increase passenger terminal capacity, ease congestion with widened sidewalks and prominent subway entrances and add new development opportunities on adjoining parcels that will transform the area. As part of this plan, the governor further proposes to explore acquiring the Madison Square Garden Theater to create a new 8th Avenue entrance to the existing Penn Station. Together, these actions will combine the Moynihan Train Hall, existing Penn Station and the block south of Penn into an interconnected Empire Station Complex.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo is recommending the New York Power Authority approve a $300-million investment over the next five years at the board&#8217;s January meeting. A $100-million economic development fund will be invested in communities along the Canal and a separate $65-million investment will be devoted to solutions that will help prevent ice jams and related flooding in the Schenectady area. The remaining $135 million of the plan&#8217;s funding will subsequently be allocated to research recommended by the state’s Reimagine Task Force, as well as to solutions related to flood mitigation, invasive species prevention and ecosystem restoration.</p>
<p>Other staples of the governor’s platform in 2020 will be funding for affordable housing and to help stem the increase in homelessness in New York State.</p>
<p>“This year, I will propose that we commit the largest amount of funding in the history of the State of New York to help the homeless and build affordable housing. That is who we are, that is what we believe, that&#8217;s what we stand for. But we will also honor the state&#8217;s constitutional responsibility and demand a higher level of competence and skill and professionalism from local governments because without the right programs, the money will be wasted and the travesty will be continued.”</p>
<p>The Governor is proposing a first-in-the-nation domestic terrorism law to include mass violence motivated by hate, creating a new A-1 class felony punishable by up to life in prison without parole. The governor is also calling for New York schools to add a curriculum that teaches civic values and the state&#8217;s history of diversity and religious freedom. The Battery Park City Authority will develop a plan to expand the Museum of Jewish Heritage on the Holocaust to be a learning destination for school children across the state</p>
<p>The governor in listing some of the major economic development projects underway in the state, mentioned the highly-anticipated LEGOLAND New York project currently under construction that is scheduled to open this spring.</p>
<p>“LEGOLAND coming to the Hudson Valley, 1,300 jobs. I love LEGOLAND. Yes kids, that is your next vacation, we&#8217;re going to LEGOLAND,” the governor said.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Sales of residential real estate in the lower Hudson Valley remained strong in 2019, according to the recently released “<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HGMLS-4th-Qtr-2019-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2019 Annual And 4th Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report—Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange and Sullivan Counties, New Yor</strong>k</a>” by the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service, Inc.</p>
<p>Overall residential sales, which include condominium, co-op and two to four-family homes, saw some slight decreases in the lower Hudson Valley. Rockland County was the exception, experiencing an overall increase of 3.3%. Single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, increased by 5.5% in Rockland for a total of 2,027 sales as compared to 1,921 sales in 2018.</p>
<p>Westchester, the largest county in the region, had a decrease in single-family sales of less than 1%. Single-family sales totaled 5,832 compared with 5,883 in 2018. Interestingly, the median sales price increased .8% to $655,000. The median price in 2018 in Westchester County was $650,000. Orange County single-family sales declined by 4.2%, the first decline in single-family sales since 2011. Concomitantly, prices for a single-family residence in Orange rose 4.8% to $271,000 from $258,600 in 2018.</p>
<p>In Putnam County single-family residential sales rose by less than 1% to 1,048 units as compared to 1,041 units in 2018. The median price of a single-family home in Putnam County at the end of 2019 was $358,500, an increase of 2.4% from 2018. Sullivan County saw a 2.4% decrease in sales with an 11.3% increase in prices to $142,500. It would appear, as has been the unfolding theme for several years, that a dearth of inventory has impeded sales and put upward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>Co-op sales, which tend to represent approximately 20% of the Westchester market, decreased by 6.4% for the year. Nonetheless, prices for co-ops increased by 6.1% over 2018 with a median price of $175,000. Co-ops do not represent a significant portion of the market in the other counties in the region.</p>
<p>Sales of condominiums presented a mixed picture with sales in Westchester up 1.9%, down in Putnam 10.6%, down in Rockland 7.2% and up in Orange by 4.9%. Sales prices however were up in all but Putnam where prices declined by 1.8%.</p>
<p>Total condo sales for the region were 2,509 units as compared to 2,502 units in 2018 (Westchester-1,335 units, Putnam-126, Rockland-531, Orange-510).</p>
<p>It appears that, to date, federal limitations on state and local property, income and sales tax deductions (SALT) had limited impact on the lower Hudson Valley real estate market. This may in part be due to the ongoing economic development initiatives in the region. With a very low unemployment rate of 3.4% in November (New York Stat Dept. of Labor) and continuing economic expansion across the region, from a $2 billion NYS investment in infrastructure improvements in the Bronx, continuing bio-tech expansion and new luxury residential rentals in Westchester, LEGOLAND New York (scheduled opening, July 2020) and expansion of Woodbury Commons retail outlets in Orange and tourism development in Sullivan County, the region remains poised to continue to see a robust housing market in 2020.</p>
<p>Adding to optimism for a vibrant market is the enduring low interest rate environment which most economists see continuing into 2020. The one caveat to a continuing healthy market is low inventory, which continues to haunt our entire region.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service, Inc. (HGMLS) is a subsidiary of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. (HGAR). HGMLS&#8217;s principal service area consists of Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange and Sullivan counties. It also provides services to Realtors in Bronx, Dutchess, and Ulster counties. The reported transactions do not include all real estate sales in the area or all sales assisted by the participating offices, but they are fairly reflective of general market activity. HGMLS does not provide data on sub-county areas but persons desiring such data are invited to contact Realtor offices in the desired areas. Prior reports back to 1981 as well as current market information and a directory of Realtor members are available on the Association&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.hgar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.hgar.com</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—For the approximately 150 real estate and building executives assembled at the Building Owners and Managers Association luncheon on Jan. 9, many are now hoping that Westchester developer Robert Weisz is as wise a prognosticator as he has been a real estate investor.</p>
<p>Weisz, a principal of RPW Group of Rye Brook, near the close of the roundtable discussion where he served as the moderator, offered the following prediction for the Westchester economy: “I predict that the next five to 10 years are going to be the most successful period that Westchester has seen probably in the last 50 years.” He continued, “Everything is going in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Weisz noted that there is less office inventory due to obsolete older buildings being redeveloped, while at the same time the residential market in the county is booming.</p>
<p>With those market forces in place, he noted, “The talent is moving to Westchester and I think there will be a reversal. In the last 100 years companies were located where the head of the companies lived or where it was more convenient to them. CEOs and chairman, they lived in Connecticut and Westchester, that’s where the companies went. Now that has changed, companies go where talent goes and that talent is moving to Westchester.”</p>
<p>The BOMA session held at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains featured panelists Timothy Jones, CEO of Robert Martin Co. of Elmsford; James Fagan, senior managing director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield; and James J. Houlihan, managing partner, Houlihan-Parnes Realtors, LLC of White Plains.</p>
<p>The panel was mostly upbeat about the office, industrial and flex markets and the prospects for the burgeoning biotechnology industry in Westchester County in the years to come.</p>
<p>Houlihan said the commercial real estate finance market is strong with plenty of available credit at continued historic low rates.</p>
<p>He added that at the present time there are not enough deals for the amount of credit available. “It is certainly a good time to be a borrower,” Houlihan said.</p>
<p>However, Houlihan did level some harsh criticism on the political leadership in Albany and New York City. He specifically pointed at the rent reform legislation passed by the New York State Legislature and signed by Gov. Cuomo, which he termed as a “game changer” for the multifamily investment sector in the New York metro region.</p>
<p>Houlihan estimated that the value of rent-regulated multifamily properties likely decreased by 25% once the rent reform legislation went into law.</p>
<p>Fagan said there has been a significant change in office market utilization, noting that five to 10 years ago, a 10,000-square-foot requirement would house approximately 40 workers. Today, that same 10,000-square-foot tenant will house upwards of 65 workers.</p>
<p>“What they (tenants) are looking for is an experiential fit as opposed to a market fit,” Fagan said. He explained that companies are now looking to locate at properties where a host of amenities, including fitness, and dining options, are available.</p>
<p>Fagan and Jones agreed that while commercial brokers and investors in Westchester and Fairfield counties are hopeful that Millennials will eventually look to the suburbs to raise their families, which will in turn cause companies to shift operations out of New York City, the suburbs must offer more affordable housing options to these young professionals to succeed.</p>
<p>“If we don’t create housing for these folks as they come out of these super-urban environments, they are going to go someplace else,” Fagan said, noting that due to the high cost of living and operating in the New York metro region, many companies and workers are flocking to other less expensive markets in the Southeast and Southwest for example.</p>
<p>Fagan noted that while markets such as Austin have seen their workforce numbers skyrocket in the last three decades, employment in Connecticut and Westchester has lagged.</p>
<p>“If we don’t do something to attract the largest generation as they start their family formations, good luck,” Fagan warned.</p>
<p>He said that the office market in New York City is booming and filling up and the opportunity is there for the suburbs to take advantage. However, the amount of growth will depend on whether the county can provide suitable office and housing options to the companies and its workers.</p>
<p>Robert Martin Co’s Jones, who discussed the strong industrial market and the company’s recent launch of a biotechnology division (RMCBIO1) under the leadership of Lawrence Gottlieb, also indicated the issue of affordable housing in both the rental and purchase markets could factor into the health of the suburban economy in the years ahead.</p>
<p>“We have to figure out a way to provide affordable housing for the people who are leaving the apartments,” he noted.</p>
<p>Jones noted that the housing market is booming in Charlotte, NC where Robert Martin owns Dunkin Donuts retail stores. He said that workers are opting for longer commutes in order to buy a single-family home in the Charlotte region for $275,000.</p>
<p>He added that Westchester County needs to not only do a better job of attracting Millennials, but also retaining talented empty nesters.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors will hold its Annual <a href="https://www.hgar.com/event/cid-roundtable-2020-forecast-20200124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercial Real Estate Roundtable program on Friday, Jan. 24th</a> at the HGAR offices in White Plains beginning at 8:30 a.m. Roundtable participants were being finalized at press time.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I got a call yesterday. It’s the type of call I get regularly. The call usually goes something like this: “If a listing is “off market” on the MLS, this means that I can reach out to the homeowner and attempt to list the property, right? My answer: “Well… not really. It depends.” There was confusion on the other end and I had to explain the possible scenarios and the impact of what the agent does/does not do next. Seeing that I get this type of call often, I thought I would take the time to discuss it here and, hopefully, assist everyone in gaining a better understanding of what it means when you see a listing either “temporarily off market,” “off market” or “canceled” in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Categories</strong></p>
<p>Our current MLS has many listing categories. There’s “active,” “contract,” “temporarily off market,” “off market” and “expired.” With the eventual launch of One Key MLS, the term “contract” will change to “pending” and a new term, “canceled” will be introduced. So, what do they all mean?</p>
<p><strong>Active</strong></p>
<p>“Active” simply means that the listing is readily available to be shown. An “active” listing must be made reasonably available to any licensee who wishes to see it (Realtors have a duty of cooperation with other Realtors). Failure to do so can run a Realtor afoul of the Code of Ethics, as well as possible Department of State licensing law. A Realtor interested in the property must communicate with the listing Realtor regarding all matters concerning the property and they cannot communicate with the homeowner directly.</p>
<p><strong>Contract</strong></p>
<p>“Contract” simply means that the listing is currently under contract to be sold. Both the homeowner and the buyer have mutually agreed to enter into a bilateral, executory, contract for the sale of the property. It does not mean that the house is sold… yet. Any Realtor still desiring to see the property must still be able to see it (similar to Active) and, pursuant to our Code of Ethics, any offer made on the property must be conveyed to the homeowner through the listing Realtor, unless a written waiver is signed by the homeowner (and this should be presented to the Realtor making the offer). All offers must be presented, or a waiver provided, up until the transaction closes. With the new One Key MLS, the term “contract” will no longer exist and the new term “pending” will appear instead.</p>
<p><strong>Temporarily Off Market and Off Market</strong></p>
<p>“Temporarily off market” (TOM) and “off market” (OM) are similar, but they have slightly different meanings. TOM means the property is currently off the market and not available to be shown. No one can see it until the listing once again becomes “active.” The understanding with a TOM listing is that it will eventually come back onto the market in “active” status. If an agent is curious about a TOM listing, he or she must contact the listing Realtor agent, NOT THE HOMEOWNER. This is because the underlying listing agreement may still be in effect.</p>
<p>OM is similar to TOM, but the understanding is the listing will never come back onto the market. This could be for various reasons, but the understanding is the listing will never become “active” again during the course of the underlying listing agreement. Again, like TOM, under OM, the property cannot be shown. And again, if an agent is curious about the property, he or she must contact the listing Realtor agent, NOT THE HOMEOWNER. Again, this is because the underlying listing agreement may still be in effect.</p>
<p><strong>What About the New ‘Canceled’ Category</strong></p>
<p>The new category of “canceled” that will be added to the One Key MLS will mean that the homeowner has decided to no longer work with their current Realtor broker and they are demanding that the Realtor broker make the listing inactive. Canceled will be that designation instead of TOM or OM. However, it is important to note that simply because the homeowner no longer wishes to work with the listing Realtor broker, it does not mean that the underlying listing agreement, which is a bilateral contract, has been terminated. Therefore, the inquiring Realtor MUST NOT CONTACT THE HOMEOWNER, but instead should direct all his/her inquiries concerning the status of the underlying agreement to the listing Realtor.</p>
<p><strong>Expired</strong></p>
<p>This category refers to properties previously listed on the MLS whose underlying listing agreements have reached the date of their termination as identified on the listing agreement; the contract has expired. These listings were not sold and they are currently in limbo. It is unclear if the homeowner wants to relist the property or not, and if they are looking to relist, it may not be with their prior Realtor broker. A Realtor is FREE TO REACH OUT TO THE HOMEOWNER (barring any Do Not Call/Do Not Knock prohibition) to see if they are interested in relisting their property with them.</p>
<p><strong>Big Trouble, Confusion Over TOM, OM, </strong><strong>‘Canceled,&#8217; Underlying Listing Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Realtors run into trouble, either with the DOS, HGAR or both, when they make a very simple assumption. That assumption is that if a listing is TOM, OM, or “canceled” it’s the same as being “expired.” That is not true! Simply because a listing in not available to show does not mean that the underlying agreement between the homeowner and the agent has been terminated. It may very well be in full force and effect. A Realtor agent simply does not know.</p>
<p>Because there may still be an underlying listing agreement, a prospective Realtor agent MUST contact the listing Realtor agent to make any inquiry regarding the listing (whether it’s available to list or if they have an interested buyer for the property). Failure to do so can run the Realtor up against possible interference with contracts and/or violation of Article 16 of the Code of Ethics, as there may be a perfectly valid contract between the homeowner and the listing Realtor broker. Remember, only when a listing is “expired” (or the property is not listed, or the homeowner reaches out to the agent directly) can a Realtor discuss with the homeowner any specifics regarding the listing.</p>
<p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>
<p>First, if you ever see a TOM, OM, or “canceled” you should assume that there is an underlying listing agreement and reach out to the listing agent to inquire into the status of the underlying agreement. If you learn that the underlying agreement is being enforced, then you cannot relist the property and any buyer interest in the property must be directed to and through the listing Realtor agent. If you learn that there has been a full release from the underlying agreement between the homeowner and the listing Realtor broker, you may then reach out to the homeowner to discuss the property.</p>
<p>Second, if you learn that the underlying listing agreement has been terminated, you MUST obtain a copy of the written release/termination (signed by both parties) BEFORE you engage the homeowner concerning the property. A verbal agreement will not satisfy the Statute of Frauds (remember that rule?) and you will have no proof that the previous underlying contract was terminated; meaning that the prior Realtor broker could come back and assert a claim on the commission and/or bring an action for interference of contracts/Article 16 violation. Further, there may be a “carve out” or “accord and satisfaction,” which would mean that although the underlying contract was terminated, there is a new agreement in its stead. This new agreement, although releasing the homeowner from the prior contract, may place a restriction on the collection of commission from certain buyers who previously saw the property, previously made offers, or many other possible restrictions. As the new listing Realtor broker, you’ll need to know those details.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is important to remember that a homeowner has the absolute right to choose his/her representation and a listing Realtor broker cannot prevent the homeowner from canceling such representation. However, simply because a homeowner no longer wishes to be represented by a particular Realtor broker, that does not mean that the Realtor broker has released the homeowner from the underlying contractual obligation. That underlying contract may remain in force for weeks, months or longer. If a Realtor assumes that the underlying contract has expired, simply because they saw the listing as TOM, OM or “canceled” and relists the property, they may also place their new client homeowner in a very bad situation, which could include breach of contract litigation and the possible result of being required to pay two commissions. Further, relisting the property that already has an underlying contract could expose the listing Realtor broker and agent to possible violation of Article 16, but also the added violation of Article 1 (not acting in the client’s best interest).</p>
<p>In the end, it’s best to be fully transparent, and just make all your inquiries relating to a TOM, OM or “canceled” property with the prior listing Realtor broker. You have nothing to lose.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In December, this column focused on the extensive multi-year investigation conducted by <em>Newsday</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/357OA3L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/357OA3L</a>) and the widespread fair housing violations and discrimination taking place on Long Island. The <em>Newsday</em> investigation opened the eyes of the real estate industry to the discrimination that is still taking place many decades after the enactment of the original Fair Housing Act. It is important to realize that Long Island is not the only place where this is occurring. Since the publication of the <em>Newsday</em> article, there have been numerous important developments occurring on local, state and national levels as well as extensive media coverage, all worth noting. It is clear that 2020 will be a critical year and an important step in the advancement of fair housing and the elimination of discrimination in the real estate industry.</p>
<p><strong>National Developments: NAR and HUD</strong></p>
<p>On Jan. 8, the Leadership Team of the National Association of Realtors unanimously passed its “Fair Housing Plan” known as “ACT” (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2RiZKwB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2RiZKwB</a>). NAR’s Fair Housing Plan “emphasizes (A)ccountability, (C)ulture Change, and (T)raining in order to ensure America’s 1.4 million Realtors are doing everything possible to protect housing rights in America.” NAR’s plan specifically makes a commitment that it will undertake to do the following:</p>
<p>• “Work closely with State Association Executives to ensure that state licensing laws include effective fair-housing training requirements and hold real estate agents accountable to their fair housing obligations.</p>
<p>• Launch a Public-Service Announcement Campaign that reaffirm[s] NAR’s commitment to fair housing, and [outlines] how consumers can report problems.</p>
<p>• Integrate fair housing into all Realtor conferences and engagements (to include a fair housing theme throughout the May Midyear Meeting).</p>
<p>• Explore the creation of a voluntary self-testing program, in partnership with a fair housing organization, as a resource for brokers and others who want confidential reports on agent practices so they can address problems.</p>
<p>• Create more robust fair housing education, including unconscious-bias training, and education on how the actions of Realtor(s) shape communities.</p>
<p>• Conduct a national study to determine what factors motivate discrimination in sales market[s].</p>
<p>• Profile leaders who exemplify the best fair housing practices and workplace diversity.</p>
<p>• Develop materials to help Realtors provide consumers with information on schools that avoids fair housing pitfalls.”</p>
<p>That same day NAR also met with Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) Secretary Ben Carson, who agreed to “…join NAR in a joint public service campaign to advance our shared fair housing goals.” NAR, in renewing and reinforcing its commitment to fair housing and elimination of discrimination in the real estate and housing industry, stated that NAR’s “…Code of Ethics and its adherence to fair housing are the cornerstones of our commitment as Realtors. With this new plan, we will see more robust education focusing on core fair housing criteria, unconscious bias, and how the actions of our members impact communities. A partnership with government officials and fair housing advocates will allow us to further promote equality as we continue to work to diversify our industry.” (See <a href="https://bit.ly/384GDNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/384GDNG</a>).</p>
<p>Partnerships and collaborative efforts between each and every organization, Realtor association, governmental agency or legislature and the like involved in the real estate industry are critical if discriminatory behavior is going to be eliminated once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing Initiatives and Developments at the State Level</strong></p>
<p>On Dec. 16th, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced new regulations were approved by the New York State Real Estate Board (see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2tXJIQU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2tXJIQU</a>). These regulations were directly prompted by the Newsday article and will “…mandate enhanced disclosures by real estate professionals to help ensure prospective home buyers, renters, sellers and landlords receive ample information about their rights and protections under New York State law.” Gov. Cuomo stressed that “Housing discrimination is completely unacceptable and it&#8217;s also against the law. New York State is taking immediate action to help ensure renters and homeowners are protected from any and all discriminatory actions when it comes to safe, accessible housing.”</p>
<p>The new regulations impose the following requirements on licensed real estate brokers and salespersons:</p>
<p><strong>• “Notification of Fair Housing laws—</strong>Real estate brokers will be responsible for ensuring that each licensed professional working under their supervision provides a disclosure on fair housing and the New York State Human Rights Law to prospective home buyers, renters, sellers, and landlords. The disclosure, to be furnished by the Department of State, must be given to the prospective party via e-mail, text, facsimile, hardcopy, or other electronic messaging service. The disclosure must also be available at every open house or real estate showing conducted by a real estate professional.</p>
<p><strong>• Posting of Fair Housing laws—</strong>Real estate brokers must display and maintain at every office and branch a notice highlighting the Human Rights law&#8217;s protections regarding housing accommodations and how consumers can file complaints. The notice must be visible from the sidewalk or another conspicuous place. The notice must also be prominently displayed on all websites created and maintained by real estate brokers, real estate salespersons and real estate teams. This notice must also be posted at every open house conducted by a real estate professional.</p>
<p><strong>• Video recording and record preservation—</strong>Every entity approved to provide instruction pertaining to fair housing and/or discrimination in the sale or rental of real property or an interest in real property, must record video and audio of the instruction for every course in its entirety. The approved entity is required to keep the recording for one year following the date the course was delivered.”</p>
<p>As I pointed out in my December article (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2RlfcZl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2RlfcZl</a>), the above regulations focus on a key principle, which is also contained in NAR’s Fair Housing Declaration (see <a href="https://bit.ly/348ye9y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/348ye9y</a>), and which is the disclosure by all Realtors and real estate professionals to consumers “…about their rights and responsibilities under the fair housing laws by providing brochures and other information.” Focusing on this one basic principle and providing the consumer with important information relating to fair housing issues and related concerns will certainly help to reduce the likelihood of discriminatory behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing Plan Unveiled by NYC</strong></p>
<p>On Jan. 7, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio released a draft version of a fair housing plan entitled “<em>Where We Live NYC Draft Plan</em>” (see <a href="https://bit.ly/30md0EO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/30md0EO</a>). The draft plan will be open to the public for additional comment until March 7, 2020. All comments will be published in the final version of the <em>Where We Live NYC</em> plan. The <em>Where We Live NYC</em> plan focuses on six specific goals (see<a href="https://bit.ly/387MC4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/387MC4g</a>):</p>
<p>• Combat persistent, complex discrimination with expanded resources and protections.</p>
<p>• Facilitate equitable housing development in New York City.</p>
<p>• Preserve affordable housing and prevent displacement of long-standing residents.</p>
<p>• Enable more effective use of rental assistance benefits, especially in amenity-rich neighborhoods.</p>
<p>• Create more independent and integrated living options for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>• Make equitable investments to address the neighborhood-based legacy of discrimination, segregation, and concentrated poverty.</p>
<p>An article in <em>The Real Deal</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2TpNtsU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2TpNtsU</a>) reveals that “The city spends less than $100,000 on complaint-based testing, according to Jackie Bray, the director of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants. The new project will have an annual budget of $2 million, with $750,000 dedicated to testing.” Prior to the <em>Newsday</em> article it was clear that the focus on fair housing issues and discrimination was not prioritized by New York City based on the funds expended on testing.</p>
<p>In fact, as revealed in the Newsday article, New York State and Governor Cuomo also failed to live up to the promises made in 2016 that significant expenditures and resources would be allocated to testing and fair housing issues. According to <em>Newsday</em>, “Three years later, Cuomo’s unprecedented drive as governor—now described by his administration as a ‘pilot program’—entailed the expenditure of $65,000 and conducted 88 paired tests of upstate and Westchester-area landlords for discrimination in apartment rentals.” The efforts resulted in “…a $6,000 fine against a landlord charged with refusing to rent to disabled individuals using emotional support animals; a $15,000 settlement by a landlord charged with refusing to rent to black applicants; and a pending court case against a landlord for allegedly refusing to rent to individuals who use service animals.”</p>
<p>It is clear that every organization and governmental agency must dramatically ramp up their efforts in combatting discrimination, educating the public on fair housing issues and discrimination and enforcing existing fair housing laws.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR: Leadership at the Local and Micro Level</strong></p>
<p>In his <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> article entitled “<em>Enough Excuses: It’s Time to Take Bold Action on Fair Housing</em>” (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2RlBR7X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2RlBR7X</a>), Richard Haggerty, CEO of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, stressed that agents need to stop making excuses. He stated, “Enough excuses that these stories are about a few rogue agents and are not representative of the industry as a whole. The <em>Newsday</em> story reflected a pattern of racial steering that was both extensive and pervasive, and I’m sorry to say it could happen anywhere.” Leadership needs to start at the local and micro level—more specifically, at the association, brokerage office level and ultimately, at the individual agent level.</p>
<p>Haggerty stressed, “HGAR needs to do more, and we will do more. HGAR President Ron Garafalo and President-elect Gail Fattizzi have appointed a special Task Force to jump start the association’s efforts to promote and strengthen adherence to Fair Housing Laws. Haggerty stated, “We need new directions and new ideas to bring home the vital importance of fair housing and the irrevocable damage that practices like steering cause in our communities.” On Jan. 7, HGAR conducted a mandatory training session for all instructors of HGAR’s School of Real Estate. These are all important steps in reinforcing knowledge of fair housing laws and issues, but more must be done.</p>
<p>It is also critical that every agent makes sure that fellow agents do not engage in such discriminatory behavior and a certain level of self-policing must also be part of the solution. The level of professionalism must be heightened. Each and every real estate professional must take on a certain responsibility and make it a priority to ensure that the bar is raised for the entire real estate industry.</p>
<p>In 2020 and beyond, the real estate industry must open its eyes and have “2020 vision” with respect to a housing industry without discrimination and it must focus on the advancement of fair housing at all levels.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CHESTER—Orange County Executive Steven Neuhaus told a group of construction and organized labor leaders earlier this month that the county will put out a Request for Proposals for future development at the county-owned former Camp LaGuardia property in Chester and Blooming Grove, NY in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Neuhaus, who appeared at the Jan. 14th meeting of the Hudson Valley Construction Industry Partnership luncheon at Glenmere Mansion in Chester, told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that he remains hopeful that Great Wolf Lodge Resorts Inc. will develop a resort facility in Orange County and possibly on the Camp LaGuardia property.</p>
<p>Back in late August 2018, County Executive Neuhaus reported that the hospitality firm was considering a “handful” of potential sites in Orange County, including the former Camp LaGuardia men’s homeless shelter complex in Blooming Grove and Chester, for a Great Wolf Lodge. The resort was to include a large hotel as well as an expansive indoor and outdoor water park.</p>
<p>However, since then no deal has materialized. County Executive Neuhaus noted that there has been a change in ownership at the company and that he held talks in December and had further discussions again with the new leadership on Jan. 14.</p>
<p>Neuhaus said the company’s new leadership has given Great Wolf “the green light to move forward on projects that were on the (back) burner, including ours.”</p>
<p>He said there are a lot of sites in Orange County that make sense for the company and one in particular that has sparked interest is the former Camp LaGuardia site. Other potential properties that could work for Great Wolf is the Loop project in Newburgh, that had been proposed for a large retail complex a few years ago, as well as the former Nepera Chemical property in Harriman, he noted.</p>
<p>County Executive Neuhaus, who said he would like Great Wolf Lodge to locate at the former Camp LaGuardia site, did tell the newspaper that he is not “married” to the idea that the resort owner develop its project there.</p>
<p>In that vein, he said that Orange County will issue a Request for Proposals for the Camp LaGuardia property in February.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of people who have already contacted me that want to do different uses there,” Neuhaus said. He added that the RFP will be structured in a manner where an investor/developer could select a portion of the property to acquire or could choose to purchase the entire site.</p>
<p>The county’s Department of Public Works did some site clearing and cleanup work at the Camp LaGuardia property in the fall, leaving intact some of the vacant but structurally sound brick buildings.</p>
<p>Orange County took control once again of the nearly 260-acre property in 2016 after a proposal by Scarsdale-based Mountco Construction and Development failed to move forward.</p>
<p>Orange County acquired the property from the City of New York for approximately $8.5 million in 2007. Mountco bested several other bidders for the right to redevelop Camp LaGuardia.</p>
<p>The property was established as a shelter for New York City&#8217;s homeless in 1934, the facility was built in 1918 and served as a correctional facility for women until 1934 when it was transferred to the city&#8217;s Welfare Department and named “Camp Greycourt.” The camp was renamed Camp LaGuardia in 1935. The purpose of the camp was to provide temporary relief for the unemployed. Prior to World War II and through the late 1950s, the camp included a 191-acre farm, which provided food for the residents and to which up to 150 residents were assigned to work. In its heyday, the camp housed more than 1,000 homeless men from New York City.</p>
<p>The closure of Camp LaGuardia was announced in November 2006 by New York City officials as part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s five-year plan to reduce homelessness in New York City.</p>
<p>Great Wolf Resorts, Inc. currently has 18 locations across North America with the closest location being the Great Wolf Lodge Pocono Mountains, which opened in 2005.</p>
<p>If the Great Wolf project moves forward at Camp LaGuardia, the venture would add a third major attraction along Route 17 in Orange County that already features the popular Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley and the $500-million LEGOLAND New York theme park under construction in Goshen. LEGOLAND New York is scheduled to open in July.</p>
<p>Further up Route 17 is the more than $1-billion Resorts World Catskills Casino in Sullivan County and the adjoining Kartrite Hotel &amp; Indoor Water Park.</p>
<p>LEGOLAND New York and Great Wolf have one thing in common—the investment firm Blackstone. In October, an affiliate of Blackstone acquired a 65% controlling interest in Great Wolf Resorts, Inc. As part of the transaction, Blackstone and Great Wolf owner Centerbridge will form a new $2.9-billion joint venture to own the Chicago-based resort firm.</p>
<p>Blackstone was also involved earlier this year in taking Merlin Entertainment, parent company of Lego, private. Lego’s founding family and Blackstone deal to take Merlin private was valued at $7.5 billion, according to published reports.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A continued strong economy with low unemployment and plenty of credit at historically low interest rates, blunted most of the impact of federal tax reform that included a cap on state and local taxes (SALT) in the Hudson Valley region.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HGMLS-4th-Qtr-2019-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourth quarter and full-year market statistics and analysis</a> released recently by the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service, Inc. and various regional residential brokerage firms agree that the 10% SALT cap has impacted sales volume somewhat and the  sale price of higher-priced properties in the region.</p>
<p>Another driver in terms of price appreciation has been the continued low levels of available inventory.</p>
<p>The HGMLS reported that overall home sales (which includes single-family, condominium, co-op and 2-4 family units) rose in Rockland County by 3.3% for the year. However, Rockland was the exception to the rule as Westchester County saw a 1.5% decline in sales in 2019 as compared to the previous year and Putnam registered a 1.1% drop in home sales during that same period.</p>
<p>Orange County in 2019 saw overall sales decline by 2.6%, while Sullivan County suffered a 3.2% overall decline in sales in 2019 as compared to 12 months earlier.</p>
<h4><strong>Hudson Valley Home Sales</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Full-Year 2019 Totals</strong></p>
<p>Rockland County               +3/3%<br />
Putnam County                  -1.1%<br />
Westchester County          -1.5%<br />
Orange County                  -2.6%<br />
Sullivan County                  -3.2%</p>
<p>The median single-family home price was relatively flat in Westchester County for the year, up 0.8% to $655,000. Single-family home sale prices rose 2.4% in 2019 to $358,500 in Putnam County, while Orange County’s median sale price shot up another 4.8% last year to $271,000.</p>
<p>While Rockland was the only county in the HGMLS market area that posted in the black in terms of overall sales, the same could not be said about its median sale price, which fell 1.1% to $455,000 at the close of 2019.</p>
<p>Overall inventory declined in the following markets, exacerbating already tight market conditions: Westchester (-9.1%); Orange (-5.9%) and Sullivan (-12.3%). Inventory in Putnam rose 10.4% year-over-year, while the available for-sale stock in Rockland rose 5.3% in 2019.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, managing partner of Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty, believes the markets would have been even stronger if the SALT Cap was no longer in effect.</p>
<p>“My take on the SALT Cap is that it’s still having an impact on the high end. Basically, the market is in the midst of a strong seller market cycle, but growth is being stifled by weakness in the high end that is largely caused by the SALT Cap,” Rand said. “I really do think that without the SALT Cap, we’d be looking at a significantly higher rate of appreciation throughout the market.”</p>
<p>Noting that the overall Hudson Valley home sales market ended 2019 on a high note with strong sales, Better Homes and Gardens stated in its year-end report on the region that the market is poised for a “relatively robust 2020. Housing fundamentals are all positive: prices are still at attractive levels compared to the last seller’s market, interest rates are back down to historic lows, the economy is solid and inventory might be loosening up.”</p>
<p>The brokerage firm concluded, “Accordingly, we believe that demand will continue to grow and that as the lingering effects of the SALT Cap dissipate, we will see more widespread price appreciation going into the spring market.”</p>
<p>Westchester Real Estate in its Fourth Quarter 2019 Market Report, noted that the region saw strong activity in November and December, after a slow month of activity posted in October.</p>
<p>“Interest rates have played a signiﬁcant role in keeping the real estate market strong these past few years. Despite forecasts of rate increases at the start of 2019, they never materialized, and 30-year ﬁxed-rate loans ended the year still below 4%. Industry experts currently are predicting that rates will remain at similar lows for the balance of 2020, which bodes well for prospective buyers,” Westchester Real Estate stated in the report.</p>
<p>Despite some predictions of an impending recession, the economy is fundamentally strong and consumer confidence remains high. The National Association of Realtors is forecasting that home sales in 2020 should increase approximately 3.4% over 2019 sales levels.</p>
<p>“Predictions are for continued positive price appreciation in the housing market; perhaps lower than in recent years but still in the low single digits. Contrasting the positives, there is still a signiﬁcant amount of global volatility, the Westchester Real Estate report noted. “The U.S. is in an election year, which often has people in a holding pattern until the outcome is determined. Right now, we feel conﬁdent that the positives will outweigh any negatives and the local housing market will continue strong for the coming year.”</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence noted that sales activity picked up in the second half of 2019. In Westchester County, luxury sales ($2 million and higher) dipped by 25% in the first half of 2019, a symptom the brokerage firm’s report blamed on “buyer malaise and concern about tax reform.” Buyers returned to the market after tax returns were filed and the impact of tax reform on their personal balance sheet was clarified. Sales moved into positive territory in the third quarter and momentum continued to build in the fourth quarter. Second half gains offset most of first half declines and luxury sales in 2019 posted a modest decline, Houlihan Lawrence noted in the report.</p>
<p>The ultra-luxury segment of the market ($5 million and higher) was level with 2018, but a sharp drop in selling prices made 2019 look very different from 2018. In 2019 there were no sales over $10 million and the highest sale, originally offered at $12 million, closed at $8.1 million. Most ultra-luxury sales took one or more price reductions and sold on average 26% off the original list price underscoring buyers’ value-driven mentality at the high-end and conservative attitude towards real estate, the brokerage firm stated.</p>
<p>Luxury sales ($1 million and higher) declined in Putnam and Dutchess counties although pending sales in Putnam County increased significantly by year’s end, which Houlihan Lawrence stated was a hopeful sign for 2020.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>SOUTH SALEM—Veteran real estate broker and executive Gail Fattizzi was installed as the 2020 president of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors on Jan. 16 at a gala dinner event held at Le Chateau here.</p>
<p>Fattizzi, who has served for 24 years as the executive director of the independent real estate brokerage network Westchester Real Estate Inc. of Somers, was installed into office by friend and former HGAR President Marcene Hedeyati. Prior to her long-term position with Westchester Real Estate, Fattizzi served as relocation director and advertising manager for Preferred Realty, Inc. for nine years.</p>
<p>The gala event drew approximately 300 HGAR members, Realtor colleagues, real estate and mortgage finance professionals and guests to witness Fattizzi’s installation as HGAR President.</p>
<p>Fattizzi began volunteering about two decades ago at the predecessor Westchester County Board of Realtors, serving first on its Education Council and then as the Chair for the Hope for the Homeless Gala, Communications Council Chair, Education Council Chair, Secretary/Treasurer, Regional Vice President and HG Realtor Foundation Trustee, as well as most recently as HGAR President-elect in 2019.</p>
<div id="attachment_31017" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JVP_0388.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31017" class=" wp-image-31017" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JVP_0388-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-31017" class="wp-caption-text">2019 HGAR President Ron Garafalo</p></div>
<p>In her first speech as the leader of the association, an emotional Fattizzi said she was humbled and honored to take on the post in 2020 along with a talented leadership team of officers and directors. She also thanked Ron Garafalo for his leadership of HGAR in 2019.</p>
<p>She said she plans to embark on a host of initiatives, including implementation of the five-pillars of the new HGAR Strategic Plan and the launch of the HGAR Leadership Accelerator, which will be geared at fostering the talent of the association and identifying the future leaders of the organization.</p>
<p>Fattizzi also plans to revive the Young Professionals Network (YPN), which will be chaired by Richard Herska, and intends to hold some “County Days,” an idea brought to the fore by former HGAR President Katheryn DeClerck, to highlight the unique aspects of the diverse geographic makeup of the association. She added that legislative advocacy both locally, at the state level and in Washington, DC will be very important in 2020.</p>
<p>The new HGAR President stressed that Fair Housing will continue to be a major issue for the association in 2020, noting that HGAR’s Fair Housing Task Force is planning events and training programs to ensure this issue is a staple of the business practices of all HGAR members.</p>
<p>HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty offered welcoming remarks and praised 2019 HGAR President Garafalo and the HGAR Board of Directors for their efforts this past year, which included many initiatives, including a focus on the Code of Ethics and the development of a strategic plan for the association in coming years. At press time, HGAR President Fattizzi and other members of the HGAR 2020 leadership team were holding a session to work on the implementation of the far-reaching HGAR strategic plan at a retreat at the Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz.</p>
<p>Haggerty presided over the installation of 2020 HGAR Board of Directors, while NYSAR President Jennifer Stevenson performed the honors for the 2020 HGAR Executive Officers that include: Crystal Hawkins-Syska, President-elect; Anthony Domathoti, Treasurer; Irene Guanill, Secretary and Ronald Garafalo as Immediate Past Presidents.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Acadia Realty Trust of Rye has closed on the purchase of a retail condo in the SoHo section of Manhattan for $15.4 million from Premier Equities. The transaction is part of a string of recent and pending purchases by Acadia in SoHo and along Greene Street totaling more than $100 million.</p>
<p>The latest deal for 37 Green St. was reported by brokerage firm Newmark Knight Frank. 37 Greene St. is a retail condo spanning 3,569 square feet on the ground floor, occupied by modern furniture store Kartell. The pre-war, cast-iron building was constructed in 1900. NKF’s Retail Capital Markets Senior Managing Director Brian Segall and Associate George Martinecz were the sole brokers on these transactions between Premier and Acadia.</p>
<p>This was the sixth such Greene Street retail condo sale to Acadia that NKF arranged in recent months. In its entirety, these transactions comprise the largest retail condo portfolio sale of 2019 in Manhattan and the largest on record in SoHo. Segall and Martinecz also sold the EMP Capital-developed retail condo at 47 Greene St. to Acadia, which traded for $24.8 million</p>
<p>In addition to 37 Greene St., other properties that were part of this overall transaction include 41 Greene St., which traded for $17.2 million; 45 Greene St. for $11.3 million; 51 Greene St. for $14.7 million and 53 Greene St. for $17.2 million.</p>
<p>Last year, Acadia reported it had acquired, or entered into contracts to acquire $121.8 million of New York City street retail assets in Soho. Of the $121.8 million, $86.8 million had closed by November 2019 and $35.0 million remained under contract. The company stated at the time it expected to complete the purchase of the remaining properties under contract in phases through 2020.</p>
<p>Among Acadia Realty’s notable Westchester County holdings include the Bedford Green Shopping Center in Bedford Hills; Cortlandt Crossing in Cortlandt Manor and the Crossroads Shopping Center in White Plains.</p>
<p>In addition to significant holdings in Manhattan, Acadia also owns properties in the Bronx and other New York City boroughs and on Long Island.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency announced recently it provided financial incentives for a wide range of new commercial developments that accounted for approximately $1.6 billion in new investment in Westchester County.</p>
<p>The projects incentivized in 2019 involved more than 2,800 in new proposed residential units. Some of the projects involved repurposing vacant office properties along the I-287 corridor. Others were transit-oriented developments slated to be built close to Metro-North train stations.</p>
<p>“Westchester County is attracting private investment not only from local and regional developers but national development companies as well. The message is clear—Westchester County is open for business,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.</p>
<p>“The wide range of development projects benefitting from IDA incentives speaks to the diversity and vitality of Westchester’s economy. Thanks to the success of our IDA, the county continues to be an attractive environment for businesses to prosper and grow,” said IDA Chairperson Joan McDonald.</p>
<p>The $1.6 billion in new investment fostered by the IDA incentives was more than double the investment total secured in 2018, according to Westchester County Office of Economic Development Director Bridget Gibbons.</p>
<p>The projects receiving financial incentives last year ranged from mixed-use residential developments to healthcare facilities to senior care communities to biotech companies. In addition to spurring economic development, these projects are estimated to generate thousands of construction and permanent jobs for the county,” she said.</p>
<p>Major development projects receiving IDA incentives in 2019 included:</p>
<p><strong>BioMed Realty</strong> was given approval of IDA incentives to expand its Ardsley Park biotech campus in the Town of Greenburgh with the renovation of 97,000 square feet of new state-of-the-art life sciences space. The $38-million development is projected to create 350 full-time jobs with a payroll of approximately $35 million.</p>
<p><strong>Simone Healthcare Development</strong> received IDA benefits for the renovation of a vacant, four-story office building at 104 Corporate Park Drive in Harrison into a pediatric care ambulatory facility that will be fully leased to Montefiore Medical Center. The IDA approved $1,328,021 in sales tax exemptions and $419,755 in mortgage tax exemptions for the project, which is anticipated to create approximately 100 construction jobs and 250 permanent healthcare related jobs.</p>
<p><strong>WP Mall Realty, LLC</strong> received preliminary approval for $17.5 million in sales tax and mortgage recording tax exemptions for Hamilton Green, a $585.2-million mixed-use, transit-oriented development located on Hamilton Avenue in Downtown White Plains. The project at the former White Plains Mall is comprised of 860 apartments, 85,400 square feet of specialty retail and restaurant space and 27,000 square feet of co-working office space. Approximately 1,437 construction and 500 full- and part-time jobs are expected to be created at full build-out of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Lennar Multifamily Company</strong> received preliminary approval for $12.15 million in sales tax and mortgage recording tax exemptions for the $500-million mixed-use development at the site of the former Westchester Pavilion at 60 South Broadway, White Plains. The project will be comprised of 814 apartments in two towers including 50 units affordable to 60% AMI. The project is estimated to create between 600 and 700 construction jobs and 20 permanent jobs.</p>
<p>The project has been delayed and Lennar recently reduced the amount of retail space planned for the development. The Westchester Pavilion at one time served as the headquarters for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p><strong>National Development</strong> received IDA approval for $3.22 million in sales tax and mortgage recording tax exemptions for a five-story, 132-unit independent living community to be built at 120 Bloomingdale Road in White Plains. The $115-million development will be targeted to active seniors. The development is projected to create 1,250 construction jobs and 48 full- and part-time jobs over the life of the project.</p>
<p><strong>RPW Group</strong> received financial incentives for a $95-million apartment complex to be built on a parking lot across from an office building at 1133 Westchester Ave. on the I-287 office corridor. The complex will be comprised of three separate five-story buildings on a 20-acre site with a total of 303 apartments. The IDA gave the project preliminary approval of $1.82 million in sales tax exemptions. The project is expected to create 120 construction jobs and eight full-time jobs.</p>
<p><strong>3 WPD Apartments LLC</strong> received incentives from the IDA for its plan to demolish a 160,000-square-foot vacant office building at 3 Westchester Park Drive in Harrison and replace it with a five-story, two-building complex featuring 450 rental apartments. The development, which represents a total private investment of $195 million, is projected to create 150 construction jobs. The applicant received a sales tax exemption of $5,402,000 and a mortgage tax exemption of $1,168,000.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The guidance, part of a sweeping update released by the Department of State on Jan. 31, signifies a reversal of the long-standing practice where tenants pay the agent’s commission in New York City and elsewhere in New York State.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The New York real estate industry, particularly downstate, is reeling from guidance recently released by the Department of State that now among other changes regarding regulations on landlords and agents, prohibits a landlord’s agent from collecting a broker/fee commission from a tenant in residential rental transactions.</p>
<p>The guidance, part of a sweeping update released by the Department of State on Jan. 31, signifies a reversal of the long-standing practice where tenants pay the agent’s commission in New York City and elsewhere in New York State. A temporary restraining order was issued on the tenant commission guidance. <strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: See updated story on Real Estate In-Depth.com.</p>
<p>The Department of State published the updated document for all licensees titled “Guidance for Real Estate Professionals Concerning the Statewide Housing Security &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019 and the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.”</p>
<p>The New York State Association of Realtors urged its members to take action and contact Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Secretary of State Rosana Rosado and state lawmakers to voice their opposition to the Department of State&#8217;s new guidance on rental broker fees.</p>
<p>NYSAR in its e-mail blast stated that if enforced, the new guidance would have &#8220;devastating effects on Realtors engaging in rental transactions.”</p>
<p>“The most immediate effect of this new guidance is that it will void current agreements between brokers and landlords where the tenant pays the commission,” NYSAR states. “The Department’s guidance has now created uncertainty in the payment for services already provided by the broker. Additionally, if a landlord&#8217;s agent does collect a commission from the tenant, that licensee would be subject to discipline by the Department of State.”</p>
<p>NYSAR General Counsel S. Anthony Gatto, Esq, in his online “Legal Lines” column that addressed the DOS Guidance, listed the following issues of concern:</p>
<p><strong>1. Licensees are Considered the Same as The Landlord if Acting as a Landlord’s Agent.</strong></p>
<p>This restriction applies to licensed real estate brokers and salespeople acting as an agent of the “landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor.”</p>
<p><strong>2. Commissions</strong></p>
<p>A landlord’s agent is prohibited from collecting the commission directly from the tenant. The commission must be paid to the landlord’s agent by the landlord. A tenant’s agent may be compensated by the listing broker or the tenant.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if a landlord’s agent does collect a commission from the tenant, that licensee may be subject to discipline by the DOS. Such discipline may include the return of the commission plus a fine and possible suspension/revocation of your license.</p>
<p><strong>3. $20 Credit/Background Check</strong></p>
<p>Licensees may only charge $20 per tenant that appear on the lease unless restricted by another agency.</p>
<p><em>NY RPL § 238-a(1)(b)A landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor may charge a fee or fees to reimburse costs associated with conducting a background check and credit check, provided the cumulative fee or fees for such checks is no more than the actual cost of the background check and credit check or twenty dollars, whichever is less…</em></p>
<p>If a licensee is involved in a rental where the landlord charges more than $20, the licensee must advise the landlord and is prohibited from collecting more than $20.</p>
<p>“A licensed agent that collects a fee greater than $20.00 or fails to advise the landlord that such fees are prohibited may be subject to discipline by the Department pursuant to Section 441-c of the New York Real Property Law. Additionally, if a prohibited fee is collected and the property is subject to rent regulation, the tenant may also seek appropriate relief through HCR.”</p>
<p>If a tenant produces their own report, the fee must be waived</p>
<p><em>NY RPL § 238-a(1)(b) “…the landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor shall waive the fee or fees if the potential tenant provides a copy of a background check or credit check conducted within the past thirty days.</em></p>
<p>Landlord/licensee may require the tenant to use a specific company if the cost is $20 or less. NYSAR recommends brokerages to create a list of companies that provide credit/background checks and have the proposed tenant choose from the list.</p>
<p>Landlord/licensee must provide a copy of the report to the tenant.</p>
<p><em>NY RPL § 238-a(1)(b) The landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor may not collect the fee or fees unless the landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor provides the potential tenant with a copy of the background check or credit check and the receipt or invoice from the entity conducting the background check or credit check.</em></p>
<p><strong>Condominiums/Cooperatives</strong></p>
<p>DOS will not discipline a license who collects a fee greater than $20.00 on behalf of a cooperative or condominium board when the board is not the owner of the rental apartment/unit. However, the DOS <strong>“cautions agents that the collection of such fees may nonetheless violate other laws, such as the prohibition against source of income discrimination.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Advances on Rent</strong></p>
<p>There are no advances for rentals including seasonal and college rentals.</p>
<p>Exempt if a housing subsidy is required to be in lump sum or by advance.</p>
<p><strong>5. Additional Fees</strong></p>
<p>Collection of pet deposits are prohibited. Unless otherwise prohibited by law or terms of a housing assistance program, a landlord may charge more rent to a tenant with pets.</p>
<p><em>GOL § 7-108(1-a)(a) No deposit or advance shall exceed the amount of one month’s rent under such contract.</em></p>
<p>In explaining what a security deposit can cover, DOS specifically cites:</p>
<p><em>GOL § 7-108(1-a)(b) non-payment of rent, damage caused by the tenant beyond normal wear and tear, non-payment of utility charges payable directly to the landlord under the terms of the lease or tenancy, and moving and storage of the tenant’s belongings. The landlord may not retain any amount of the deposit for costs relating to ordinary wear and tear of occupancy or damage caused by a prior tenant.</em></p>
<p><em>GOL § 7-108(1-a)(g) Any person who violates the provisions of this subdivision shall be liable for actual damages, provided a person found to have willfully violated this subdivision shall be liable for punitive damages of up to twice the amount of the deposit or advance.</em></p>
<p>Collection of other fees/expenses are also prohibited.</p>
<p><em>RPL § 238-a(1)(a) Except in instances where statutes or regulations provide for a payment, fee or charge, no landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor may demand any payment, fee, or charge for the processing, review or acceptance of an application, or demand any other payment, fee or charge before or at the beginning of the tenancy, except background checks and credit checks as provided by paragraph (b) of this subdivision, provided that this subdivision shall not apply to entrance fees charged by continuing care retirement communities licensed pursuant to article forty-six or forty-six-A of the public health law, assisted living providers licensed pursuant to article forty-six-B of the public health law, adult care facilities licensed pursuant to article seven of the social services law, senior residential communities that have submitted an offering plan to the attorney general, or not-for-profit independent retirement communities that offer personal emergency response, housekeeping, transportation and meals to their residents.</em></p>
<p><strong>6. Use of Prior Disputes</strong></p>
<p>Licensees must not be involved in a transaction where the landlord refuses to rent to as potential tenant on the basis that the potential tenant was involved in a past or pending landlord-tenant action. However, if the tenant is subject to a money judgment, regardless of the subject matter of the matter, the landlord may take the outstanding judgment into consideration.</p>
<p><em>NY RPL § 227-f(1) No landlord of a residential premises shall refuse to rent or offer a lease to a potential tenant on the basis that the potential tenant was involved in a past or pending landlord-tenant action or summary proceeding under article seven of the real property actions and proceedings law. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person is in violation of this section if it is established that the person requested information from a tenant screening bureau relating to a potential tenant or otherwise inspected court records relating to a potential tenant and the person subsequently refuses to rent or offer a lease to the potential tenant.</em></p>
<p>NYSAR recommends that licensees not include landlord/tenant actions on background checks.</p>
<p><strong>7. References</strong></p>
<p>A licensee may ask for a list of references from a potential tenant. When contacting the references, the licensee must not question any of the references about past or pending landlord-tenant actions or summary proceedings.</p>
<p><em>RPL § 227-f(1) No landlord of a residential premises shall refuse to rent or offer a lease to a potential tenant on the basis that the potential tenant was involved in a past or pending landlord-tenant action or summary proceeding under article seven of the real property actions and proceedings law. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person is in violation of this section if it is established that the person requested information from a tenant screening bureau relating to a potential tenant or otherwise inspected court records relating to a potential tenant and the person subsequently refuses to rent or offer a lease to the potential tenant.</em></p>
<p><strong>8. Late Fees</strong></p>
<p>Late fees can only be charged after five full days have passed.</p>
<p>Late fees can only be 5% of the rent of $50 whichever is less.</p>
<p>Leases signed prior to 7/14/2019 must comply with new late fee limits.</p>
<p><em>NY RPL § 238-a(2) landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor may demand any payment, fee, or charge for the late payment of rent unless the payment of rent has not been made within five days of the date it was due, and such payment, fee, or charge shall not exceed fifty dollars or five percent of the monthly rent, whichever is less.</em></p>
<p><strong>9. Security Deposits</strong></p>
<p>Must be the amount of one month’s rent or less.</p>
<p><em>GOL § 7-108(1-a)(a) No deposit or advance shall exceed the amount of one month’s rent under such contract.</em></p>
<p>Must be returned within 14 days after the tenant vacates the premises.</p>
<p>If the full amount is not being returned, an itemized statement must be provided to the tenant within the 14-day period listing all charges deducted from the security deposit.</p>
<p>Failure to return the security deposit within 14 days forfeits any right the landlord may have to the security deposit.</p>
<p><em>GOL § 7-108(1-a)(e) Within fourteen days after the tenant has vacated the premises, the landlord shall provide the tenant with an itemized statement indicating the basis for the amount of the deposit retained, if any, and shall return any remaining portion of the deposit to the tenant. If a landlord fails to provide the tenant with the statement and deposit within fourteen days, the landlord shall forfeit any right to retain any portion of the deposit.</em></p>
<p>If the lease was signed before 7/14/2019 and the security deposit held by the broker is greater than one month’s rent, the broker will not be disciplined by the DOS and will not be required to return the difference to the tenant.</p>
<p>If the 14th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the broker must return the security deposit on the next business day.</p>
<p><strong>10. Not Applicable to Commercial Transactions</strong></p>
<p>According to DOS, “The Acts do not impose any new requirements relating to commercial transactions.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The litigation was scheduled to be filed on Monday, Feb. 10. The litigation alleges that the Department of State usurped its role by engaging in improper rulemaking rather than following the necessary and required legal procedures for implementing a new regulation.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Terming the recently released guidance by the Department of State on brokerage commissions as “misguided” and “harmful,” the New York State Association of Realtors and the Manhattan-based Real Estate Board of New York announced on Feb. 7 their intent to file suit against New York State charging that the DOS overstepped its legal authority.</p>
<p>The litigation was  filed on Monday, Feb. 10. The litigation alleges that the Department of State usurped its role by engaging in improper rulemaking rather than following the necessary and required legal procedures for implementing a new regulation.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <strong>On Monday, Feb. 10, a New York State Supreme Court Judge in Albany granted a temporary restraining order that halts enforcement, at least until a hearing next month, Department of State guidance that would bar tenant-paid commissions. A full hearing on the Article 78 filing by NYSAR, REBNY and a host of major brokerage firms is scheduled for March 13.</strong></p>
<p>The leaders of NYSAR and REBNY released a statement after the judge&#8217;s issuance of the temporary restraining order. “The entry today by the court in Albany of an order temporarily halting the implementation of New York State Department of State’s (DOS) interpretation of the Statewide Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act means that thousands of hardworking, honest real estate agents across New York State can do business in the same way they did prior to last week’s DOS memo without fear of discipline by the DOS,&#8221; NYSAR and REBNY stated. &#8221; We look forward to ultimately resolving this matter in court in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, we appreciate all of our members’ support and vigilance during this period of upheaval and confusion. We also want to thank Claude Szyfer and his team at Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan LLP for their tireless efforts on this matter.”</p>
<p>The Department of State’s decision to announce this new rule in such a way has created widespread disruption for property owners, rental agents, and prospective tenants themselves—resulting in losses for brokers and landlords alike, NYSAR and REBNY stated in a joint announcement prior to the judge&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>“The New York State Association of Realtors is deeply concerned with the regulation’s content and the manner in which it was developed and promulgated. Real estate brokers provide valuable services to the consumer and the property owners and they should be fairly compensated. These regulations will severely and wrongly impact the incomes of hard-working real estate professionals,” said Jennifer Stevenson, president of the New York State Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>She continued, “It is unconscionable that a serious disruption of the marketplace has occurred without any industry input or even proper review by the State Board of Real Estate. We will use every resource available to us to fight against these unreasonable and punitive regulations.”</p>
<p>REBNY President James Whelan added, “We are asking the court to recognize that the Department of State illegally overstepped its role in issuing its new guidance on rental brokerage commissions. The announcement of this new rule without warning has caused widespread confusion and havoc among dedicated real estate agents and the clients they serve. The sudden decision and the way it was made public was harmful to thousands of hardworking New Yorkers.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW ROCHELLE—Mill Creek Residential of Boca Raton, FL has acquired a little more than two acres of land that housed the former Blessed Sacrament elementary school and will develop a new eight-story 334-unit multifamily project at the site.</p>
<p>The sale of the property was reported by commercial brokerage firm CBRE on Feb. 5, which represented Blessed Sacrament Church in the transaction. No financial terms of the transaction were disclosed.</p>
<p>Mill Creek plans to build the Modera New Rochelle development at the property located at 24 Maple Ave. and 115 Centre Ave. that when completed will feature eight studios, 201 one-bedroom, and 125 two-bedroom units. As part of the land sale, Mill Creek will be delivering a new parish center to the Blessed Sacrament parish, which continues to serve the New Rochelle Catholic community.</p>
<p>The project site will also include three courtyards and a pedestrian walkway on the northwestern side, according to information posted on the City of New Rochelle website. The City of New Rochelle approved the Modera New Rochelle project on May 29, 2019.</p>
<p>CBRE’s William V. Cuddy, Jr. and Jacqueline Novotny represented and advised the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in the transaction. Counsels for the seller in the transaction included Peter N. Bassano, Esq. from Bleakley Platt &amp; Schmidt, LLP and Michael D. Zarin, Esq. from Zarin &amp; Steinmetz.</p>
<p>“Blessed Sacrament Parish recognized the opportunity to convert its unused property to support its ongoing mission,” said Cuddy, Executive Vice President at CBRE. “We are thrilled to have the site trade hands to such a well-regarded player in the multifamily sector known for creating thoughtfully-designed apartment communities in thriving markets throughout the country.”</p>
<p>He continued, “As part of their efforts to enhance the communities where they build, Millcreek Residential has agreed to include a new parish center for the ongoing use of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament as part of their development plans. We are grateful to have worked on such a unique win-win situation”</p>
<p>The Blessed Sacrament elementary school closed in 2007, while the merged Blessed Sacrament/St. Gabriel’s High School was closed in 2013 by the Archdiocese of New York.</p>
<p>The property’s location offers various transportation options nearby, as well as restaurants, fitness centers and entertainment venues. The project site is within walking distance from the New Rochelle train station, offering service from Metro North and Amtrak, and is located one mile from Interstate-95.</p>
<p>Blessed Sacrament Pastor Rev. William Luiciano addressed the sale of the property to parishioners on the church’s website.</p>
<p>While not divulging the sale price, Rev. Luciano stated, “First of all, we are happy to announce that the over $12-million debt that Blessed Sacrament Church has accumulated, over the last 50 years or so, has been totally eliminated.”</p>
<p>He noted that the closure of the elementary and high schools left the parish with accumulated debts of more than $3 million.</p>
<p>“You can see that not only was the Parish not paying the principal on these debts, but was also not paying the interest that was accruing,” Rev. Luciano stated in his “From the Pastor’s Desk blog. “It seemed hopeless that this large debt would ever be addressed. Well, now it has. Not only addressed, but eliminated.”</p>
<p>He added that the proceeds from the sale will also allow the church to put money aside for the future and stated that the parish is now “debt free, financially stable, growing and is able to address the needs of those we serve.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the region, Mill Creek Residential Trust acquired the 504-unit The Peaks of Nanuet apartment in Rockland County in a deal reportedly valued at $180 million in late 2019.</p>
<p>The firm purchased the property from a partnership of New York City-based Harbor Group International and Azure Partners.</p>
<p>Mill Creek also developed the 324-unit Modera Hudson Riverfront in Yonkers, which it sold in April 2019, according to its website.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TARRYTOWN—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors has re-launched its Young Professionals Network group for 2020, following a two-year hiatus. YPN, which was originally established by the National Association of Realtors in 2006, is tasked with helping the younger generation of Realtors build a stronger link with the real estate industry and expand networking and business opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we surveyed our membership last year for our new Strategic Planning process, one of the surprising things we learned is how many younger agents are entering the business—some even choosing real estate as a first career,” explained HGAR President Gail Fattizzi. “Working with some of them myself, I understand how much they are looking for a support network, and trying to figure out how to engage and get involved in the industry on a higher level.”</p>
<p>Fattizzi tapped Richard Herska, HGAR’s Regional Director for Rockland County, to chair the newly re-launched group, which held its 2020 Kickoff Networking event at Bistro Z at the DoubleTree Hotel in Tarrytown on Feb. 5. “I’m also a member of the association’s new engagement task force so my goal is to help provide networking and education for all of our new members—and anyone who would like to be more involved,” said Herska.</p>
<p>Other events for the year will include happy hour mixers in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, and Orange counties, as well as the Bronx. In addition, YPN will work with HGAR’s Education Council to offer interesting panel discussions and workshops to help agents with their businesses. “We want our new members—and even our seasoned members—to know that the door is always open to you at YPN,” added Herska.</p>
<p>He also plans to get YPN involved with community service, and looks forward to working with the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation to participate in more volunteer efforts.</p>
<p>“Jen Stevenson, our NYSAR President, has chosen ‘community service’ as her theme for 2020,” explained Herska. “I think it’s so important that we Realtors also give back to the local communities.”</p>
<p>YPN events will be posted on HGAR.com and all are welcome to attend. Their motto is “Young in age, young in the business and young at heart.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Jan. 31, the New York State Department of State issued further guidance with respect to the Statewide Housing Security and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 and the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (the “2019 Acts”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2xA6lth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2xA6lth</a>] passed on June 14, 2019. The publication, entitled “The Guidance for Real Estate Professionals Concerning the Statewide Housing Security &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019 and the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019” (the “DOS Guidance”) [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/38fcL1N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/38fcL1N</a>], provides additional FAQs and guidance supplementing the previous publication issued by the DOS on Sept. 13, 2019 (“Initial DOS Guidance”) [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2Sd9TwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2Sd9TwA</a>].</p>
<p>The DOS, without engaging in any formal rule making process, attempted to overturn the long-standing practice in New York City, Westchester, Rockland and Orange counties, among other areas, whereby tenants are required to pay the “broker fee” (i.e., commission) in connection with real estate rentals. The DOS’s actions caused widespread chaos, and caused NYSAR, REBNY and several brokerage firms to file an Article 78 proceeding in Albany on Feb. 10, seeking an injunction against the DOS relating to the ban on the payment of commissions by tenants [see <em>The Real Deal</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/39kutB1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39kutB1</a>].</p>
<p><strong>The Controversial DOS Guidance: FAQ #5</strong></p>
<p>On the afternoon of Feb. 10, a New York State Supreme Court Judge in Albany quickly ruled and issued a temporary restraining order against the DOS restricting its enforcement and implementation of FAQ #5, which attempted to bar landlords from requiring tenants to pay commissions (i.e., broker fees) in connection with a rental, which has been the custom in many areas. The other parts of the DOS Guidance were not affected by the TRO.</p>
<p>HGAR’s <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2UIcVuG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2UIcVuG</a>], quoted NYSAR President, Jennifer Stevenson, who pointed out that NYSAR “…is deeply concerned with the regulation’s content and the manner in which it was developed and promulgated.” Stevenson stated that “Itt is unconscionable that a serious disruption of the marketplace has occurred without any industry input or even proper review by the State Board of Real Estate. We will use every resource available to us to fight against these unreasonable and punitive regulations.” The court has stayed the DOS Guidance until March 13, when the parties are scheduled to appear in court for a hearing on the matter.</p>
<p>FAQ #5 basically interprets New York Real Property Law § 238-a(1)(a) to mean that any commission or “broker fee” required to be paid by the tenant on any rental would be prohibited and specified that any landlord’s agent collecting such fee on behalf of a landlord would be subject to DOS discipline. FAQ #5 reads as follows:</p>
<p><strong>“5. Can A Landlord’s Agent Collect a “Broker Fee” From the Prospective Tenant?”</strong></p>
<p>No, a landlord’s agent cannot be compensated by the prospective tenant for bringing about the meeting of the minds. NY RPL § 238-a(1)(a) provides, in part, ‘no landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor may demand any payment, fee, or charge for the processing, review or acceptance of an application, or demand any other payment, fee or charge before or at the beginning of the tenancy, except background checks and credit checks….’ The fee to bring about the meeting of the minds would be a ‘payment, fee or charge before or at the beginning of the tenancy’ other than a background or credit check as provided in this section. Accordingly, a landlord’s agent that collects a fee for bringing about the meeting of the minds between the landlord and tenant (i.e., the broker fee) from the tenant can be subject to discipline.”</p>
<p>When a new law is enacted by the legislature or a new rule is being introduced by the DOS, the State and/or DOS usually provide the public with advance notice, public hearings, public comment periods, as well as critical guidance (after legislation is enacted), so that all of those affected are aware of what the requirements are with regard to any such new legislation or rules.</p>
<p>This was not the case with the initial enactment of the 2019 Acts nor with the issuance of this latest DOS Guidance. The 2019 Acts were passed in the dead of the night with little to no involvement of the public or the opposition. After enactment of the 2019 Acts, the only guidance provided to the public was issued nearly three months later, and left many questions unanswered.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, many in the industry reached out to the DOS and provided countless issues and concerns regarding the ambiguity and confusion caused by the 2019 Acts. Several lawsuits were commenced to overturn the new legislation soon after its enactment. Now, more than four months after the Initial DOS Guidance was issued, the DOS provided its latest guidance and in doing so, simply decided to prohibit a customary practice engaged in by many agents. The issue of prohibiting the payment of commission by tenants was never directly addressed in the 2019 Acts, nor was it ever meant to be their focus.</p>
<p>According to HGAR’s <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2UIcVuG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2UIcVuG</a>], the litigation filed by the petitioners against the DOS alleges that the DOS “…usurped its role by engaging in improper rulemaking rather than following the necessary and required legal procedures for implementing a new regulation.”</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Rule Making Process’</strong></p>
<p>The DOS’s Division of Administrative Rules explains that the “rule making process” consists of “…procedures that are followed by state agencies when adopting rules…. This process is designed to ensure that the public has an opportunity to comment on, and participate in, the adoption of such rules.” [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2OJMVLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2OJMVLD</a>]. Clearly, there was no “rule making process” followed by the DOS in issuing this latest DOS Guidance. The DOS unilaterally determined that “[t]he fee to bring about the meeting of the minds would be a ‘payment, fee or charge before or at the beginning of the tenancy’ other than a background or credit check as provided in this section&#8230;&#8221; and that this would subject a licensee to discipline.</p>
<p>The DOS is aware that it is customary in many areas that tenants pay the broker’s commission or fee on rentals. Yet, rather than attempt to bring the issue to light and discuss it with the real estate industry, it seemingly promulgated a new “rule” and prohibiting the practice altogether. Whether or not this was permissible will eventually be determined as part of the lawsuit, but needless to say, there was no attempt made to engage those most directly affected by such a decision, nor was any advance announcement made to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Irreparable Harm Caused to the Industry</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the DOS Guidance, the real estate industry was sent into a tailspin last week. On Friday, Feb. 7, both HGAR and NYSAR issued alerts to their members advising them to refrain from collecting any commissions or broker fees from tenants. Similarly, many brokerage firms did the same and informed their landlord clients that they would now be required to pay the commissions. Tenants were now informed that they no longer were required to pay commissions which, prior to the DOS Guidance, they had agreed to pay. The entire commission landscape was changed overnight.</p>
<p>While tenant advocate groups lauded the DOS Guidance as a huge win for tenants, those on the opposite end were blindsided, with no opportunity to be heard or to defend their position and livelihood. It was reported that landlords had already begun to instruct their agents to increase rents so they could recoup the increased expenses. Although the real estate rental market was only temporarily upended, in light of the TRO offering temporary injunctive relief, the DOS’s action has already caused irreparable harm. It has been reported that tenants are already refusing to pay commissions they were required to pay immediately prior to issuance of the DOS Guidance. It may be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle even if the DOS Guidance is ultimately invalidated by the courts.</p>
<p><strong>The Rest of the DOS Guidance and Important NYSAR Advisory</strong></p>
<p>It is important for real estate agents and brokers to note that the remaining parts of the DOS Guidance have not been affected by the lawsuit and should be followed. NYSAR has also provided an important Advisory [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2OLzE4X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2OLzE4X</a>] on the DOS Guidance. Below are some of the important points highlighted in the new DOS Guidance, which could subject licensees to discipline:</p>
<p>No landlord’s agent or landlord may request or accept any security deposit or advance payment of rent greater than one month’s rent under any such lease or rental agreement. However, if the lease was signed prior to June 14, 2019, then the landlord or agent may continue to hold the same security deposit even if it exceeds one month.</p>
<p>No additional security deposits are allowed for pets or move in expenses. However, NYSAR does point out that a landlord is permitted to charge higher rent where there is a pet, but agents should note there are legal requirements and restrictions relating to service animals, etc.</p>
<p>If there is more than one tenant applying for an apartment, a landlord, broker or agent may charge up to $20.00 per applicant for each background or credit check.</p>
<p>Late fees are limited to 5% of the monthly rent amount up to a maximum of $50.00, only for payments not made within five days of the due date.</p>
<p>If a landlord or landlord’s agent conducts a background or credit check, the landlord or landlord’s agent must provide the tenant with a copy of same before collecting the $20.00 fee from the tenant.</p>
<p>A landlord or landlord’s agent can also require that a tenant use a specific company to conduct the background or credit check provided it adheres to new requirements of the law.</p>
<p>An agent may request a list of references from a tenant; however, the agent may not ask about any past or pending landlord-tenant actions in which the tenant is or was involved. NY RPL Section 227-f(1) provides that “There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person is in violation of this section if it is established that the person requested information from a tenant screening bureau relating to a potential tenant or otherwise inspected court records relating to a potential tenant and the person subsequently refuses to rent or offer a lease to the potential tenant.”</p>
<p><strong>Where Does the NY Rental Market Go from Here?</strong></p>
<p>The changes in the law and the newly issued DOS Guidance have certainly caused an upheaval of the real estate rental market in New York. These changes will have lasting effects from both the landlord and tenant sides, but ultimately, it will be left up to the courts to determine whether the 2019 Acts and the DOS Guidance will be allowed to survive.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the roll out of both has caused widespread chaos and uncertainty, but regardless of whether you are an advocate of tenants or landlords, the rights of all individuals need to be taken into account, and one group’s rights should not be any less important than another’s rights. While this is all being sorted out in the courts, all individuals affected must seek the advice of counsel before embarking on a path that could lead to potential violations.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><em>“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.</em><br />
<strong>Socrates</strong></p>
<p>I thought it would be a good idea to focus this month’s article on the subject of change. There’s a lot of change taking place in our industry. Tenant rights are being strengthened, and with it there are changes to the amounts a landlord can demand for security deposits and amounts that can be charged for background/credit checks.</p>
<p>Also, fair housing is changing and being bolstered. Continuing education is changing by increasing requirements and eventually it will become mandatory for all licensees. We have a new MLS beginning, with new status categories and fields. NAR has made changes to the biennial (now triennial) Code of Ethics training and created new clear cooperation rules which will soon be going into effect. However, as we all know, the greatest change came when the New York State Department of State suddenly, with no prior notice, announced that the way many agents conduct business and collect commissions in our region must immediately stop…yet, days later, we were informed that a filed lawsuit would stay this change. What’s the end result? We shall see. (See <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/nysar-rebny-file-suit-against-new-dos-commission-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage of the commission collection issue</a>).</p>
<p>All this change has left many reeling, frustrated, and confused (I know because my voicemail is full and my inbox is overflowing). What we all need to do is stop, take a step back, and look at the bigger picture. Take a minute and breathe. Robert Eliot once said, “Rule number one is, don’t sweat the small stuff. Rule number two is, it’s all small stuff.” We need to breathe, look at our industry, what we do, and take it all in. Yes, there has been a lot of change, but the reality is that all this change is small stuff. These changes that have come or are coming are small modifications of what we do on a bigger scale. Agents will still list houses, go to open houses, build our businesses, drive buyers around, negotiate on deals, work endless hours on weekends and late into the night and participate in activities with other Realtors and the public in an effort to raise their profile and commitment to excellence. All these changes do not change the core of what you do and, rest assured, all agents will continue to get paid for all the hard work they do. You are still Realtors; dedicated and committed to your clients and your business. You still care about people and what you do.</p>
<p>So, with all these rapid-fire changes, what do you do now? First, don’t get overwhelmed. As I said before, these are all small things. Each one is a singular issue, so you should treat them as small bumps, not insurmountable mountains. Address your first issue of change and look at it for what it is. It’s not changing your business in its entirety, it’s just a small change in how you operate. Keep it all in perspective.</p>
<p>Second, do your homework. Take each change and find out exactly what is it… and what it isn’t. Read everything out there about it. You have tremendous resources. HGAR publishes <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> both online and it’s mailed to many of you. NYSAR and NAR both have publications online and hardbound. Check your inbox and the MLS for information, updates, advisories and announcements on a daily basis. Speak to your managers/brokers/owners. Attend office meetings and HGAR events. Additionally, there are trade meetings/events, podcasts, trade publications, and the newspapers. All of these are resources designed to get the right information to you.</p>
<p>Third, and probably most importantly, ask questions, listen, and take notes. If, after all your research, you have more questions, reach out to your manager/broker, a colleague, a board member, or the HGAR Member Success Team for guidance. If you still have questions, that’s okay. Ask them. Reach out to the NYSAR Legal Hotline or e-mail me. I am always available to answer your questions. Listen, take notes, and ask more questions.</p>
<p><em>“In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers.”</em><br />
<strong>Fred Rogers</strong></p>
<p>In closing, we need to take stock in the fact that our industry is changing at a breakneck speed. You are equipped to handle this change and you have tools and support from everyone around you to succeed. Keep your world in focus and maintain a keen focus on your goals. Change can be challenging, but change is a part of growing, evolving, maturing.</p>
<p>I leave you with two final quotes to ponder:</p>
<p><em>“The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.”</em><br />
<strong>Alan Watts</strong></p>
<p><em>“You must welcome change as the rule but not as your ruler.”</em><br />
<strong>Denis Waitley</strong></p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TOWN OF WALLKILL—The golf course industry nationwide and in the New York metro region continues to struggle with declining memberships and revenues. A host of facilities in the Hudson Valley have turned to either outright sale or multifamily development on their course properties to increase revenues.</p>
<p>These deals in some cases are geared to maintaining golf on their properties, while others have involved the elimination of golf course operations and the sale to a new owner that plans an entirely different use.</p>
<p>The latest example of this emerging trend is the West Hills Country Club in the Town of Wallkill in Orange County. The ownership, West Hills Enterprises, LLC, an affiliate of the Bonura Hospitality Group, has filed for a series of zoning variances with the Town of Wallkill Zoning Board of Appeals in connection with a $37-million plan to build a 156-unit rental multifamily project on a 2.6-acre parcel where the practice green and first hole tee-box is currently located off Golf Links Road and across the street from the golf course clubhouse and catering facilities at 121 Golf Links Road.</p>
<p>The project is in its early stages and will require three variances to allow for increased building height and length and an increase from two stories to four stories. All of the variances would require significant increases in current permitted uses from a permitted 35 feet to 66.5 feet in height; an increase from a maximum of two-stories to four stories (not including two stories of underground parking) in height and an increase in building length from 160 feet to 585.5 feet.</p>
<p>The project will not only require ZBA approval, but will also necessitate site plan approval from the Town Board in order to proceed if it is allowed to move forward as proposed by the ZBA. The putting green and tee box would be relocated nearby.</p>
<p>Bonura principal Joseph Bonura Jr. appeared at a ZBA meeting in January to make the case for the 156-unit luxury project that would involve one elevatored building that would be four stories above grade and two stories of underground parking. The units would be mainly one- and two-bedroom units with a few three-bedroom units.</p>
<p>Bonura said after the Jan. 13th session that if the project secures approvals, he would expect construction to begin sometime in 2021 and take approximately two years to complete.</p>
<p>Bonura Hospitality, which owns and operates Anthony’s Pier 9 in Newburgh, The Grand View and the Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel, as well as a number of popular dining venues including Blue Pointe and Shadows on the Hudson in Newburgh, acquired the former Orange County Golf Club that borders the Wallkill River in 2012 for more than $1 million in a deed in lieu of foreclosure proceeding.</p>
<p>Bonura said that since the purchase, Bonura Hospitality has spent approximately $9 million to upgrade the golf course and expand catering facilities at the property. Since then, the catering operations have been profitable, but the golf club has lost membership and is being supported by the catering business at the property.</p>
<p>In a Dec. 2, 2019 filing with the Town of Wallkill ZBA requesting the variances submitted by law firm Dickover, Donnelly &amp; Donovan, stated, “After operating the facility for nearly seven years, the stark economic reality is that the event venue performs well, while the golf club does not. Forecasting this long-term it is clear that the event facility will not be able to continue to underwrite the losses of the golf club. Accordingly, the Bonura family now proposes to construct the above described project to ensure their investment in the property remains viable.”</p>
<div id="attachment_31276" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/west-hills-country-club-wedding-cottage-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31276" class=" wp-image-31276" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/west-hills-country-club-wedding-cottage-3.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="248" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-31276" class="wp-caption-text">West Hills Country Club Wedding Cottage</p></div>
<p>Bonura explained at the ZBA hearing that the firm wants to maintain the golf course operations at West Hills, which began on April 26, 1899 when 37 prominent citizens from Goshen and Middletown established Orange County Golf Club.</p>
<p>He noted that current zoning would allow Bonura to build more than 250 units on the property in multiple buildings, but that would require the cessation of the 18-hole golf course, which was not an option the firm wished to pursue, he noted.</p>
<p>Bonura said that while West Hills could operate as is for some time, “It is just not fun to lose money on 187 acres (the golf course) and only make money on three (acres).”</p>
<p>Bonura Hospitality has already built the Water Club luxury apartment development in Poughkeepsie and is looking to develop “The Kingstonian, a $58-million mixed-use development in Kingston. The project will feature 144 rental apartments, a 32-room hotel, 8,000 square feet of retail space and a parking garage. That project is currently in the approval process.</p>
<p>When asked what the Bonura firm would do if the West Hills project does not secure the necessary approvals to proceed, Bonura stated to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, “We are going to keep the golf course going as long as we can and at some point when it is no longer fun to do that, we will sell to the highest bidder.”</p>
<p>The West Hills Golf Club is just one of a number of Hudson Valley golf clubs that have made headlines of late.</p>
<p>The former Ridgeway Golf Club in White Plains was sold to the French American School, which then embarked on a very controversial plan to build new facilities at the golf course, which was subsequently closed. At present, no construction has begun on the new school facilities.</p>
<p>The former Canyon Club now rebranded as the Brynwood Golf &amp; Country Club in Armonk is slated to have 88 luxury condos built on a portion of the golf course.</p>
<p>New York City-based Corigin acquired the Canyon Club in December 2009. Prior to the opening of the new golf season in April 2010, the property was fully renovated and rebranded as Brynwood Golf &amp; Country Club. The repositioning encompassed the renovation of a 65,000-square foot clubhouse, as well as significant enhancements to the existing 18-hole golf course, pool and nine Har-Tru tennis courts. In October 2012, the North Castle Town Board voted to accept Brynwood’s zoning petition to create 88 luxury condominium residences, designed and targeted to the active adult market. The approval of this proposal will result in a signature Rees Jones designed golf course and a world-class clubhouse and residential community designed by the renowned architects Hart Howerton.</p>
<p>Golf course operations ceased recently and Corigin has undertaken some site and demolition work but has yet to file an application for site plan approval for its residential project. It is expected that the golf course will resume operations at some point.</p>
<p>The former Elmwood Country Club in Mamaroneck is being proposed to be converted to a nine-hole course to make way for a development of 175 age-restricted townhomes. That project has been controversial and is the subject of litigation between the developer and the Town of Mamaroneck over the environmental review of the project, according to a published report.</p>
<p>According to the National Golf Foundation’s 2019 Golf Facilities Report released in May 2019, the number of course closures has outweighed new openings for 13 consecutive years during what the NGF termed the ongoing balancing of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the cumulative reduction in the number of U.S. golf courses is 8%. By comparison, there was a 44% increase in the number of courses from 1986 through 2005. The NGF noted that period of nearly two decades was an unprecedented period of growth that coincided with a robust economy, a surge of interest driven in part by the play (and popularity) of Tiger Woods, and the desire to build golf courses to help sell homes.</p>
<p>Now, the demand for land to develop residential and commercial real estate is influencing the supply correction in golf.</p>
<p>Closures tend to be more value oriented, public facilities in the best-supplied areas. Florida, Texas, Ohio, California and New York had the most closures in 2018 and all rank among the top six states with the most golf courses, according to the NGF.</p>

Route 17]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—Although Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Legislature are currently grappling with how to close a $6-billion budget shortfall, representatives of a coalition advocating for a $500-million project to expand Route 17 from Harriman in Orange County to Monticello in Sullivan County are undeterred in their belief that now is the time to move forward with the project.</p>
<p>The Mid-Hudson region has seen significant economic growth in recent years. The Route 17 corridor in Orange and Sullivan counties will soon have to contend with additional traffic from the LEGOLAND New York resort in Goshen, which is scheduled to open in July; and Amy’s Kitchen in Goshen. Route 17, which currently features two lanes in the east and westbound directions, is the primary arterial to the fledgling Resorts World Catskills Casino Resort and the adjoining Kartrite Resort &amp; Waterpark in Monticello, as well as the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, also in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>In Orange County, in addition to LEGOLAND New York, which will feature a new Exit 125 being built by developer Merlin Entertainment, the southern part of the county at the junction of Route 17 and I-87 is the highly popular Woodbury Common Premium Outlet, which is also in the approval process for another expansion project. A total of approximately 13 million visitors frequent Woodbury Common each year.</p>
<p>Nearby, a possible second casino facility to be operated by the owner of Resort Catskills could be in the offing on a parcel off Route 17 in Harriman if the $100-million electronic gaming project secures approval from the State Legislature.</p>
<p>Construction was recently completed on $150 million in state roadway and bridge improvements in and around Exit 131 near Woodbury Common and the New York State Thruway, including the introduction of cashless tolling.</p>
<p>If that were not enough business activity for the Route 17 corridor, Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus recently told <em>Real Estate In-Dept</em>h that Great Wolf Lodge is considering a number of Orange County sites for possible development, including the former Camp LaGuardia property off Route 17 in the towns of Blooming Grove and Chester. Great Wolf is also considering other properties in Orange County as well.  Neuhaus recently revealed that the county will be releasing a Request for Proposals for the Camp LaGuardia property, which is owned by Orange County.</p>
<p>A panel of representatives from the 17 Forward 86 coalition briefed a group of real estate professionals on Feb. 14. The panel at the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Commercial Investment Division session held at the HGAR offices in Goshen featured Maureen Halahan, president and CEO, Orange County Partnership and co-chair of 17-Forward-86; Michael Lawler, partner, Checkmate Strategies, and Director of 17-Forward-86; Michael Fleischer, Esq., president, Strategic Public Affairs NY, a lobbyist for the coalition and Daniel Ortega, community affairs, Engineers Labor-Employer Cooperative, coalition member.</p>
<div id="attachment_31261" style="width: 509px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/17-84-Fleischer-pic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31261" class=" wp-image-31261" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/17-84-Fleischer-pic.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-31261" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Fleischer, Esq., president, Strategic Public Affairs NY, said the coalition a PEL study on the Route 17 corridor could begin in April.</p></div>
<p>Lawler said that since Gov. Cuomo proposed a two-year capital program instead of a five-year plan, the $500 million cost for the project will have to be secured in two different NYSDOT capital programs.</p>
<p>“Our objective now is to move the ball forward and get at least $100 million in construction funds in the second year of the two-year capital plan,” he said. Lawler said that the Route 17 expansion initiative has received unanimous support from the Hudson Valley state delegation.</p>
<p>Ortega estimated that the five-year construction project would employ approximately 500 construction workers and result in the creation of another 1,000 indirect jobs.</p>
<p>17-Forward-86 launched its campaign on March 6, 2019 at a press conference in Albany. The coalition is seeking $500 million from New York State to add a third lane east and west on Route 17 to enable future designation as Interstate 86 in the region. The coalition proposes that NYSDOT budget $100 million over a five-year period.</p>
<p>Last year, the coalition scored a significant victory when NYSDOT announced its intent to undertake a $5-million Planning and Environmental Linkage study (PEL), that will identify priority locations for improvement and conduct necessary environmental assessments and preliminary engineering. Fleischer said the PEL study is expected to begin in April.</p>
<p>Halahan said that there is an unprecedent pipeline of potential development projects coming to Orange County and the one major headwind that could deter future economic growth is traffic on Route 17. In fact, the specter of traffic congestion is causing some communities in Orange County to either consider or implement a building moratorium. The Town of New Windsor has imposed a moratorium on residential and commercial development, while the Town of Montgomery, which recently approved a more than 1 million-square-foot Amazon warehouse project, is also considering a moratorium. Another more than 1-million-square-foot distribution facility in Montgomery proposed by health care products manufacturer Medline is currently in the approval process as well.</p>
<p>The hotel industry is banking on business growth in the region. At present, there are approximately 52 hotels in Orange County that are either open, under construction or in the planning stages, accounting for approximately 4,400 rooms. Many of these hotel properties are located along the Route 17 corridor, Halahan noted. At present, there are seven hotels actively in the construction or planning stages in Orange County, six of which are located adjacent to Route 17. “And there are more coming,” she said.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>YONKERS—At its Feb. 19th session, the Board of Directors of the Yonkers Industrial Development agency granted preliminary approval of proposed financial incentives for a movie studio complex to be built at the iPark complex here.</p>
<p>The incentives are in connection with the $60-million first phase of the studio complex for Lionsgate motion picture company. The approximately 109,000-square-foot development, which would be built on the parking lot of the iPark Hudson complex, will include 70,000 square feet of studio space and 38,600 square feet of ancillary spaces. The project is anticipated to create between 285 to 420 full-time permanent jobs as well as 400 construction jobs.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/100m-film-studio-to-be-developed-at-ipark-complex-in-yonkers/">overall $100-million Lionsgate studio project</a> was announced in September 2019 by Lionsgate and partner Great Point Capital Management.</p>
<p>Great Point Capital Management, a media-focused investment fund run by Robert Halmi and Fehmi Zeko, announced it had signed a letter of intent with global content leader Lionsgate last year to build the new production facility in Yonkers. Lionsgate would be a long-term anchor tenant and investor in the studio complex. As anchor tenant, Lionsgate will have naming rights to the studio.</p>
<p>The new facility will be located in the heart of the iPark Hudson campus, owned by National Resources of Greenwich, CT, which is an investment partner and will be the developer of the complex. i.Park is a 24-acre technology and office campus, home to Mindspark (an IAC company), The Energy Project, Hudson Global, Kawasaki Rail Car, various city and state agencies as well as UNO, a 100-micro unit building.</p>
<p>“According to the industry experts, a lot of the talent wants to be in the New York metro area and Yonkers fits very well into this model. We think this project will have a transformational effect on the downtown of Yonkers,” said Joseph Cotter, president and CEO of National Resources in his presentation to the IDA Board.</p>
<p>He estimated that the development will create approximately $65 million annually in economic development due to the additional companies that will relocate to service the studios, such as caterers and production people.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to have this transformative project in our downtown. This development will position the City of Yonkers as the New York area&#8217;s premier filming destination,” said Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano who serves as Chairman of the Yonkers IDA.</p>
<p>The Yonkers IDA also granted preliminary approval of financial incentives to Waverly Properties, Inc., owner of Westchester Metal Works, for an $8-million expansion of its operations in the city. The company plans to relocate its operations to a new 20,000-square-foot facility at 1100 Saw Mill River Road in Yonkers.</p>
<p>The company, which is a metals manufacturer and fabricator, is currently located at 55 Knowles St. in the Ludlow section of Yonkers.</p>
<p>Westchester Metal Works, which employs 30 Yonkers residents, said it plans to add 22 more employees at the new larger facility. In order to move to the new location, the company needs to remove debris and concrete slabs at the site, which it estimated would cost $4 million.</p>
<p>Construction of the new facility is expected to create approximately 100 construction jobs, the YIDA stated.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[On May 4, Gov. Andrew Cuomo confirmed reports that in addition to the 50-year-old attorney, three members of his family and a neighbor have also tested positive for Novel Coronavirus.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—As governments across the globe deal with the spread of the Novel Coronavirus—or COVID-19—the crisis hit home earlier this week when it was learned that an attorney from New Rochelle tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>On March 4, Gov. Andrew Cuomo confirmed reports that in addition to the 50-year-old attorney, three members of his family and a neighbor have also tested positive for Novel Coronavirus.</p>
<p>While the federal and state governments continue to scramble to deal with the crisis, many real estate professionals are expressing fears that COVID-19 could possibly cause national and international markets to suffer at least in the short term.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve on March 3 in a surprise move took action in direct response to the Coronavirus’ potential impact on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>While noting that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong, the evolving risks to economic activity from the Coronavirus prompted the Federal Open Market Committee to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to a range of 1.0% to 1.25%.</p>
<p>Commercial brokerage firm CBRE in its “US Marketflash” report released on March 4, stated that the markets are pricing an additional 50 basis points in cuts before the end of the year by the Federal Reserve. The firm noted in its briefing that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited challenges for the travel industry and industries with global supply chains but noted that the extent of the impact remains highly uncertain.</p>
<p>“Monetary policy alone will not be enough to mute negative economic impacts from COVID-19. Additional policy responses—particularly from fiscal authorities—will be needed. To that end, the G7 finance ministers affirmed their ‘commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.’ While G7 leaders did not announce any definitive plan of action, they have additional capacity to mitigate risks to the economy posed by the spread of COVID-19. At the outside, the lifting of trade tariffs is a possibility.”</p>
<p>Noting that commercial real estate fundamentals at the onset of the crisis were in an extremely strong position and labor markets very tight, CBRE expects companies will likely maintain employment through the crisis.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, property markets will reflect the broader economy, which is expected to see a short-term slowdown. Should the spread of the virus prove to be only seasonal, impacts will lessen as the weather warms, allowing for stronger growth in the second half of the year,” CBRE states.</p>
<p>The firm also expects capital market transactions to slow at least in the short term, but that capital values will be resilient. “Additionally, there may be some impact on leasing, as decisions on new space are deferred until later in the year. With the 10-year Treasury trading at historically low levels—below 1% for the first time—low interest rates will be a positive factor for property markets,” CBRE states.</p>
<p>In terms of its views on COVID-19’s impact on individual markets, CBRE predicts:</p>
<p><strong>“Hotels:</strong> There has been a reduction in business and leisure travel, both globally and domestically. Using the SARS pandemic of 2003 as an example, the hotel industry could be severely impacted for up to six months.</p>
<p><strong>Retail:</strong> Near-term impacts will occur due to reductions in travel, particularly for food and beverage establishments, entertainment venues and fashion retailers. Omnichannel retailers could see some near-term upside as consumers avoid stores and shopping malls, but consumer sentiment may weigh on the sector over a longer period.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial:</strong> Manufacturing and distribution facilities may be impacted by lack of inventory as supply chains are disrupted. Broader economic impacts could further weigh on the industrial sector as reductions in both supply and demand ripple across the economy. Conversely, if the virus prompts more people to shop for goods and food online, this would bolster demand for last-mile distribution space.</p>
<p><strong>Office and Multifamily:</strong> Impacts on fundamentals in these sectors likely will be secondary and more closely associated with overall economic activity.</p>
<p><strong>Construction: </strong>Building material supply chains are being affected with significant backlogs at Chinese ports. Imports from other parts of Asia are also being impacted. Multifamily construction likely will feel the most acute effects due to the importance of Asian-sourced materials for residential construction.’</p>
<p>CBRE predicts that downside risks have increased as COVID-19 spreads worldwide and that market volatility is a threat to consumer confidence, which has been critical to the economic growth the U.S. has experienced in the past year</p>
<p>“It is unlikely that confidence will return until the spread of COVID-19 is contained, which is why the Fed acted urgently today,” CBRE states. “Furthermore, fiscal and monetary policymakers retain significant capacity to act forcefully in response to additional downside risks posed by this evolving threat to economic activity. In the long term, pent-up demand and the lagged effects of monetary policy should provide significant tailwinds to the global economy.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[This article will address the most notable and important changes.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>OneKey MLS, our new joint venture multiple listing service, will go live March 24, 2020. With this new change comes modifications to what you will see and input into our Matrix system, as well as some procedural changes. This article will address the most notable and important changes.</p>
<p><strong>New Status Changes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pending:</strong> As you may have already seen, Matrix has changed or added many status notations. The first is the change from “Contract” to “Pending.” Where a purchase agreement has been fully executed, with or without contingencies, the status term will now be called “Pending” instead of “Contract.” There is no change to the requirements for inputting this change.</p>
<p><strong>Off Market:</strong> This status will cease and the status of “Cancelled” or “Withdrawn” will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Cancelled:</strong> This status is new. The term “Cancelled” means that the underlying listing agreement had been unconditionally released, meaning that any licensee may approach the homeowner/landlord in an effort to secure a new listing agreement. Only broker/owners, office managers, or office administrators of the brokerage may make this change in the MLS system. Agents of the broker will not be able to make this change, as the listing belongs to the broker, not the agent.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawn:</strong> This status is new. The term “Withdrawn” means the homeowner no longer desires the representation of the listing broker (a unilateral choice of the homeowner), thus the relationship between the homeowner and the listing broker has ended. The listing is no longer active; however, the underlying listing agreement is still conditionally in effect. As a part of this term “Withdrawn,” an “Obligation Date” will also be established. This “Obligation Date” is the date that the underlying listing contract ends. This date could be the natural expiration date of the listing agreement or it could be an earlier date agreed to by both the homeowner and the listing broker.</p>
<p>(Note: The “Obligation Date” cannot be a date later than the original expiration date unless an extension of the listing agreement is mutually entered into by the parties before the listing is “Withdrawn”). Again, only broker/owners, office managers or administrative assistants of the brokerage may make this change in the MLS system. Until that Obligation Date has passed, a prospective licensee may not directly contact the homeowner in an effort to list the property. After the “Obligation Date” passes, the listing will automatically change to “Expired” in the MLS system.</p>
<p><strong>Unchanged Status</strong></p>
<p>The following status identifiers will remain unchanged:</p>
<p><strong>Active:</strong> Listings that are available for showing and for purchase or rental.</p>
<p><strong>Expired:</strong> The underlying listing agreement’s “Expiration Date” (or “Obligation Date”) has passed and a prospective licensee is free to solicit the homeowner to list the property.</p>
<p><strong>Rented:</strong> A lease have been fully executed with no contingencies.</p>
<p><strong>Sold:</strong> Title has passed.</p>
<p><strong>Temporarily Off the Market:</strong> The listing is inactive, unavailable to show for a period of three (3) days or more. This status can remain indefinite or until the listing Expires.</p>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the status changes, other changes are taking place. These include:</p>
<p><strong>Expiration Date:</strong> Expiration dates will now be fully visible to all subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Facilitators:</strong> OneKey will have members that are designated as “Facilitators” to assist members in gaining access to properties or in presenting offers or obtaining proof that offers were presented. These Facilitators will be authorized to reach out directly to the listing agent and/or broker to assist in expediting matters. Failure to comply with a Facilitator’s requests may result in an automatic fine.</p>
<p><strong>LSC:</strong> This stands for “Last Status Change” and is similar to Matrix’s “Last Hotsheet Activity.” Activities will include: BOM (Back on Market), PC (Price Change), and EXT (Extended).</p>
<p><strong>New Fields:</strong> New fields will include:<br />
Obligation Date (as discussed above)<br />

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Although these changes are not earth shattering, they are important to know and understand. Failure to know or use these functions could certainly impact a member’s ability to act in the best interests of their clients, cooperate with other Realtors, and could even result in fines or Code of Ethics violations. As OneKey goes live, we will continue to update and review rules and regulations that are important to all our members.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[WRO charges in its litigation that individuals with mental disabilities were the subject of discrimination at Tor View Village The charges were based on a multi-year testing investigation conducted by White Plains-based WRO.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Non-profit fair housing agency Westchester Residential Opportunities, Inc. reported on March 9 it had filed suit against the ownership and manager of the 370-unit Tor View Village Apartments in Garnerville for alleged violations of federal, state and county fair housing laws.</p>
<p>WRO charges in its litigation that individuals with mental disabilities were the subject of discrimination at Tor View Village The charges were based on a multi-year testing investigation conducted by White Plains-based WRO.</p>
<p>During the investigation, WRO’s testers, who posed as prospective tenants, were informed by Tor View’s agents that their emotional support animal would not be accommodated at the property, in four instances and by three distinct agents. In particular, Tor View refused to make exceptions to its breed restrictions and pet fees for testers’ ESAs, which violates the law. Even when made aware that the animal would be providing relief for the prospective tenant’s mental illness, agents refused to accommodate, WRO states.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in federal court in White Plains and claims that the actions of the property ownership and management violated the Fair Housing Act, the New York State Human Rights Law and the Rockland County Fair Housing Law.</p>
<p>Berk-Cohen Associates owns and operates the 370-unit complex. Manhattan Management Company of Brooklyn is the management company for that complex. The ownership and management firm could not be reached for comment at press time.</p>
<p>In 2010, Tor View reached a settlement regarding allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice and Loeb House, a Pearl River-based non-profit provider of residential services to individuals with mental disabilities, that Tor View had refused to make reasonable accommodations to persons with mental disabilities. The federal government alleged that Tor View’s practices illegally restricted the right of individuals with mental illness to choose where to live.</p>
<p>In the settlement, Tor View denied it had violated the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p>WRO states that individuals with mental disabilities have a long history of unequal treatment and facing barriers to bare necessities, including housing, schooling and employment. Housing providers reduce housing opportunity through invasive questions, explicit refusals, accommodation denials and other forms of unfair treatment. The inability to find suitable housing is linked to a decline in mental, physical, social and economic well-being.</p>
<p>WRO Executive Director Marlene Zarfes said of the litigation filed against Tor View, “WRO is bringing this action to seek justice for people with disabilities. People with disabilities, whether mental or physical, are too often overlooked or stigmatized when it comes to housing opportunities. A successful outcome in this case will recognize the lawful rights of people with disabilities and expand housing opportunities for them, as intended by fair housing laws.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<h4>A Lifetime of Volunteering</h4>
<p>After spending 32 years working with the New York City Housing Authority, it’s no surprise that Amanda Martinez has a knack for finding people homes. The Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty agent actually started her real estate career just two years ago in the brokerage firm’s Goshen office, but has already made a name for herself not only in business, but in her volunteer work with the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation.</p>
<p>No stranger to volunteering over the years, Martinez has lent a helping hand to non-profit organizations like the Red Cross, Alzheimer’s Association and Pets Alive among others. Last year, she joined the HGRF’s Program Committee, which provides volunteers for the various events and activities to the charities and non-profits that the HGRF supports. “There is such a personal satisfaction in helping people and it makes us all feel good,” she said. “Sometimes that can be even more valuable than a paycheck.”</p>
<p>This year, Martinez is setting up volunteer activities at Hi-Tor Animal Shelter in Pomona and Habitat for Humanity of Greater Newburgh, and has added the Food Bank of the Hudson Valley in Cornwall-on-Hudson. In the past two years, Martinez has also been a staple at HGRF check presentations including for Hearts to Home, Catholic Charities, Center for Safety &amp; Change, Christ Church of Ramapo and Habitat for Humanity.</p>
<p>Martinez honed her volunteer skills while acting as an auxiliary officer with the New York City Police Department for 14 years. The volunteer position included helping with crowd control and making sure people were safe at large functions like parades and other events. “I wore a uniform, but didn’t carry a gun,” she explained. “I found it to be very rewarding.”</p>
<p>An animal lover, Martinez has been very active with Pets Alive in Middletown, helping to walk dogs, plan events and create gift baskets for fundraisers. She has two rescue dogs from there, and also worked with the organization’s “Trap-Neuter-Release” program for feral cats. “I’ve seen kittens outside my home and once I fed them, they decided to stay,” she recalled. “Of course, that wasn’t the plan, but that’s what happened.”</p>
<p>Born in Manhattan and growing up in the Bronx, Martinez came from a family of eight. She attended Fordham University, earning a B.S. in Psychology, and set her sights on becoming a therapist. Originally, she worked in the New York City family shelter system as a caseworker before transferring to the Housing Authority some 18 months later. She started out there as a social worker and quickly rose through the ranks to become a housing assistant, manager, translator, trainer and eventually, property manager.</p>
<p>As for her budding real estate career Martinez said it was a natural shift following the Housing Authority. “I was actually interested a long time ago and took classes, but I had to put everything on hold because I had just started a new job in a new department,” she said.</p>
<p>She made the move to Middletown in 2006, trading in a city lifestyle for a suburban one in the Hudson Valley. “Transitioning into real estate was fairly easy since I already knew about fair housing rules and regulations,” she said. “What was different—I was no longer reporting to an office every day. With the Housing Authority, you’re accountable to people above and below you—both managers and clients. But with real estate, you’re accountable to yourself because you’re running your own business.”</p>
<p>Martinez admits there have been some challenges. “I think I’ve already run into every negative situation, “she said. “Some people ended up buying houses with other agents even after signing with me, and there have been situations with the same family working with two agents. You just can’t control what people are going to do. You just hope they’re honest.”</p>
<p>To stay on top of things, Martinez believes in constant education and networking. “Real estate is definitely not a part-time job,” she added.</p>
<p>Most of her real estate clients are in the Orange County region and she loves the every-day diversity of her job. As for volunteering, Martinez plans to continue contributing to the foundation’s Program Committee. “I like where this is headed—getting everyone out there and providing help where it’s needed,” she said. “I also think people will donate more when they know where the funds are going, and it’s also a wonderful opportunity to give back.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>MONTGOMERY—One of the more controversial commercial projects in Orange County secured a key approval on March 8 that will likely facilitate groundbreaking on the $120-million distribution facility later this spring if building restrictions related to the Coronavirus are lifted.</p>
<p>The Montgomery Planning Board approved Medline Industries’ Final Environmental Impact Statement on its proposed 1.3-million-square-foot distribution facility. The Planning Board must now approve a findings statement for the project. Medline then must secure site plan approval before construction can commence.</p>
<p>If those approvals are obtained, a total of more than 2.3 million square feet of industrial warehouse space involving two projects will be under construction in Orange County, valued at more than $200 million.</p>
<p>Last month, Bluewater Property Group was granted approvals for incentives with the Montgomery Industrial Development Agency for its plan to build a 1,015,740-square-foot fulfillment center for Amazon that has been estimated to cost approximately $85 million to build.</p>
<p>Construction has already begun on the Amazon fulfillment center project.</p>
<p>Medline, a global healthcare products firm headquartered in Northfield, IL, is looking to move operations from Wawayanda where it has outgrown its 500,000-square-foot facility there. Medline has sold the Wawayanda site to Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Medline spokesman Jesse Greenberg said that Medline has committed to grow its workforce from 340 to 700 employees in five years.</p>
<p>“We are obviously very excited to have received our approval of our Final Environmental Impact Statement,” Greenberg said. “We have been working with the town for quite a long time in taking a lot of stakeholder input during that period and working with the community to make the project something that would benefit Medline and the community the best.”</p>
<p>He said Medline would be submitting to the town an acceptance letter of the FEIS with a final findings statement expected to be issued in early April. A meeting is scheduled on March 30 with the Planning Board in connection with the project.</p>
<p>The company had filed an application for incentives with the Montgomery Industrial Development Agency. Some Montgomery residents, as well as State Sen. James Skoufis criticized the award of any incentives for the Medline project.</p>
<p>At a hearing in August of 2019, Sen. Skoufis testified that the Planning Board should “make it clear to these folks that they need to get their hands out of the pockets of Montgomery residents. Our message should be loud and simple: ‘pay your damn taxes.’”</p>
<p>Some local officials were wary that Medline might abandon the project, but the firm subsequently withdrew its application with the Montgomery IDA. However, Medline expects to receive approximately $15 million in tax exemptions under New York State’s 485B program.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president and chief executive officer of the Orange County Partnership, praised Medline for “spending so much and being so patient through the approval process system in an effort to save their workforce and add new jobs to the community they love.”</p>
<p>She singled out the company’s ongoing commitment to Orange County, particularly during the ongoing coronavirus crisis. She noted that Medline “has stepped up and helped Orange County officials with ensuring that we have the supplies the county needs to protect our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halahan added, “This is a stellar company and it’s a privilege to have them here in Orange County.&#8221;</p>

    <description><![CDATA[On Jan. 28, 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) issued a new guidance (the “Guidance”) [see https://bit.ly/2TCFdFH] for housing providers to follow when determining whether to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to an individual seeking housing who is requ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A common issue that arises in connection with many residential lease negotiations and the occupancy of condominium units and cooperative apartments is where the individual seeking to occupy an apartment or unit requests a reasonable accommodation from a housing provider to allow for occupancy of a “service animal” or “assistance animal.” While many requests are legitimate, there are individuals who attempt to violate the law.</p>
<p>On Jan. 28, 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) issued a new guidance (the “Guidance”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2TCFdFH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2TCFdFH</a>] for housing providers to follow when determining whether to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to an individual seeking housing who is requesting that a “service animal” or “assistance animal” be permitted to occupy a particular premises. The 2020 Guidance replaces HUD’s previous guidance issued on April 25, 2013 (“2013 Guidance”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/39yrlSx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39yrlSx</a>] and provides a more useful tool for housing providers.</p>
<p><strong>‘Best Practices’ and ‘Clarity’ for Housing Providers</strong></p>
<p>The Guidance focuses on the obligations of housing providers under the Fair Housing Act and provides a set of “best practices” to be followed when assessing whether to grant a reasonable accommodation. The guidance provides housing providers with the types of information and documentation they should and are legally permitted to request from a disabled person. HUD’s goal is “to provide greater clarity” to and “reduce burdens” of housing providers, while at the same time provide important information to those individuals seeking housing who require assistance or support animals.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction between ‘Service’ and ‘Support’ Animals</strong></p>
<p>The guidance points out that “[t]here are two types of assistance animals: (1) service animals, and (2) other trained or untrained animals that do work, perform tasks, provide assistance, and/or provide therapeutic emotional support for individuals with disabilities (referred to in this guidance as a ‘support animal’).” If an animal does not qualify as either a service animal or a support animal, housing providers may treat that animal as a “pet” and would, therefore, be subject to established “pet policies,” lease provisions, co-op rules and regulations, and condominium homeowner’s association rules and regulations. A housing provider would be able to prohibit pets altogether, or, may charge a fee or deposit. It is important to note, however, that in New York, according to the new rental laws [see<a href="https://bit.ly/2xA6lth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/2xA6lth</a>] passed in June, 2019, a landlord is not permitted to charge a tenant a separate fee on account of a pet. A landlord is also prohibited from collecting a separate pet security deposit because the new law restricts a landlord from collecting any security deposit (whether a pet security deposit or general security deposit) that exceeds one month’s rent.</p>
<p><strong>Part I of the 2020 Guidance: ‘Service Animals’</strong></p>
<p>According to the Americans with Disabilities Act a “service animal” is defined as “…any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals for the purposes of this definition. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the individual&#8217;s disability.” While, the ADA provides that only a dog can be a service animal, other animals may be considered “assistance animals” provided they qualify and meet the criteria outlined in the guidance.</p>
<p>Part I of HUD’s Guidance provides a series of questions that can assist a housing provider, as well as the individual who intends to occupy the premises, to determine whether the animal is a service animal. If the animal is a dog then the housing provider must make two assessments: (1) whether it is readily apparent that the dog is trained to do work to assist the disabled individual, or (2) if it is not readily apparent, then the provider may make certain inquires of the disabled individuals and request reasonable information and documentation. It if is ultimately determined that the dog is not a “service animal” then it must be determined if the animal may qualify as a support animal.</p>
<p><strong>Part II of the 2020 Guidance: ‘Assistance Animals’</strong></p>
<p>If the animal is not a service animal (i.e., a service dog) under Part I, then the housing provider must proceed to Part II. Part II of the guidance provides the steps to be followed when making the analysis required under the FHA to assess whether a reasonable accommodation should be granted regarding an “assistance” or “support” animal.” Under the FHA “[a] reasonable accommodation is a change, exception, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be necessary for a person with a disability to have equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, including public and common use spaces.”</p>
<p>Part II of the guidance recommends the housing provider require any request for an assistance animal be made in writing, although not required under the FHA. HUD goes on to state that any individual requesting a reasonable accommodation should keep all records in the event there is ever a dispute. A request for reasonable accommodation can be made at any time where an individual acquires the assistance animal. However, the guidance points out that “…timing may create an inference against good faith on the part of the person seeking a reasonable accommodation,” if the individual makes the request only after a housing provider seeks to terminate the lease because of the presence of the animal or other reason. If the individual does not request a reasonable accommodation, then the housing provider does not have to grant it. However, if the request is made then the housing provider must follow the criteria set forth in Part III.</p>
<p><strong>Part III: Criteria for Granting a Reasonable Accommodation</strong></p>
<p>Part III provides a housing provider with a series of questions and guidelines that assist in determining whether or not to grant a reasonable accommodation. One factor is whether an individual has an “observable disability” or whether a housing provider or a provider’s agent has “information giving them reason to believe that the person has a disability.” If either of the above elements are true then the housing provider must determine whether “the person requesting the accommodation provided information which reasonably supports that the animal does work, performs tasks, provides assistance, and/or provides therapeutic emotional support with respect to the individual’s disability.”</p>
<p>If an individual provides information to establish that the animal is an assistance animal, a housing provider may include provisions in the lease that require the individual seeking the accommodation to make representations that the documentation is true and accurate, and that it could be deemed a default under the lease if the representations turn out to be untrue or inaccurate. If the provider determines that the information provided does not reasonably support that the animal meets the criteria above, then the provider may deny granting the reasonable accommodation. It is also important to note, however, that if the individual seeking the accommodation does not provide the information or delays in providing the information, a housing provider may not deny an accommodation unless the individual is provided a reasonable opportunity to deliver the required information or documentation.</p>
<p>One key issue, which has been the subject of much confusion and abuse, is the type of information or documentation that is legally sufficient or which an individual provides to a housing provider. The guidance provides that “reasonably supporting information often consists of information from a licensed health care professional —e.g., physician, optometrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse—general to the condition but specific as to the individual with a disability and the assistance or therapeutic emotional support provided by the animal.” The new guidance makes it much clearer that the housing provider now has the right to request more substantive documentation and information. An individual cannot get away with simply providing a certificate or some other document that is purchased or obtained over the Internet with no medical basis.</p>
<p><strong>Part IV: Types of Animals</strong></p>
<p>The guidance also provides clarification on the types of animals that are considered to be service animals and assistance animals. It distinguishes between those animals that are common household animals (i.e., non-commercial animals), such as “dog, cat, small bird, rabbit, hamster, gerbil, other rodent, fish, turtle, or other small, domesticated animal”, and “unique animals,” which are animals that are not commonly held in households (i.e., exotic or commercial animals). If the animal is a “unique animal” the individual seeking a reasonable accommodation has a substantial burden to establish that there is a “disability-related therapeutic need” for the animal. Nevertheless, even if the animal qualifies as an assistance animal, a housing provider may still “refuse a reasonable accommodation for an assistance animal if the specific animal poses a direct threat that cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level through actions the individual takes to maintain or control the animal (e.g., keeping the animal in a secure enclosure).”</p>
<p><strong>Part V: General Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The guidance also details additional general considerations which provide invaluable guidance. Some of these considerations include the following:</p>
<p>• Reasonable accommodation requests apply where Co-op Bylaws and/or Co-op Rules and Regulations, Condominium Homeowner’s Association rules, and land use or zoning laws are involved.</p>
<p>• Pet Rules or “Policies” do not apply when service and support animals are involved, but housing providers can impose certain restrictions if the animals pose a direct threat or physical alteration or damage.</p>
<p>• No deposit, surcharge or fee can be assessed where an assistance animal is involved, however, a charge can be assessed where the animal causes damage.</p>
<p>• Before a housing provider denies a request for reasonable accommodation, the housing provider must “engage in a good-faith dialogue” which is referred to as the “interactive process.”</p>
<p>• Any information received from an individual regarding health and disability conditions must be kept strictly confidential.</p>
<p>HUD’s guidance provides housing providers with critical guidance when assessing whether to grant a reasonable accommodation. This guidance will hopefully vet out any individual who is trying to take advantage of laws meant to protect those with disabilities. Real estate professionals, such as real estate agents and attorneys, representing housing providers should provide them with a copy of HUD’s Guidance.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[OneKey MLS offers real estate professionals more coverage, precise and accurate data. A consumer-facing website is set to launch in the coming weeks, officials with HGAR and LIBOR state.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK— The Long Island Board of Realtors, Inc. and the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. announced on March 24 that the first regional MLS for the New York Metro area—OneKey MLS—is now live for Realtor use.</p>
<p>OneKey MLS offers real estate professionals more coverage, precise and accurate data. A consumer-facing website is set to launch in the coming weeks, officials with HGAR and LIBOR state.</p>
<p>OneKey MLS is 44,000-plus subscribers strong and serves Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Orange, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. It was formed in 2018, following the merger of the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service and the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.</p>
<p>The creation of OneKey MLS represents a collaborative effort between the two Realtor Associations and their respective Multiple Listing Services to better support their members. To coincide with the launch, OneKey MLS is offering subscribers a Help Center on the site with vital information to ensure their success.</p>
<div id="attachment_31673" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BROKER-OWNER-PAGE-1-PIC.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31673" class=" wp-image-31673" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BROKER-OWNER-PAGE-1-PIC.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-31673" class="wp-caption-text">Top left: (Standing, from left) John Olivero; Ann Garti, HGAR COO; Richard Haggerty, HGAR CEO; Renee Zurlo, OneKey MLS Board of Managers, and Ron Garafalo, HGAR Past President. (Sitting, from left) Frank Dell&#8217;Accio, OneKey MLS Board of Managers; Jim Speer, OneKey MLS CEO; Leah Caro, Chair, OneKey MLS Board of Managers and Rey Hollingsworth</p></div>
<p>“We have a deep commitment to providing Realtors with a range of robust tools that will help them generate more income. This new regional MLS provides participants and subscribers the best services available,” said Jim Speer, CEO of OneKey MLS. “By providing</p>
<p>members easy access to real estate products and technology, we’re giving them the edge over the competition in their marketplace.”</p>
<p>The new MLS takes advantage of the powerful geography of the New York metropolitan area, giving Realtors unparalleled access to the most accurate listings in the market, he adds.</p>
<p>“We are committed to making this transition as easy as possible for our current and prospective members who are now utilizing the platform,” said Richard Haggerty, president of OneKey MLS and CEO of HGAR. “We have worked tirelessly to create an MLS that we hope will become the most trusted residential real estate data source and are thrilled Realtors are now able to experience it.”</p>
<p>Recognizing that real estate is about more than a transaction, for both consumers and brokers/agents, OneKey MLS goes beyond reliable, up-to-date property listings.

    <description><![CDATA[The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) issued by NYSAR effective at 5 p.m. on March 24 answered a host of questions covering general real estate activities in New York State.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The New York State Association of Realtors posted online the latest guidance regarding the regulations impacting the real estate industry in connection with Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive orders in connection with preventing the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/nysar.org/nysar-legal-lines-first-quarter-1364367?e=76038e3bd0&ref=realestateindepth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) issued by NYSAR</a></strong> effective at 5 p.m. on March 24 answered a host of questions covering general real estate activities in New York State.</p>
<p>One question that has arisen of late is whether real estate closings can take place and who can attend the closing. To that question the answer is ‘Yes.” However, marketing and other real estate activities are somewhat restricted.</p>
<p>In terms of real estate closings, NYSAR stated in its Legal Lines FAQ: “Yes. However, the only parties that could attend a closing are the seller, purchaser, seller attorney, purchaser attorney, lender attorney and title agent. According to the guidance document issued by the Governor as well as guidance issued by the Empire Development Corp., “Law firms and other providers of legal services are essential businesses only to the extent that their services are currently needed to support the essential functions of health care providers, utilities, state and local governments, the federal government, financial institutions, businesses that have been designated as essential; or to support criminal defendants in court proceedings or individuals in emergency family court proceedings; or to participate in proceedings concerning the imminent release or detention of individuals subject to criminal or civil detention under any applicable provision of state or federal law, or proceedings to address emergency risks to health, safety, or welfare.” As lawyers represent financial institutions at closings, they are deemed to be essential. It should be noted that remote notarization is now permissible under the Governor’s Executive Order 202.7. It is up to the aforementioned parties whether such remote notarization or other methods are used to avoid person to person contact.”</p>
<p>Below is the full FAQ issued by the New York State Association of Realtors issued to its members:</p>
<p>Dear NYSAR Members,</p>
<p>NYSAR is well aware of the disruption to your business because of the stay at home order for businesses that have not been deemed essential by the state. We have received many questions from our membership as to what real estate related activities are permissible. We are in contact with NYS and actively seeking answers to your questions.</p>
<p>Below is the most recent information regarding the most common questions that we have received. Please check back on NYSAR&#8217;s</p>
<p>dedicated COVID-19 webpage at nysarcovidupdates.com often. We will update this FAQ as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>We hope you and your family are healthy and safe. Rest assured that NYSAR is working full time to help our members to get through these unprecedented times.</p>
<p>This FAQ is effective as of 5:00pm on 3/24/2020 and supersedes any prior information provided by NYSAR.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to general licensed real estate activities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can licensees still take a listing?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. If you are listing the property but will not be interacting with the owner or public in-person, the licensee will not be violating the provisions of the mandate. The licensee will need to explain to the seller that until further notice, the licensee is unable to conduct in-person showings.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can a licensee perform in-person showings or in-person open houses?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. The Governor’s mandate is to prevent person-to-person contact. Furthermore, during his press conference the Governor specifically stated, “by my mandate you couldn’t even have your real estate agent showing the apartment. Same with commercial tenants.” Relying on the fact the real estate related activities are not deemed to be essential as well as the Governor’s statement, showings and open houses are not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are we allowed to list properties and post them as &#8220;unaccompanied showings only”?</strong></p>
<p>A: NYSAR is unable to provide guidance on this matter and has submitted a request to the State to have this activity deemed permissible. When NYSAR receives a response, members will be notified by e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are we allowed to do a virtual showing?</strong></p>
<p>A: NYSAR is unable to provide guidance on this matter and has submitted a request to the State to have this activity deemed permissible. When NYSAR receives a response, members will be notified by e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I go to a vacant home or vacant land to view it or take photographs for a listing?</strong></p>
<p>A: NYSAR is unable to provide guidance on this matter and has submitted a request to the State to have this activity deemed permissible. When NYSAR receives a response, members will be notified by e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is liability if a broker allows an agent from another broker to show property or violate the mandate in other ways?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Governor’s mandate is to prevent person-to-person contact. The listing agent should not permit showings where a licensee will be accompanying members of the general public. If the listing agent is permitting such showings, they may be liable as well. Penalties can range from a fine of $2,000, being charged with a misdemeanor and possible license suspension or revocation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What kind of marketing can I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: You may not make any unsolicited phone calls during a State of Emergency. General business Law §599-z(5)(a) states, “It shall be unlawful for any telemarketer doing business in this state to knowingly make an unsolicited telemarketing sales call to any person in a county, city, town or village under a declared state of emergency or disaster emergency as described in sections twenty-four or twenty-eight of the executive law.” All other types of marketing such as mailers, billboards, social media, internet etc. are permitted. You may call a FSBO if you have an identifiable purchaser interested in the property. You are prohibited from calling the FSBO to solicit the listing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am a single employee business; may I continue to perform licensed activities under the Governor’s mandate?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. The “single occupant/employee” exemption only relates to whether an application must be made if the business provides an essential function. During the press conference announcing the EO, the Governor specifically stated, “by my mandate you couldn’t even have your real estate agent showing the apartment. Same with commercial tenants.” The Governor’s statement can only be interpreted to mean that real estate-related activities such as in-person showings, open houses and in-person listing presentations are not an essential function or service. Since those activities are prohibited, the “single occupant/employee” exemption is not applicable. There are no exceptions or loopholes. You are not precluded from most work that you can accomplish from your home but you are prohibited from any in-person contact with clients/customers and other licensees.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are property managers an essential business?</strong></p>
<p>A: According to the guidance document, “Essential Services Necessary to Maintain the Safety, Sanitation and Essential Operations of Residences or Other Essential Businesses” are essential and include: building cleaners or janitors; general maintenance whether employed by the entity directly; and disinfection. The property manager should only staff the office with those employees necessary to perform those essential services while following all recommended health and safety precautions. Employees of the property manager should not be performing non-essential activities while in the office. According to the guidance document, “With respect to business or entities that operate or provide both essential and non-essential services, supplies or support, only those lines and/or business operations that are necessary to support the essential services, supplies, or support are exempt from the restrictions.”</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to property currently under contract:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Are appraisers and home inspectors deemed to be an essential business?</strong></p>
<p>A: NYSAR is unable to provide guidance on this matter and has submitted a request to the State to have this activity deemed permissible. When NYSAR receives a response, members will be notified by e-mail. NYSAR is aware that some lenders have been telling appraisers they are essential as they perform an essential function of the mortgage process but until definitive guidance is provided, this is only the opinion of the lender, not the State.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Notwithstanding the previous question, can I open the property for an appraiser or home inspector?</strong></p>
<p>A: NYSAR is unable to provide guidance on this matter and has submitted a request to the State to have this activity deemed permissible. When NYSAR receives a response, members will be notified by email.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can the purchaser be present during the inspection?</strong></p>
<p>A: The home inspector would need to assess any potential violation of the Governor’s mandate if the purchaser is present.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I conduct a final walkthrough with the purchaser?</strong></p>
<p>A: NYSAR is unable to provide guidance on this matter and has submitted a request to the State to have this activity deemed permissible. When NYSAR receives a response, members will be notified by e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to real estate closings:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Are closings permitted?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. However, the only parties that could attend a closing are the seller, purchaser, seller attorney, purchaser attorney, lender attorney and title agent. According to the guidance document issued by the Governor as well as guidance issued by the Empire Development Corp., “Law firms and other providers of legal services are essential businesses only to the extent that their services are currently needed to support the essential functions of health care providers, utilities, state and local governments, the federal government, financial institutions, businesses that have been designated as essential; or to support criminal defendants in court proceedings or individuals in emergency family court proceedings; or to participate in proceedings concerning the imminent release or detention of individuals subject to criminal or civil detention under any applicable provision of state or federal law, or proceedings to address emergency risks to health, safety, or welfare.” As lawyers represent financial institutions at closings, they are deemed to be essential. It should be noted that remote notarization is now permissible under the Governor’s Executive Order 202.7. It is up to the aforementioned parties whether such remote notarization or other methods are used to avoid person to person contact.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I attend a closing?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, unless your presence is essential to the completion of the closing. In other words, if you are not physically there, the closing could not occur. If your presence is required, you should only be in the closing room for as long as you are required and then leave while taking all health and safety precautions recommended by the government.</p>
<p><strong>Issues relating to the brokerage office:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What if my business is not essential, but a person must pick up the mail or perform a similar routine function each day?</strong></p>
<p>A: The ESD has determined that a single person attending a non-essential closed business temporarily to perform a specific task is permitted so long as they will not be in contact with other people. Other employees or licensees are prohibited from going to the office.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a $2-trillion COVID-19 compromise economic relief package on March 25. The bill now goes to the U.S. House, where it is expected to pass, and President Trump has said he will sign the much-needed measure into law.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors reports the bill includes $350 billion for the Small Business Administration 7(a) loan program. Under the terms, eligible businesses (500 employees or fewer) can get up to $10 million toward mortgage interest, rents, utilities and payroll costs. A portion of these loans will be forgivable.</p>
<p>“We worked with the drafters of this legislation to ensure that independent contractors and those living on a commission-based income will be eligible for the loans as well as the forgiveness provision,” said Shannon McGahn, senior vice president of government affairs for NAR.</p>
<p>The self-employed and independent contractors are also included in a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance that could provide benefits for up to 39 weeks. These workers are not usually covered under traditional state unemployment benefit programs.</p>
<p>In addition, the COVID-19 relief bill contains:</p>
<p>• A delay in payment of employer payroll taxes, with half due by the end of 2021 and the other half due by the end of 2022;</p>
<p>• $500 billion to support large businesses like airlines affected by the virus;</p>
<p>• A one-time payment of $1,200 to most adult Americans and $500 per child.</p>
<p>“This is the largest financial rescue package in our nation’s history,” McGahn continued. “Combined with two other relief packages that have already been signed into law and a likely fourth bill in the near future, this action represents a seismic and definitive action to help Americans and the economy through this national emergency.”</p>
<p>NAR will provide a complete analysis of the bill and how it affects Realtors Watch for regular updates at nar.realtor.</p>
<p>“We have worked closely with Congressional leaders and the administration during the past several weeks to ensure all three bills bring relief to the self-employed, independent contractors, and small businesses,” McGahn said. “The real estate industry is responsible for millions of jobs and is key to our national recovery.”</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) said the bill will deliver more than $40 billion to New York State.</p>
<p>“This is not a moment of celebration but rather one of necessity,” said Schumer. “The more than $40 billion of additional help on the way to New York is essential to save lives, preserve paychecks, support small businesses, and much more. These critical dollars will inject proverbial medicine into our state, city and localities throughout Upstate New York, to deliver much-needed resources, right now, that can help combat the coronavirus. Like all compromise legislation, this bill is far from perfect—but it now does much more for this state, its people and its future than what we began with.”</p>
<p>First, this relief package includes a dramatic and historic expansion and reform of the unemployment insurance program, something Schumer has called “Unemployment Insurance (UI) on steroids.” The extended and expanded UI program in the agreement increases the maximum unemployment benefit amount by $600 per week above one’s base unemployment compensation benefit and ensures that workers who are laid-off or out of work, on average, will receive their full pay for four months, a full quarter. It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for small, medium or large businesses, along with the self-employed and workers in the gig economy, who might travel from Upstate to work in the city each day. The $260-billion plan will deliver at least $15 billion directly to New York. Payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couple’s accounts for another $15.5 billion to New York.</p>
<p>The second major priority of Schumer’s negotiating was to deliver a Marshall Plan for hospitals and other medical facilities so they can provide necessary care during this pandemic. Schumer was able to create this plan and include over $150 billion for it nationally. Given the New York is the national epicenter of the pandemic, billions of dollars will begin flowing to New York right away. The money will be available to fund efforts critical to defeating the virus. That includes a massive new grant program for hospitals and health care providers, personal and protective equipment for health care workers, testing supplies, increased workforce and training, new construction to house patients, emergency operation centers and more. Additional funding is also dedicated to delivering Medicare payment increases to all hospitals and providers to ensure that they receive the funding they need during this crisis, and new investments in our country’s Strategic National Stockpile, surge capacity and medical research into COVID-19.</p>
<p>Third, Schumer, said he negotiated a special program to deliver relief to those entities, to help stabilize the ones hardest hit by the virus, like Westchester. An expenditure relief fund of roughly $150 billion dollars will deliver at least $7.5 billion to New York, with more than $168</p>
<p>million going to Westchester County, over $159 million headed towards Erie County, and more than $128 million for Monroe County.</p>
<p>Fourth, Schumer stated he also negotiated a small business rescue plan that allocates more than $375 billion to forgivable loans and grants to small businesses and non-profits so they can maintain their existing workforce and help pay other expenses during this crisis, like rent, a mortgage or utilities. The self-employed, independent contractors, and sole proprietors are eligible for assistance. New York, with its 2.2 million small businesses and tens-of-thousands of non-profits can expect to see billions of dollars once companies and organizations begin to apply for those funds. New York State small businesses that currently have more than 19,000 existing SBA loans will also have relief from the burden of paying those loans with a new policy of the SBA instead paying the principal, interest, and fees for a six-month period.</p>
<p>The bill also includes several “emergency appropriations” totaling $180 million that range from billions for hard-hit airports, expanded benefits to SNAP, increased CDBG which helps all our municipalities, funding for child care, of which New York would receive an additional $162 million, nutrition for seniors, nearly $1 billion to help heat homes when income becomes a problem, and $1.5 billion for the National Guard to support to the hardest hit States and territories, like New York where approximately 2,200 members of the National Guard have been activated, amongst other things. New York will see tens-of-billions from this account, as well, the Senator noted.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized the Senate bill and expressed hope that the House would make improvements to the proposal.</p>
<p>Communications Director for Gov. Cuomo Dani Lever released a statement on why the governor characterized the Senate bill as “terrible” for New York State.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on initial reports, New York State government gets approximately $3.1 billion. As a percent of our total state budget—1.9%—it is the second lowest amount in the nation. Literally 48 states get a higher percentage in funding than New York State. For example, South Dakota gets 17.9%. This is despite the fact that New York State is incurring the greatest costs as we have the highest number of cases in the country. New York State has 30 times the number of cases as Texas&#8217;s 1,031. The gross political manipulation is obvious. For example, Wyoming, which only has 40 confirmed COVID-19 cases, is getting 17.1 percent of their budget as a payment from the federal government.”</p>
<p>Lever added that New York State contributes more to the federal government than any other state. “It is just another case of politics over sound policy,” she stated.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—Days after Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced new restrictions on construction that all but shut down private construction in New York State, LEGOLAND New York Resort announced it was postponing its <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/commercial/legoland-new-york-resort-to-open-on-july-4-2020/">planned theme park opening on July 4th</a> until sometime in 2021.</p>
<p>On March 27, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced modifications to an existing executive order that temporarily shut down most major private development projects in the Hudson Valley and throughout the state. See story “Gov. Orders All Non-Essential Construction Shut Down” at RealEstateInDepth.com.</p>
<p>The amended restrictions shut down work on the theme park, but did not require construction on the approximately $40 million in road and bridge work adjacent to Route 17 to cease. Matt Besterman, public relations manager for LEGOLAND New York, told Real Estate In-Depth that the road infrastructure work will continue, but that work on the theme park and hotel components of the project have been shut down.</p>
<p>LEGOLAND New York and parent company Merlin Entertainments reported the opening postponement, which they stated in an announcement was consistent with the closure of venues and postponement of events worldwide and was based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and evolving restrictions from state and local governments in response to the Coronavirus Pandemic.</p>
<p>Besterman noted that the evolving Novel Coronavirus crisis was being monitored by the company, but the temporary closure of all non-essential construction by Gov. Cuomo caused the company to commence serious discussions that eventually led to the theme park opening’s postponement.</p>
<p>He added that the company cannot provide a firm definitive date in 2021 for the park’s opening due to the ever-changing nature of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>“Nothing is more important to us than the health, safety and security of our team, the partners we work with, and the communities we serve,” said LEGOLAND New York Resort Divisional Director Stephanie Johnson. “We are in an unprecedented situation that has affected businesses worldwide. By opening LEGOLAND New York Resort in 2021 we are building an attraction that not only meets our high standards, it also gives our guests the best possible experience.”</p>
<p>Resort officials said the resort still plans to hire more than 1,000 employees to staff the theme park and hotel, and all hourly employees who received an offer to work for the 2020 season will be invited to join the team in 2021.</p>
<p>All previously purchased annual passes or single-day tickets will be honored when the resort opens in 2021. Those who have booked vacation packages through LEGOLAND Vacations will be given the opportunity to be the first to book for the 2021 season, the company stated.</p>
<p>“We are grateful for the support and understanding from our guests and neighbors as we navigate the challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic,” Johnson said. “We look forward to building unforgettable memories with our guests and their families when we open in 2021.”</p>
<p>Johnson said the resort will continue to closely monitor the situation and communicate any updates via social media, email and its website.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Most private construction in New York State, including major development projects in New Rochelle, Yonkers and White Plains, have been temporarily shut down as a means to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus Pandemic.</p>
<p>At a press briefing at the Javits Center in New York City on March 27, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo modified an earlier executive order and mandated all non-essential construction work across the state to shut down immediately.</p>
<p>The order will mean the temporary shutdown of major mixed-use development projects in the Hudson Valley and other development projects, such as the theme park and hotel component of the LEGOLAND New York project currently under construction in Goshen.</p>
<p>The new restrictions do not halt all work at the LEGOLAND New York project, however.</p>
<p>Matt Besterman, public relations manager for LEGOLAND New York, released a statement in response to the new construction restrictions and their impact on the project: “Adhering to updated guidance issued this morning by New York State in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, LEGOLAND® New York Resort is pausing construction of its theme park and hotel until further notice. We will provide updates about our plans as we know more. The roadway and bridge construction in connection with the new Exit 125 on Route 17 is deemed essential by New York State and will continue.”</p>
<p>On March 31, LEGOLAND New York announced it was postponing its theme park opening date from July 4, 2020 to sometime in 2021.</p>
<p>The governor’s order describes essential construction to include: public and private utilities including but not limited to power generation; fuel supply and transmission; public water and wastewater; telecommunications and data centers; airports/airlines; commercial shipping vessels/ports and seaports; transportation infrastructure such as bus, rail, for-hire vehicles, garages; hotels, and places of accommodation</p>
<p>The state also relates that essential construction work that may continue also includes projects involving: roads, bridges, transit facilities, utilities, hospitals or health care facilities, affordable housing and homeless shelters.</p>
<p>Operating under the designation as an essential business as modified by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, work crews continue to press forward with infrastructure renewal and environmental protection projects in the downstate New York region, according to construction industry trade organization The Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc. based in Tarrytown.</p>
<p>While certain projects have been slowed or delayed due to staffing shortages, contracting employers and organized labor leaders are hopeful key personnel and crews can continue to deliver on public projects, the CIC stated.</p>
<p>“Construction work is continuing and we’re taking every precaution to ensure everyone is safe, protected and productive,” said John Cooney, Jr., executive director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc. “Crews are showing up fit for duty and public agencies are planning to continue with bid lettings for projects, even as work-arounds to accommodate social distancing are ironed out.”</p>
<p>The CIC added that contractors are revising protocols to keep workers and the public safe and to mitigate coronavirus transmission. Cooney described the manner in which the industry is working as “uber-attentive” to changing conditions. “We have safety protocols on projects and in jobsite trailers like I’ve never witnessed in my 40 years of working in construction.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Commercial and residential real estate brokers and agents received some welcome if not surprising news on April 1 when the Empire State Development Corp. clarified existing regulations<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/gov-cuomo-puts-states-real-estate-industry-on-pause-to-prevent-further-spread-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">,</a> put in place in response to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic, and deemed residential and commercial showings and back office real estate work as “essential.”</p>
<p>The clarification therefore allows those facets of the real estate business to resume, according to an announcement by the New York State Association of Realtors release last night (April 1).</p>
<p>The ESD’s clarifications, which went into effect immediately, also deemed appraisal services and home inspections as essential.</p>
<p>Essential businesses must continue to comply with the guidance and directives for maintaining a clean and safe work environment issued by the Department of Health and every business, even if essential, is strongly urged to maintain social distance to the extent possible, NYSAR noted.</p>
<p>Back-office real estate work is deemed essential, but NYSAR recommends firms utilize telecommuting or work from home procedures to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p>“Our industry has been given a great responsibility in this time of crisis to help meet the needs of New York’s residential and commercial property buyers and owners, and the overall welfare of the local and state economy,” said NYSAR President Jennifer Stevenson. “But our priority must be to the safety of our customers, clients and indeed for ourselves, as we all continue to practice socially responsible distancing that is helping to flatten the curve during this national health crisis. Our mantra must be ‘safety first, work second.’”</p>
<p>NYSAR officials state that the clarification of the designations is a recognition by the state that real estate licensees, real estate home inspectors and real estate appraisers “provide a critical service to New York, which is vital to the wellbeing not only of New Yorkers but also for New York’s local and state economy.”</p>
<p>However, as affected businesses resume operations that were all but shut down by <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/gov-cuomo-puts-states-real-estate-industry-on-pause-to-prevent-further-spread-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s prior orders</a>, NYSAR reminds all its members that they must fully comply with governor’s “New York State on PAUSE” directive, which states that “essential businesses must continue to comply with the guidance and directives for maintaining a clean and safe work environment issued by the Department of Health and every business, even if essential, is strongly urged to maintain social distance to the extent possible.”</p>
<p>The real estate industry, except for those undertaking limited virtual business, was all but shut down by <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/gov-cuomo-puts-states-real-estate-industry-on-pause-to-prevent-further-spread-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo effective 8 p.m. Sunday, March 22</a> in an attempt to prevent the further spread of the Coronavirus.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[On the evening of April 2, an official with Empire State Development Corp. in a clarification of the designation of real estate as an “essential” industry, stated that all showings must be conducted virtually or online in order to prevent the spread of the Novel Coronavirus.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Less than 24 hours after the real estate industry was led to believe that in-person real estate showings were permitted by New York State comes a statement from Empire State Development that only virtual/online showings are permissible.</p>
<p>On the evening of April 2, an official with Empire State Development Corp. in a clarification of the designation of real estate as an “essential” industry, stated that all showings must be conducted virtually or online in order to prevent the spread of the Novel Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Matthew Gordon, executive vice president, public affairs and communications for ESD, stated, “Being an &#8216;essential&#8217; industry does not mean business as usual—business can only be conducted if social distancing and other public health protocols are followed and all must be doing everything they can to help stop the spread. For real estate, that means brokers can only transact business in their offices or show properties virtually, and anything else is off limits.”</p>
<p>He added that appraisers/inspectors are able to visit properties for inspection. Brokers can oversee transactions/signings at their offices while following social distancing protocols.</p>
<p>The confusion concerning what was allowed and what was impermissible in terms of real estate showings arose when a day earlier commercial and residential real estate brokers and agents received some welcome if not surprising news when the Empire State Development Corp. clarified existing regulations, put in place in response to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic, and deemed residential and commercial showings and back office real estate work as “essential.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/commercial/breaking-news-empire-state-development-deems-some-facets-of-residential-commercial-real-estate-as-essential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The ESD’s clarifications released by the New York State Association of Realtors on April 1 also deemed appraisal services and home inspections as essential</a>.</p>
<p>“Our industry has been given a great responsibility in this time of crisis to help meet the needs of New York’s residential and commercial property buyers and owners, and the overall welfare of the local and state economy,” said NYSAR President Jennifer Stevenson. “But our priority must be to the safety of our customers, clients and indeed for ourselves, as we all continue to practice socially responsible distancing that is helping to flatten the curve during this national health crisis. Our mantra must be ‘safety first, work second.’”</p>
<p>NYSAR officials stated that the clarification of the designations is a recognition by the state that real estate licensees, real estate home inspectors and real estate appraisers “provide a critical service to New York, which is vital to the wellbeing not only of New Yorkers but also for New York’s local and state economy.”</p>
<p>NYSAR sent an e-mail to its members on April 3 noting the latest clarification by the state and noted, “NYSAR interprets ‘virtual’ to mean no in-person contact when conducting a showing. Licensees should conduct the showing alone and use a tool such as video conferencing with the buyer or tenant. The goal of the new standard is to further limit the possibility of one on one contact which NYSAR strongly supports.”</p>
<p>NYSAR stated it is in contact with ESD and was informed that more comprehensive guidance will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>“NYSAR recommends that members act in good faith to follow the ‘virtual’ standard as reported until state officials offer more clarity. “The state approved activity for real estate licenses under the Executive Order is constantly evolving and NYSAR members should expect further clarification from state officials during the State of Emergency,” NYSAR stated.</p>
<p>NYSAR added that the ESD guidance extremely limits what real estate functions are deemed essential for the purpose of licensee and public safety and urges Realtors work from home to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>While the April 1 clarification initially opened up some facets of the bricks and mortar real estate industry that were shuttered by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo effective 8 p.m. Sunday, March 22 in an attempt to prevent the further spread of the Coronavirus, the reaction to the clarification was mixed and mostly guarded from real estate industry leaders due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the pandemic.</p>
<p>HGAR President Gail Fattizzi said after Empire State Development clarified regulations that now allow only virtual property showings, “I think limiting to virtual showings is absolutely the correct thing to do at this juncture. The overwhelming sentiment I heard from our members in their feedback to the first EDC announcement was not in favor of resuming in-person showings at this time. In weighing risk vs. reward, there&#8217;s no question that health and safety firmly come before business.”</p>
<p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty reiterated the message HGAR previously sent to members: &#8220;We firmly believe that our number one priority remains containing and ultimately defeating COVID-19. We need to be unwavering in that commitment and do everything within our power to help that effort. The economy and the real estate market will not find sound footing until that priority is achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the clarification now in place that only allows virtual/online property showings, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors will be providing updates, including a Facebook event that will be available soon on HGAR’s Facebook page that addressed the latest ESD ruling, Fattizzi noted.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[According to a report released by OneKey Multiple Listing Service earlier this month, that aforementioned assumption has, of course, been cast in doubt by the onset of COVID-19, which has, in the space of a matter of weeks, significantly impacted the local economy and unemployment numbers.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Residential home sales figures for the first quarter of 2020 were strong and indicated that a robust year for residential sales in the lower Hudson Valley region, now served by OneKey Multiple Listing Service, would follow.</p>
<p>According to a<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-1st-Qtr-2020-Real-Estate-Market-Report-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report released by OneKey Multiple Listing Service </a>earlier this month, that aforementioned assumption has, of course, been cast in doubt by the onset of COVID-19, which has, in the space of a matter of weeks, significantly impacted the local economy and unemployment numbers.</p>
<p>Single-family residential units were the stars of the show for the first quarter, registering solid gains across the board with the exception of Orange County where a dearth of inventory has been plaguing sales for the previous two quarters.</p>
<p>Westchester County experienced a 7.2% increase in single-family home sales with 1,055 sales compared with 984 sales in the first quarter of 2019. Rockland County had a double digit increase of 15% with sales at 452 units compared to 393 units in the first quarter of 2019. Putnam County sales were up 8.7% at 224, Sullivan County single-family sales rose 6.1% at 209 units and Bronx County (not officially a OneKey service area) had an increase of 6% at 123 single-family unit sales. Orange County sales dropped 3.5% to 737 sales from 764 sales for the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>The median sales price (the point that indicates the exact middle of the market) was up for single-family homes in all counties. Ironically, Orange County’s median sales price saw an 11.2% increase going from $250,00 in the first quarter of 2019 to $277,900 in Q1-2020. This would support the premise that there is a relationship between lack of inventory and lower sales in Orange. The median sales price increased by 6.7% to $640,000 in Westchester, 2.4% to $335,00 in Putnam, 3.1% to $459,00 in Rockland, 25.8% to $163,500 in Sullivan and 7.8% to $520,000 in Bronx County.</p>
<p>Condominium unit sales did not fare as well as the single-family sector with the exception of Putnam County where sales rose to 33 units from 24 in 2019 (up 37.5%) and Bronx County where sales increased to 44 units from 34 in 2019 (up 29.4%). Orange saw sales of 86 units down from 117 a year earlier and Westchester at 233 units was down from 258 units in 2019 while prices increased in both counties.</p>
<p>Westchester, which has a significant co-op market, continued to see a decline in sales in that sector. There were 378 units sold compared to 448 units in the first quarter of 2019. That being said, the median price of a co-op unit rose 3.3% to $175,500 from $169,950 in the first quarter of 2019. Multi-family units were up in Orange, Rockland and Sullivan counties, while down in Westchester and Bronx counties. Still, prices increased in all five areas.</p>
<p>Based on employment numbers, commercial activity, interest rates, tourism development and infrastructure projects, it is normally reasonable to predict what market conditions for housing in the lower Hudson Valley will be for the year ahead. That criteria has served us well in the past. At this juncture however, we can only hope the healthy base we experienced at the beginning of the year will facilitate a strong path back to “normal” sooner than later.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[GDC purchased the property in Northwest Yonkers from Stamford, CT developer Randy Salvatore’s RMS Companies who completed the building last year. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>YONKERS—Ginsburg Development Companies has added to its portfolio of multifamily properties in the Greystone section of Yonkers with the recent purchase of the Stratus on Hudson, a 74-unit luxury rental building located at 1077 Warburton Ave.</p>
<p>GDC purchased the property in Northwest Yonkers from Stamford, CT developer Randy Salvatore’s RMS Companies who completed the building last year.</p>
<p>A report in the <em>Westchester County Business Journal</em> stated the sale price of the property was $39.5 million.</p>
<p>“GDC has a lot of history in the Greystone area going back to the 1960s and have built six projects in this community. Our River Tides and 1177@Greystone luxury rental buildings are recent additions to the Greystone neighborhood, which has become a premier residential neighborhood in Westchester County. Randy Salvatore built a building that meets the high-quality brand standards of GDC Rentals, so it was a natural fit for our portfolio,” said GDC Principal Martin Ginsburg.</p>
<p>The CBRE team of Jeffrey Dunne, Gene Pride, Jeremy Neuer, David Gavin, Steven Bardsley and Eric Apfel represented the owner, RMS Companies, in the sale to Ginsburg Development Companies.</p>
<p>Stratus on Hudson features a rooftop sun deck with lounge seating, an outdoor bar, wide screen television, and views of the Hudson River looking up and down the river toward the New York City skyline. Other amenities include a club lounge party room with billiards, a fitness center, indoor garage parking and a location that offers a three-minute walk to the Greystone Metro-North station.</p>
<p>GDC will offer Stratus residents access to The Spa at River Tides and other programming offered at the larger 330-unit full-service building.</p>
<p>The apartments at Stratus feature 9’6” ceilings with eight-foot panoramic windows with many river views; LVT plank flooring with herringbone pattern carpeting in bedrooms; designer kitchens with stainless steel appliances, high gloss grey and white cabinets and quartz countertops; large walk-in closets; a washer and dryer in every unit and spa-inspired bathrooms with glass shower enclosures.</p>
<p>“With the addition of Stratus, GDC now offers a variety of lifestyle choices in Greystone from our large full-service River Tides building with a swimming pool, to the midsize Stratus with a spectacular roof deck, to our small boutique building 1177 @Greystone with a dramatic sunset deck. Each property in its own distinct way delivers on GDC’s brand promise of “Come home to vacation,” added Ginsburg.</p>
<p>Stratus marks the 10th property owned by various GDC entities and managed by GDC Rentals. In addition to Stratus, River Tides and 1177, the properties include The Lofts on Saw Mill River in Hastings-on-Hudson, The Metro in GDC’s City Square complex in White Plains, Harbor Square in Ossining, Fort Hill Apartments in Peekskill, The Landing on Mohegan Lake, and Parkside and Riverside on the Hudson River in Haverstraw.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[field_563938efa5894]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Today I’m writing from my makeshift office, looking out on the world that has changed drastically since my last article. So much has happened in a few short weeks and there is so much uncertainty for the weeks ahead. However, there are a few things that remain certain and it is these things that I would like to touch upon this month’s article. Those things are: (1) the state of emergency rules on cold calling; (2) the application of “Clear Cooperation” starting on May 1, 2020; and (3) the new “Coming Soon” status in OneKey MLS.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibition On Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>General Business Law §399-z(5-a) provides as follows:</p>
<p><em>“It shall be unlawful for any telemarketer doing business in this state to knowingly make an unsolicited telemarketing sales call to any person in a county, city, town or village under a declared state of emergency or disaster emergency as described in sections twenty-four or twenty-eight of the executive law.”</em></p>
<p>With Executive Order 202, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency on March 7, 2020. That state of emergency will continue until September 7, 2020, unless extended or otherwise modified.</p>
<p>As a result:</p>
<p>• A Realtor CANNOT solicit listings by telephone if there is no prior relationship;</p>
<p>• A Realtor CANNOT solicit a marketed “for sale by owner” property to list the property;</p>
<p>• A Realtor MAY call a “for sale by owner” property if they have an identifiable purchaser interested in the property;</p>
<p>• Realtor CANNOT contact expired listings, off market listings, canceled listings or withdrawn listings unless there is a pre-existing relationship between the homeowner and the Realtor.</p>
<p>All other types of communication are still permissible, meaning that a Realtor may continue to market themselves and their business through traditional methods such as mailers, billboards, social media, internet, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>In November 2019, NAR’s Board of Directors approved MLS Statement 8.0, otherwise known as the “Clear Cooperation” policy. Clear Cooperation will be adopted by OneKey MLS on May 1, 2020.</p>
<p><em>Section 1.01 – Clear Cooperation:</em></p>
<p><em>“Within one (1) business day of marketing a property to the public, the listing broker must submit the listing to the MLS for cooperation with other MLS participants.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Public marketing includes, but is not limited to, flyers displayed in windows, yard signs, digital marketing on public facing websites, brokerage website displays (including IDX and VOW), digital communications marketing (email blasts), multi-brokerage listing sharing networks, and applications available to the general publ</em>ic.”</p>
<p>This advertising applies to all listings, active and non-active, including “Temporarily Off The Market,” “Canceled,” “Withdrawn” and “Coming Soon” listings.</p>
<p><em>Section 1.3 Exempt Listings:</em></p>
<p><em>“If the seller refuses to permit the listing to be disseminated by the service, the participant may then take the listing (office exclusive) and such listing shall be filed with the service but not disseminated to the participants. Filing of the listing should be accompanied by certification signed by the seller that he does not desire the listing to be disseminated by the service.”</em></p>
<p>It’s important to note that office exclusives are an important option for sellers concerned about their privacy and wide exposure of their property being for sale (for example, celebrities, divorce situations, etc.). In the office exclusive situation, an agent may directly promote the listing between brokers and agents affiliated with the listing brokerage, as well as one-to-one promotion between the agent and their clients, as this is not considered public advertising.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that if an office exclusive is marketed to the public in any way, then the listing, pursuant to Section 1.01, must be submitted to the MLS within (1) one business day after the listing is publicly marketed.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with Clear Cooperation rules will result in a fine of $2,500.</p>
<p><strong>“Coming Soon” Designation</strong></p>
<p>Also effective May 1, 2020 is the new status of “Coming Soon.” OneKey Rules and Regulations states:</p>
<p><em>302.3 “Coming Soon &#8211; No Showings” Status</em></p>
<p><em>“a. Purpose. The purpose of the “Coming Soon &#8211; No Showings” status (or “Coming Soon”) is to allow a short period of time in order to prepare a property for showings, after which time the listing will become fully Active and available for showings. During the “Coming Soon” period the seller and listing broker may not promote, market or advertise the property in any manner other than as provided in this Rule 302.3. All other MLS Rules shall apply to Coming Soon listings, as appropriate, and violations of these “Coming Soon” Rules shall be subject to the Rules Enforcement provisions of Section 9, herein.”</em></p>
<p>In order to permit a listing to be designated as “Coming Soon”, the owner must provide specific, written instructions that they wish to have the property identified as “Coming Soon.” A “Coming Soon” property is entitled to this status for a maximum of 14 days. After 14 days, its status will automatically change to “Active.” If, at that time, the property is not ready to be placed Active, then the agent can place the property “Temporarily Off The Market.”</p>
<p>While the status of the property is “Coming Soon,” it will be displayed on the MLS system and on IDX/VOX websites/mobile apps. It will not be syndicated to such websites as Realtor.com, RPR, the Zillow Group, Homes.com, ListHub, etc.</p>
<p>“Coming Soon” properties will only be allowed on the following websites and there must be a notice stating that the property is “Coming Soon,” along with the date that the property will come on the market:</p>
<p>• The listing broker’s website, including client portals;</p>
<p>• On other broker websites via IDX/VOW, including client portals;</p>
<p>• Social media posts; and</p>
<p>• Any website of the MLS.</p>
<p>Additionally, the property may be marketed as follows:</p>
<p>• Placing of a sign on the property stating “Coming Soon;”</p>
<p>• Printed flyer stating “Coming Soon” with the date it will come on the market; and/or</p>
<p>• By e-mail to the listing broker’s current clients and customers, stating that it is “Coming Soon” with the date it will come on the market.</p>
<p>What is important to understand is that while the status of a property is “Coming Soon,” it cannot be shown to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Cold calling, Clear Cooperation, and “Coming Soon” are three very important rules to understand. Take the time to learn them while you are working from home. While none of us own a crystal ball that we can look into to predict the future, we do know that some things will inevitably come to pass. Someday soon we will be back at work. We will be listing and selling homes and well need to know these rules. And, hopefully, in the very near future, we will be breathing in the fresh air, gathering and laughing with friends and colleagues (at a distance closer than six feet), and we will all look back on this and be all the wiser for it. Stay safe.</p>

The most significant of these measures was the passage of the $2-trillion rescue package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On March 7, 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for New York State [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/34jIVI4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/34jIVI4</a>]. On March 13, 2020, President Trump then declared a national state of emergency [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2JMNC3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2JMNC3N</a>]. Since then, many have lost their lives to the COVID-19 virus. Additionally, many of the nation’s non-essential businesses have been forced to shut down operations, layoff or furlough employees and/or have their employees work from home.</p>
<p>Congress and the Federal Reserve have taken unprecedented measures with respect to monetary policy and the passage of stimulus and rescue packages. [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2RgfmSs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2RgfmSs</a>]. The most significant of these measures was the passage of the $2-trillion rescue package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/39OJU4k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39OJU4k</a>].</p>
<p><strong>The CARES Act:</strong><br />
<strong> Assistance for Small Businesses, Sole Proprietorships</strong><br />
<strong> and Independent Contractors</strong></p>
<p>The focus of the CARES Act is to provide broad based assistance to families, individuals and businesses. While the act’s scope is expansive, this article will focus on (1) the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan Program”) under Section 1102 of the Act and (2) the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program (the “PUA Program”) established under Section 2102 of the Act [see also “Unemployment Insurance Program Letter issued on April 5, 2020 at <a href="https://bit.ly/2xUYB8A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2xUYB8A</a>].</p>
<p>All small businesses, employees, independent contractors, and sole proprietors, including Realtors and real estate brokerage firms, should research all of these programs and determine which one is right for them. Both of the above programs, as well as other programs (e.g., SBA EIDL Loan) and assistance contained in the CARES Act, are each unique and provide different types of aid. While the PPP Loan Program provides loans to eligible businesses and individuals that may be fully forgiven, the PUA Program may offer independent contractors, particularly Realtors, who have historically been unable to apply for the unemployment insurance, benefits and economic relief not available under the PPP Loan Program.</p>
<p><strong>The PPP Loan Program:</strong><br />
<strong> Eligible Businesses, Sole Proprietors and Independent Contractors</strong></p>
<p>On April 3rd, lenders began accepting loan applications under the PPP Loan Program from small businesses. As of April 7th, more than 200,000 applications had been submitted. Congress also announced that an additional $250 billion could be added to the $350 billion already allocated under the CARES Act due to the high demand. The SBA issued the Interim Final Rule (the “PPP Rule”) detailing the requirements of the program [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3e2A7L3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3e2A7L3</a>].</p>
<p>On April 10th, lenders started accepting PPP Loan applications from independent contractors, including Realtors, sole proprietors and individuals that are self-employed.</p>
<p>The PPP Loan Program is 100% guaranteed by the SBA and the full principal amount of the loans may qualify for forgiveness provided the loan proceeds are utilized for payroll and other qualified expenses (discussed below). Seventy-five percent of the total loan amount must be used for payroll expenses and the remaining 25% must be used for other qualified expenses. The interest rate on PPP Loans will be 1% and payments will be deferred for the first six months. If the loan qualifies for forgiveness, then no repayment will be required. For any amount that is not forgiven, the PPP Loan will have a two-year repayment term. As of now, borrowers seeking a PPP Loan should contact the bank with which they have their business banking relationship.</p>
<p><strong>PPP Loan Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>To be eligible, businesses must have less than 500 employees and have or had W-2 employees on payroll or have paid independent contractors (as reported on Form 1099-Misc). Independent contractors, sole proprietors or self-employed individuals, including Realtors and gig workers, are also eligible to apply for a PPP Loan beginning on April 10th. All applicants must have been in business on or before Feb. 15, 2020.</p>
<p>The CARES Acts allows lenders to rely on documentation submitted and certain certifications made by the borrower in order to approve a loan application. The following are some of the certifications required to be made by an applicant:</p>
<p>• The applicant must have employed W-2 salaried employees and paid payroll taxes for those employees.</p>
<p>• The applicant paid independent contractors, as reported on Form 1099-MISC.</p>
<p>• That the current economic uncertainty makes the loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant.</p>
<p>• The funds will be used to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest payments, lease payments and utility payments.</p>
<p>• The applicant must certify that he/she/it has not and will not receive another loan under PPP Loan Program.</p>
<p>The applicant must also agree to submit documentation, for the eight-week period following the loan approval, verifying the number of full-time equivalent employees on payroll and total payroll costs. The borrower must also submit documents substantiating other covered expenses, such as mortgage interest payments, rent payments and utilities.</p>
<p>The borrower must certify that any information provided to the lender is accurate in all material respects. If the borrower makes any false statements when applying for the PPP Loan the borrower could be subject to imprisonment ranging from two to 30 years and/or fines ranging from $5,000 to $1 minion.</p>
<p><strong>How to Determine the Loan Amount for PPP Loan</strong></p>
<p>In order to determine the PPP Loan amount, businesses must determine what the full payroll costs are for all employees. The number of employees of a business are calculated by adding all individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis. These businesses may not include independent contractors paid by them in the employee count. <em><strong>Independent contractors must apply for a PPP loan on their own.</strong></em></p>
<p>In order to qualify for the loan, applicants are required to provide the following documentation to the lender: (1) payroll processor records; (2) payroll tax filings; (3) 1099- MISC Forms, and/or (4) income and expenses from a sole proprietorship. For those individuals or businesses that do not have any of the above information they must provide bank statements or “other supporting documentation” that substantiates the “qualifying payroll amount.”</p>
<p><strong>The PPP Loan Amount Formula and Covered Expenses</strong></p>
<p>An applicant must calculate what the full payroll costs are for the previous 12-month period and divide that amount by 12 months. Once the average monthly payroll cost is calculated, that amount is then multiplied by 2.5. This provides the applicant with two full months of payroll costs plus an additional 25% for other covered costs, such as group health care benefits, mortgage interest payments (not including principal payments), rent payments, utility payments and interest payments on any other debt obligations incurred prior to Feb. 15, 2020.</p>
<p>“Payroll costs” for eligible businesses consist of salaries, wages, commissions, or similar compensation, tips, vacation pay, parental, family, medical, or sick leave pay, allowance for separation or dismissal; payment of employee benefits (e.g. group health care coverage, insurance premiums, and retirement), and payments of state and local taxes assessed on compensation of employees. For independent contractors or sole proprietors, “payroll costs” include the following types of compensation: “wages, commissions, income, or net earnings from self-employment or similar compensation.”</p>
<p><strong>Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) Program</strong></p>
<p>For many, the PPP Loan Program may not be the right option. Under the PUA Program, individuals who do not qualify for regular unemployment compensation and are unable to continue working as a result of COVID-19, such as self-employed workers, independent contractors, including Realtors, and gig workers, are now eligible for unemployment benefits. However, affected individuals may only seek benefits under either the PPP Loan Program or the PUA Program, not both. The PUA Program will be administered by the individual states. New York State provides detailed information on its website [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2y22Lvf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2y22Lvf</a>].</p>
<p>These individuals would now be eligible for unemployment benefits for up to 39 weeks (which includes an additional 13 weeks through Dec. 31, 2020) under the CARES Act provided they certify that they are unemployed, partially unemployed, or unavailable or unable to work because of COVID-related issues, which include, among others, an individual being diagnosed with or is experiencing symptoms, an individual&#8217;s family member has been diagnosed with or is providing care for a family member who has been diagnosed with COVID-19; a child or other person in the household is unable to attend school or another facility due to COVID-19 closures; and/or an individual is unable to reach the place of employment because of a mandated quarantine.</p>
<p>The additional 13 weeks of unemployment compensation apply so long as the individual: (1) has no rights to regular unemployment compensation under any applicable state or federal law, (2) is not receiving unemployment compensation under Canadian law, and (3) is able, available, and actively seeking work. Further, New York State provides that if an individual can telework, receives paid sick leave or receives paid leave benefits, he or she would not be eligible to receive PUA benefits. An individual may also be eligible to receive an additional $600 per week in federal benefits in addition to the state’s unemployment benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Seek Advice Before Choosing a Path</strong></p>
<p>There are many benefits and programs available under the CARES Act. It is of utmost importance that individuals and businesses seek the advice of their legal, banking and accounting professionals before committing to a particular program. These are certainly difficult times, but everyone working together will get through this. The important thing is that everyone be safe and stay healthy.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—In nearly a month of difficult economic news and tragic fatality numbers due to the Novel Coronavirus pandemic, a glimmer of hope has emerged that the state is beginning to consider how and when non-essential businesses could reopen in New York State.</p>
<p>On Monday April 13, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a regional initiative with six other Northeast states to begin to study how and in what fashion they could re-start their respective economies in a collaborative fashion. Non-essential businesses in New York State have been shuttered since Gov. Cuomo put the state “on pause” on March 22.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo reported that the state has likely reached or is approaching the worst of the COVID-19 epidemic thanks to the stay-at-home measures that were put in place to prevent the spread of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I believe the worst is over if we continue to be smart,” the governor told reporters. “And I believe we can now start on the path to normalcy, and we can have a plan where you start to see some businesses reopening, understanding the delicate balance.”</p>
<p>Also, on April 13, although President Donald Trump said that he has the power to order states to have businesses open their doors from state-ordered shutdowns, three governors of Western states announced they would also work cooperatively to study how and when they would restart their economies. President Trump shortly thereafter walked back his assertions regarding federal powers over states.</p>
<p>The Northeast COVID-19 initiative was announced at a press conference in Albany on Monday led by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Other participants included New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Delaware Gov. John Carney, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo. Shortly after the teleconference, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker reported Massachusetts would join the now seven-state coalition as well.</p>
<p>The governors stressed that the council, which will be comprised of one health expert, one economic development expert and the respective Chief of Staff from each state, will work together to develop a fully integrated regional framework to gradually lift the states’ stay at home orders while minimizing the risk of increased spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The council will create the framework using every tool available to accomplish the goal of easing social isolation without triggering renewed spread. Those tools will include testing, contact tracing, treatment and social distancing and will rely on the best available scientific, statistical, social and economic information to manage and evaluate those tools, state officials said.</p>
<p>All stressed that while they want to restart their economies sooner rather than later, health care considerations would drive how and when their economies would re-emerge from shutdown. While there was no set timeline on when the council would issue its recommendations, Gov. Cuomo said he would like to see a report from the council as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo said. “This is not a light switch that we can just flick on and everything goes back to normal—we have to come up with a smart, consistent strategy to restart the systems we shut down and get people back to work, and to the extent possible we want to do that through a regional approach because we are a regional economy.”</p>
<p>The governor added that the council will start discussions on Tuesday and will develop a framework based on science and data to gradually ease the stay at home restrictions and get our economy back up and running.”</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo acknowledged President Trump’s contention that the federal government has the authority to re-open, but said that he wished the President would clarify what his plan is and it could then be determined whether that plan was Constitutional.</p>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Murphy said, “The only path to a sustainable economic recovery is through a strong healthcare recovery. Then, and only then, do we position ourselves to fully ignite our economy and get the residents of our state back to work while minimizing the danger of this disease.”</p>
<p>He added, “A coordinated, regional approach, informed by a multi-state council of experts, will help us avoid a major setback with potentially disastrous consequences.”</p>
<p>A number of the Northeast governors questioned the President’s claim, since it was the respective states that ordered the shutdown of non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>Also, on Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced an agreement on a shared vision for reopening their economies and controlling COVID-19 into the future.</p>
<p>California, Oregon and Washington have agreed to work together on what they termed will be a shared approach for reopening their economies—one that identifies clear indicators for communities to restart public life and business.</p>
<p>Among the principles that each state has agreed on, include that “health outcomes and science—not politics” will guide their decisions to re-start their economies.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[As we all learn to navigate this new world of virtual meetings, house tours and social gatherings, businesses like Zoom, GoToMeeting, Face Time, Google Hang Outs, Skype, HouseParty and others are helping to make socializing a bit easier for everyone.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The COVID-19 virus has changed all of our lives. Surgical masks and gloves are now part of our daily attire and “social distancing” has become the norm. Restaurants and bars are just empty shells of their past lives, nightclub floors are devoid of bands, movie theaters are ghost towns and video chatting has replaced most personal contact.</p>
<p>As we all learn to navigate this new world of virtual meetings, house tours and social gatherings, businesses like Zoom, GoToMeeting, Face Time, Google Hang Outs, Skype, HouseParty and others are helping to make socializing a bit easier for everyone.</p>
<p>According to many published reports, Zoom has been rated as one of the 10 best companies to work for in 2019, and has experienced tremendous growth over the past year. Founded in 2011 by Eric Yuan, Zoom is headquartered in San Jose, CA and currently employs more than 2,000 people worldwide. It boasts over 700,000 business customers and has seen a 61% rise in users from last year.<br />
The publicly-traded company saw a fourth quarter total revenue of over $188 million—up 78% from last year. Total sales for the year topped $622 million, representing an 88% increase over the previous year.</p>
<div id="attachment_31949" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DOLGETTA-ONLINE-PIC.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31949" class=" wp-image-31949" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DOLGETTA-ONLINE-PIC.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="281" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-31949" class="wp-caption-text">John Dolgetta, Esq. in a recent HGAR informational Zoom meeting.</p></div>
<p>Since the Coronavirus outbreak, HGAR has relied on Zoom for everything from meetings to real estate continuing education classes. “Zoom and similar tools that are allowing HGAR to do meetings and live remote education classes have been vital to our communication and functioning as an association during this time,” said Gail Fattizzi, HGAR President. “As more of our staff and members get comfortable with the technology, it will make it easier to continue using these tools over the long-term.”</p>
<p>Zoom can accommodate up to 300 meeting participants and up to 10,000 viewers for webinars. For those working at home, the company also offers virtual backgrounds to hide messy home offices. If that’s not enough, there’s also a “Touch Up My Appearance” feature that helps to reduce dark circles or bags under the eyes, as well as mild skin blemishes. To date, it has more than 12 million users.</p>
<p>“We have been using Zoom for the last three weeks, and we actually like the concept,” said Carol Christiansen, principal broker/partner of Café Realty in Mount Kisco. “We will probably continue to use Zoom on occasion once we are all past this pandemic.”</p>
<p>Kerri Stretch, of John J. Lease Realtors in Middletown has actually been using Zoom for the past four years for her weekly sales coaching sessions that bring in Realtors from all over the nation. “In light of what’s been happening now, we’re using Zoom for office meetings and even happy hours,” she said.</p>
<p>Stretch also relies on video chatting with either FaceTime or Zoom for new client meetings. “I always do a welcome video chat with new clients,” she explained. “They’ve never met me before and it gives both of us a chance to get to know each other. It’s that personal touch.”</p>
<p>For Stretch, video chats are a ‘must” when presenting an offer to sellers. “I like to see their expressions,” she said. “Over the phone, it loses something, but when I see them, I know how to better direct things from there.”</p>
<p>Clayton Livingston of Grand Lux Realty Inc. in Armonk agrees that video chats and meetings are going to be the new way of doing business—even after the Coronavirus subsides. “Between Zoom, Skype, FaceTime, Cisco, Facebook video and audio, it seems like all of my meetings now are scheduled around my screen,” he said.</p>
<p>While he misses those in-person meetings, Livingston said today’s new video reality has saved him many hours of commuting time. “I’m able to meet with people virtually anytime anywhere, so I don’t think that this is going to change after this pandemic is over,” he added. “I’m going to continue to meet with people virtually, as it is been such a bonus for not only myself, but also the people who I meet with.”</p>
<p>A more informal way of connecting is a fairly new smart phone app called “Houseparty.” It allows users to “announce” when they enter the app and are ready to video chat by sending a notification to all their friends, eliminating the need for scheduling. Anyone who receives an “In The House” notification can hop right into a video chat with their friend who sent it, and anyone else who happens to be in the app at the time. Up to eight users at a time can be on one chat, and the average person is spending about 60 minutes a day on Houseparty.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016, Houseparty is based in San Francisco, CA and was acquired by Epic Games of North Carolina in 2019. “We have a common vision to make human interaction easier and more enjoyable, and always with respect for privacy,&#8221; said Sima Sisani, Houseparty Co-Founder and CEO.</p>
<p>To date, the app has more than 20 million users. It is the sixth most downloaded free app in the U.S. and the most downloaded in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. In the U.S., the app is most popular in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas.</p>
<p>“We have heard so many stories of users hosting play dates, cocktail parties, game nights, business calls and even job interviews,” added Kelsey Grady, a Houseparty spokesperson. “It’s also becoming a great way for real estate agents to do virtual tours.”</p>
<p>On that note, Fattizzi believes that video technology will continue to be part of the new norm of doing business for everyone, and especially for HGAR members as the association’s geographic footprint continues to expand. “It will encourage more members from all our various areas to participate in committee meetings, training, CE classes and other programs regardless of where they are physically being held,” she added. “In fact, our Young Professionals Network Steering Committee even held a virtual happy hour to stay connected.”</p>
<p>In an effort to make working at home and attending video meetings and conferences more like in-person gatherings, Zoom has developed some helpful tips:</p>
<p>• Get dressed from head to toe. Put on an outfit you’d normally wear to the office and not the ratty old shirt you’d wear to clean your garage.</p>
<p>• Take five regularly. Just like the office, proactively take breaks every hour to avoid burnout.</p>
<p>• Stretch. Stop your video and stretch yourself a little bit every hour.</p>
<p>• Communicate your availability. Publish your calendar so others can see it and quickly understand your commitment. You can block off time for work on projects, set reminders for important tasks, and even toggle your Zoom Chat status to busy.</p>
<p>• Eliminate distractions. Shut the door to give yourself some privacy and separation. You’ll also want to close tabs and pause notifications so you’re not tempted to constantly check social media.</p>
<p>• Avoid isolation and loneliness. Many people need that personal contact with their team, so it’s helpful to have daily team stand-ups and check-ins. You can even set up a “group lunch” with your colleagues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Novel Coronavirus has all but put the Hudson Valley real estate market “on pause” with Realtors forced since March 22 to navigate a myriad of regulations, including virtual showings only, to close residential transactions.</p>
<p>A recently released <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-1st-Qtr-2020-Real-Estate-Market-Report-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report by OneKey Multiple Listing Service indicated that the market area of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors</a> entered the pandemic that took hold in March on a very strong note, with mostly higher sales and higher sale prices.</p>
<p>Westchester County experienced a 7.2% increase in single-family home sales with 1,055 sales compared with 984 sales in the first quarter of 2019. Rockland County had an increase of 15% with sales of 452 units compared to 393 units in the first quarter of 2019. Putnam County sales were up 8.7% at 224, Sullivan County single-family sales rose 6.1% to 209 units and Bronx County (not officially a OneKey service area) had an increase of 6% at 123 single-family unit sales. Orange County sales dropped 3.5% to 737 sales from 764 sales in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>The first quarter median sales price for single-family homes was higher in all counties as compared to a year earlier. Orange County’s median sales price saw an 11.2% increase going from $250,00 in the first quarter of 2019 to $277,900 in the first quarter of this year. The median sales price increased by 6.7% to $640,000 in Westchester, 2.4% to $335,00 in Putnam, 3.1% to $459,00 in Rockland; 25.8% to $163,500 in Sullivan and 7.8% to $520,000 in Bronx County.</p>
<p>Condominium unit sales did not fare as well as the single-family sector with the exception of Putnam County where sales rose to 33 units from 24 in 2019 (up 37.5%) and Bronx County where sales increased to 44 units from 34 in 2019 (up 29.4%). Orange saw sales of 86 units were down from 117 a year earlier and Westchester at 233 units was down from 258 units in 2019.</p>
<p>The median price of a condominium unit in Westchester rose 8.3% in the first quarter of 2020 to $390,000. as compared to 12 months earlier. The median price for a condo in Rockland shot up 8.1% during the same period to $254,000, while Putnam’s condo median rose 15.7% in the first quarter to $251,000. The median price for a condo unit in Orange County shot up 7.1% to $182,000.</p>
<p>Westchester registered a decline in sales in its co-op market with 378 units sold compared to 448 units in the first quarter of 2019. The median price of a co-op unit in Westchester rose 3.3% to $175,500 from $169,950 in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>In recently released market reports by a number of area brokerage firms, all agreed that demand for residential housing in the region was strong throughout the market area. However, beginning on March 22 when Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Executive Order putting the state on pause went into effect, the pace of sales has slowed considerably. Most brokerage firms say the degree of economic impact the pandemic will cause will depend upon the length of time the restrictions on how real estate sales can be conducted are in place.</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope emerged on Monday, April 13 when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the governors of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Rhode Island agreed to the formation of a regional council to study how to restore the economy and get people back to work. President Donald Trump has stated that the federal government has the power to order states to reopen businesses and has been pondering whether some form of restart of the national economy could take place by May 1.</p>
<p>HGAR President Gail Fattizzi said the market was off to a “roaring start” until the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. She noted, “Without a crystal ball, and no historical perspective on a global shutdown of this magnitude, we can only base our market predictions for the rest of the year on what we saw prior to the crisis, and factors we believe will be in place.”</p>
<p>She said the impacts caused by the pandemic will likely depend on the duration of the crisis. The longer it goes on, the more impact on the overall economy, including employment, household wealth and consumer confidence, Fattizzi noted.</p>
<p>“I do believe there will be many sellers ready to sell, and healthy buyer demand for suburban and even rural properties when we emerge on the other side of this that will fuel a strong comeback of the market in the latter part of the year,” Fattizzi predicted. “Both sellers and potential buyers are sitting home right now pondering whether the property and location they&#8217;re in now is where they want to be for the long-term.”</p>
<p>In a report authored by Houlihan Lawrence Chairman Stephen Meyers and President and CEO Liz Nunan, the brokerage firm described first quarter sales as strong in most of the communities it services, but noted that closed sales are a lagging indicator and reflect market sentiment and activity during the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>Pending sales, those scheduled to close in the next 30 to 90 days, are a leading indicator and are more indicative of what can be expected in the future.</p>
<p>“Unlike service businesses that can never recoup their losses—restaurants cannot regain their losses at a later date—real estate transactions may be delayed, but pent up demand can level out much of the decline we will experience over the next three to six months,” Houlihan Lawrence stated in its first quarter report.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, managing partner of Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty, agreed that prior to the onset of the pandemic, the real estate market was thriving, overcoming the lingering suppressive effects of the SALT Cap.</p>
<p>“Sales were up. Prices were up,” he said. “And all the economic indicators were positive: rates were near historic lows, unemployment was down near a historic low, the economy was strong, and prices were still pretty attractive given that they were still near 2004 levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the pause ordered by the governor will have its impacts on the economy, Rand stressed, “We should all be clear that the Essential Services Order was a smart decision by the governor, really the only decision that the governor could have made. This is a public health emergency, and the most important consideration any of us should have is preserving the life and safety of ourselves, our families, and our fellow citizens.”</p>
<p>He noted that despite the restrictions, title companies, attorneys and others in the sale process have been creative to close deals without access to municipal files, village halls or conventional closing rooms. One example of that creativity Rand noted was one Orange County attorney who has set up a “closing tent” on his office building lawn with dividers to allow buyers and sellers to maintain distance.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the second quarter, Rand believes that the threat of the Coronavirus will keep some people home and the deterioration in the economy will reduce home buyer demand.</p>
<p>He noted that there has been a reduction in listings and closings due to the pandemic. Rand estimates that closed business in the second quarter will be down approximately 40% from the same period in 2019 assuming that title companies and attorneys can continue to close transactions that are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>“To put that in perspective the largest regional year-over-year decline in transactions on record is from the first quarter of 2008, when sales were down 30%,” Rand noted. “This will likely be worse, simply because we’re not going to be feeding the front end of the sales cycle with new listings in April and maybe through May.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—While President Donald Trump is pondering whether to restarting some segments of the economy in some areas by May 1, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced today that he will extend the state’s “On Pause” restrictions until May 15.</p>
<p>The governor said the extension of the restrictions that include the closure of non-essential businesses, schools, etc. was done in consultation with other regional states.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unpausing New York and reopening our economy is going to be an ongoing process over the coming weeks that we&#8217;re working through with other states, but we have to do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t drive up the infection rate and create a second wave of the virus,&#8221; Gov. Cuomo said. &#8220;We have shown that we can control the spread of the virus, but we can&#8217;t now undo all the progress we&#8217;ve made.”</p>
<p>Referring to the recent formation of a coalition of seven Northeastern states to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Cuomo adds, “As we continue to work on a regional plan to get people back to work and get businesses back up and running in a safe and responsible way, we are extending all New York State on Pause functions until May 15th in coordination with other states in our multi-state council because although we can control the beast, we need to get that infection rate down even more and we are not there yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo also directed all New Yorkers to wear masks or face coverings on public transportation systems and while taking private transportation or riding in for-hire vehicles. Additionally, all operators of public systems, private carriers and for-hire vehicles must wear a mask or face covering at all times while working. </p>
<p>These directives expand on the Executive Order announced by the governor on Wednesday requiring all people in New York to wear a mask or a face covering when out in public and in situations where social distancing cannot be maintained. The Executive Order will go into effect on Friday, April 17th, at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 15, there were 8,505 additional cases of Novel Coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 222,284 confirmed cases in New York State and a total of 606 COVID-19 deaths, down from 752 the day before and 758 on Monday.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Indian Point 2 reactor has been in operation for more than 45 years. Entergy reported today that the Unit 3 reactor is scheduled to be permanently shut down by April 30, 2020.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>BUCHANAN—A day that many business leaders have dreaded and environmentalists have hailed will come to pass tomorrow morning (April 30). The Indian Point Unit 2 reactor will be shut down by control room operators at the nuclear power plant complex here by Entergy Corp.</p>
<p>The Indian Point 2 reactor has been in operation for more than 45 years. Entergy reported today that the Unit 3 reactor is scheduled to be permanently shut down by April 30, 2021.</p>
<p>“Over the last 45 years, thousands of dedicated professionals have operated Unit 2 at Indian Point—safely, securely and reliably,” said Chris Bakken, Entergy’s Chief Nuclear Officer. “We owe each of them our thanks for a job well done and for their commitment to the highest standards of professionalism.”</p>
<p>Unit 2 began commercial operations on Aug. 1, 1974 and was purchased by Entergy in 2001.</p>
<p>The shutdown of both operating units at Indian Point was announced in 2017 pursuant to a settlement agreement with the State of New York and was the result of a number of factors, including sustained low current and projected wholesale energy prices that reduced revenues as well as the costs associated with relicensing of the two reactors.</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to employees at Indian Point, the company has previously announced a plan to find a position within Entergy for those qualified employees who are willing to relocate. Currently, more than 40 employees from Indian Point have accepted offers to continue with Entergy in other locations.</p>
<p>In April 2019, Entergy announced the proposed post-shutdown sale of the subsidiaries that own Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 to a Holtec International subsidiary. Holtec and its team plan to initiate decommissioning at Indian Point promptly following regulatory approvals and transaction close in 2021, and it expects to release portions of the site for re-use nearly 40 years sooner than if Entergy continued to own the facility, Entergy reported.</p>
<p>Holtec, through its affiliate Comprehensive Decommissioning International, will hire Entergy’s employees at Indian Point who have been selected for “Phase 1” of decommissioning.</p>
<p>Entergy owns and operates five nuclear power units in its regulated utility business, and is committed to the continued operation of its nuclear fleet in those locations. Its nuclear power plants in those markets are located in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, and have more than 5,000 megawatts of clean, reliable, and economic electricity generating capacity for customers in those regions.</p>
<p>Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including nearly 9,000 megawatts of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy has annual revenues of $11 billion and approximately 13,600 employees.</p>
<p>In response to tomorrow’s closure, New York State Senator Pete Harckham and Assemblywoman Sandy Galef issued a joint statement vowing to continue their strong support for workforce protections, local investments and rigorous oversight while the Indian Point Energy Center undergoes its decommissioning process.</p>
<p>“The decommissioning of a nuclear power plant is very new to the State of New York—the process is complicated, dangerous, and plays out over decades,” said Galef. “While the individual stakeholder may come and go, the state will be able to act on behalf of New Yorkers through a newly proposed oversight board comprised of New York State agency heads. The state has the authority, the resources, the expertise, and the desire to be an active participant and to ensure that the best interest of New Yorkers is always in mind. In a new industry with few rules and less oversight, New York State will lead by example and ensure accountability.”</p>
<p>Harckham added, “The closing of Indian Point will impact the region and its residents in many ways, and being prepared to mitigate the economic effects while also safeguarding our environment needs to be a priority. If we don’t put in due diligence now, there will be little to no chance to reverse or correct mistakes made and harmful situations that arise. Assemblywoman Galef and I both understand what is at stake here—and why appropriate actions are necessary now. We’ll make our legislative efforts a top priority and do everything possible to make sure they get passed in this session.”</p>
<p>Last year, Galef and Harckham both introduced legislation, which went unsigned by the governor, to minimize the negative impact to the workforce during this transition by requiring the decommissioning company to hire from the existing pool of Indian Point workers first. It also declared the energy facility to be a prevailing wage site, so employees will be paid commensurate with what they are making now. This legislation was resubmitted to both the Assembly and Senate earlier this year.</p>
<p>The financial implications to the local community from Indian Point’s closing are expected to be sizable. The municipal tax base and local school district funding have long been supported by the energy facility, and maintaining a good portion of that support is crucial, especially in light of unforeseen municipal costs incurred during the Novel Coronavirus pandemic, the two lawmakers noted,</p>
<p>To steady tax revenues for the Town of Cortlandt, Village of Buchanan and Hendrick Hudson School District during the transition, legislation has been introduced to include spent fuel and the fuel casks at the nuclear facility as part of its real property tax assessment. Otherwise, market value of the non-operating plant will adversely affect the assessment and create an unmanageable revenue gap for these tax-funded entities. Similar legislation was introduced last year but did not advance to the governor.</p>
<p>Galef and Harckham have also introduced legislation to create a statewide board to oversee the decommissioning of Indian Point. This legislation (A.10236 / S.8154) would bring New York State to the table to oversee and monitor the decommissioning of any nuclear plant in the state.</p>

As a result of the association’s recently developed Strategic Plan, the goal of this program is identifying and developing new leaders for HGAR’s future.</p>
<p>The current leadership of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors recently held a virtual information session on its new initiative for 2020—the <a href="https://www.hgar.com/resources/hgar-leadership-accelerator-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership Accelerator Program</a>. As a result of the association’s recently developed Strategic Plan, the goal of this program is identifying and developing new leaders for HGAR’s future.</p>
<p>HGAR President Gail Fattizzi has personally risen through the ranks over the past 20 years, volunteering in many roles including Education Council Chair, Communications Council Chair, Association Secretary/Treasurer, as well as a NAR and NYSAR Director and many other positions.</p>
<p>“I’d estimate that it took me the better part of 10 years of involvement to fully understand all of the opportunities and how everyone works together,” she said. “But, 10 years is too long to wait for new leadership to get up to speed and move our organization forward. We need to find and develop those leaders now.”</p>
<p>The recent videoconference information session was hosted by Fattizzi and Katheryn DeClerck, the Leadership Accelerator Facilitator. There will be 10 sessions involving various topics, beginning September 2020 and concluding in June 2021.</p>
<p>“My personal belief is that leadership qualities are innate,” added Fattizzi. “I don’t think leaders can be created, and not everyone is meant to or wants to lead. But I do think that leadership skills can be identified, cultivated, channeled and given the right platform to shine.”</p>
<p>There’s still time to apply for the program, which will be held at HGAR’s various locations. For more information, please contact Jana Currier, Director of Member Engagement, at: <a href="mailto:jana.currier@hgar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jana.currier@hgar.com</a>.</p>

<p>WHITE PLAINS—U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY-18) in a more than 50-minute online session hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors recently offered his views on the COVID-19 crisis’ impacts on the real estate industry and how the federal government going forward will be assisting businesses in New York State affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The HGAR webinar was held on Friday, May 1 and was hosted by HGAR President Gail Fattizzi; HGAR Legislative Committee Chair Leah Caro; Katheryn DeClerck, Congressman Maloney’s Federal Political Coordinator; and HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty.</p>
<p>Congressman Maloney noted that thus far there has been approximately $3 trillion in COVID-19 funding assistance that has been approved by Congress that has been geared to helping business and those unemployed during the ongoing health care crisis.</p>
<p>“I think for the most part we’ve got the right strategy, at least on the economic crisis, it was bipartisan, which is good. I think we’ve got a big fight coming on state and local aid and everybody from our part of the world should care about that a lot,” Rep. Maloney said.</p>
<p>The Congressman said he is hopeful that sometime in the future Congress will re-establish the state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which he noted would help the real estate industry in the Hudson Valley and also serve a means to reinvigorate the economy.</p>
<p>In terms of the SALT deductions, the Congressman said, “I think we are going to win that fight by the way. Sooner or later we are going to win that fight and we deserve to.” He said the victory could come as part of another COVID-related aid package later this year or perhaps after the Presidential election in November.</p>
<p>Rep. Maloney believes the real estate industry will weather the COVID-19 crisis pretty well and noted that the Hudson Valley will likely benefit from those living and working in urban areas seeking to relocate to a more suburban environment.</p>
<p>“I do believe you will see a lot of people appreciate the value of having a property outside of the city and maybe commuting instead of living down there,” he said. “And so, for the Hudson Valley, folks there is every reason to believe that your industry can be strong and recover quickly.”</p>
<p>In terms of the current state of the nation’s response to COVID-19 pandemic and his view on the months ahead, he noted, “I think we have a lot of serious work to do to fully win the fight against this virus,” Congressman Maloney said. “But, I do think that we will never be in the position we were in over the last six weeks where the country found itself on its back foot, overwhelmed by this crisis…”</p>
<p>He noted that the nation and New York State particularly, have made great strides and are now poised to implement mitigation measures on testing, contract tracing and therapies and is now on a path to an expedited path to the development of a vaccine.</p>
<p>The Congressman later said that with those mitigation measures now in the works, along with safe social distancing and PPEs, such as masks likely still being required this fall, the nation should be prepared for a possible second wave of the virus in the fall.</p>
<p>“I think the worst is actually behind us,” Rep. Maloney said. He noted that while the nation will have paid a terrible price, the enormous amount of stimulus funding could lead to a much stronger economy by this time next year.</p>
<p>Congressman Maloney, who is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, predicted that the House will move a major $1-trillion infrastructure bill in the next six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>The key will be if the proposal can be agreed upon by the House and Senate and later signed into law by President Trump. The bill will be far-reaching and will include investment in ports, mass transit, roads and bridges, he said.</p>
<p>The House T&amp;I Committee will likely mark up the $1-trillion infrastructure bill in the next several months, but he noted that he does not expect it to be included in the next federal COVID-19 stimulus package.</p>
<p>“Infrastructure is coming and it should come as the next major bipartisan step once we get through this short-term fight on state and local (assistance),” Rep. Maloney predicted.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3>Kicking COVID to the Curb</h3>
<p>While the Coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on people’s lives and careers, one New City agent not only managed to overcome the virus herself, but actually received offers on two homes, sight unseen, during these incredibly challenging times!</p>
<p>Some may consider Betsy Estrella-Mejia a real estate “newbie,” earning her license just three years ago, but the Christie’s International Realty agent credits her ultra-positive attitude with helping her to get well and make sales in a climate that has most Realtors playing the “waiting game.”</p>
<p>“My husband always tells me I’m overly positive,” she admitted. “I guess I’m one of those people who just keep going. Of course, we all have those days that seem like a breakdown, but I believe we need the breakdown to have a breakthrough.”</p>
<p>The Stony Point mother of two didn’t worry when her husband, a lab technician, came home one day complaining of a headache. He had no fever or sinus infection, and just one day of chills. By the third day he was fine. A few days later, Estrella-Mejia developed a fever that quickly shot up to 104. “Then came the aches and pains, so I locked myself up in a room and called a neighbor to drop off some food for my kids,” she said.</p>
<p>After testing positive for COVID-19, she continued to self-quarantine, while still spending a few minutes a day to stay in touch with clients via e-mail and texts. Her husband was also later instructed to stay home, as someone with whom he worked tested positive for the virus. “The biggest thing was the fever and the fatigue” she recalled. “It also came to a point where it was hard to speak because breathing was so difficult.”</p>
<p>Estrella-Mejia survived on tea and soup, while taking 1,000 MG of Tylenol every four hours for five days in a row. At one point, her husband called 911 when her oxygen levels dipped too low. “Rather than take me to the hospital, they just gave me oxygen at home,” she explained. She also added warm baths with peppermint oil, which helped with her breathing.</p>
<p>After two weeks, she started to feel better and was able to start breathing exercises. She also picked up contact with her clients. Following almost four weeks, she was fully recovered and managed to secure six buyer contracts during the month of March. Two of her buyers made offers on homes without even physically seeing them!</p>
<p>“First, they drove by to take a look at the outside,” she explained. “Then we asked the sellers to conduct the virtual tours themselves, showing every detail inside the homes.” Home inspections were also completed virtually using the phone app “What’s App,” which allowed her and the buyers to view the inspection live in real time.</p>
<p>When both buyers made offers, Estrella-Mejia was surprised, but not shocked. “It all depends on their motivation and expectations,” she said. One buyer is a contractor purchasing a home needing some TLC, and the other is someone who is simply ready to purchase now. Both homes are currently under contract and should be closing in the near future. “If you have the right team to work with, you can still get things closed,” she added.</p>
<p>These days Estrella-Mejia continues to work with other potential buyers, relying on virtual tours and inspections. Having corresponded with many relocation clients, she is no stranger to buyers who don’t actually see the home until the closing date. Even prior to the pandemic, she always made it a point to meet new clients virtually via teleconference to get to know them.</p>
<p>Looking back to 2017, it was a local Realtor who convinced her to get into real estate. “I was a happy client of a Realtor and just decided that this was something I wanted to do,” she recalled. “On my very first day, I made two appointments!” Starting part-time in the industry, Estrella-Mejia switched to full time in just three months. In her first six months, she sold 10 properties, followed by 24 the next year, and 21 in 2019. Estrella-Mejia spent almost her entire time with Keller Williams before joining Christie’s in December.</p>
<p>Prior to real estate, she worked with several financial institutions in Manhattan. “This was really helpful to me because now I know the ins and outs of the loan process, so I can educate my clients and find the best approach for them,” she said. Estrella-Mejia holds a Business Management degree from Herbert Lehman College in the Bronx, including a double major in Finance and Human Resources and a minor in Computer Applications.</p>
<p>Last year, she also got involved with HGAR’s newly revamped Young Professionals Network (YPN) and has attended both live and virtual happy hours. “I find it very helpful for people who are new to the business,” she said. “It can provide a lot of guidance.” She also volunteers with the Falling Angels Sickle Cell Foundation in Garnerville.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping on top of the real estate market, Estrella-Mejia is home-schooling her young children, aged four and six. She’s also back to her morning routine of jogging, shortly after rising at 5:00 a.m. “My favorite pastime, of course, is spending time with my family. We love to walk and hike,” she said.</p>
<p>Having survived one of the worst pandemics in our history, Estrella-Mejia refuses to consider herself as a victim. “You can’t focus on everything that’s difficult because if you do, that’s what you’ll attract. You have to focus on the good things,” she said. “My philosophy is that I kicked COVID out and I can sell anything now!”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>While most Realtors are still dealing with the frustration that the COVID-19 has placed on their industry, some are starting to discover different ways to conduct business and deal with their daily stress.</p>
<p>Virtual cocktail parties and drive-by visits to relatives are now part of the new norm, but Irene Guanill has taken that to a new level. The Broker-Owner of Meet the Sellers in the Bronx recently donned an Easter Bunny costume to pay “socially distanced” visits to families in Pelham Bay, Throggs Neck, City Island and Morris Park. “It actually took me two days, but I visited a lot of neighborhoods, waved to kids and did a little dance in the streets,” she said. “The feedback was amazing and I was so glad to be able to do something to bring smiles to other people and to myself.”</p>
<p>As president of the Pelham Bay Merchants Association, Guanill offered her “Easter Bunny” visits to anyone who was interested. For Guanill, the biggest frustration now is trying to keep busy, as live listings and showings are still prohibited. “I do a lot of volunteering,” she added, describing her work with New York Cares, delivering food to those who are homebound.</p>
<p>Guanill admits she is fortunate in that she also operates a property management business, which is bringing in income. “I haven’t filed for unemployment yet, but I do plan on applying for a small business loan,” she said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, people are still looking for homes. “I get calls every day from people who want to see virtual tours, but they’re not going to take any action until they can actually see the property,” she said. “Videos just don’t do the property justice—people not only need to see the home, but they also need to have a feeling for it. Most people buy a house because they fall in love with it or have some type of emotional connection to it.”</p>
<div id="attachment_32161" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lata-and-alec.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32161" class=" wp-image-32161" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lata-and-alec.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="313" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32161" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Alec Miller and Dr. Lata McGinn of Cognitive Behavioral Consultants in White Plains.</p></div>
<p>Ron Garfalo, sales manager for John J. Lease Realtors in Middletown, finds himself on the other side, trying to keep more than 50 agents motivated during the pandemic. “All we can do right now is offer virtual tours and keep in contact with clients and potential clients,” he said. “It’s definitely frustrating because no one’s making any money, and for those who are the sole household provider, it’s very difficult.”</p>
<p>Garafalo continues to hold weekly sales meetings via Zoom teleconference, in addition to scheduling one-on-one phone calls with agents. “The good thing is that when things change and live showings are permitted again, potential buyers will already have their list of homes ready, and sellers will be able to once again open their doors.”</p>
<p>His main concern now is making sure all of the agents are healthy and doing the right thing to stay healthy. “I think we all have to stay positive and hope that when this is finally over, there’s going to be a demand for both buying and selling,” he added. “Overall, communication is crucial. People want to know that other people are here for them.”</p>
<p>In light of the pandemic, he has had to cancel all of the planned live fundraising events for the Realtors Political Action Committee (RPAC). Garafalo, along with Carol Christiansen, broker-owner of Café Realty in Mount Kisco, are co-chairing HGAR’s RPAC Committee this year. “It’s very disappointing, but what choice do we have,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Lata McGinn and Dr. Alec Miller of Cognitive Behavioral Consultants in White Plains explain that it’s normal for people to be upset and uneasy during a stressful time like this. “It does feel unpleasant but that can actually be like an alarm to help us move toward helpful action,” said Dr. Mc Ginn. “We can call a friend, set up a video conference chat, watch a comedy or even clean out a closet to help distract us and experience some pleasure. Problems occur when we sit in a pool of emotions and don’t take any action.”</p>
<p>Dr. Miller added that continued sadness can eventually lead to depression. “There is a lot of grief out there—so many people are dying, others are getting sick, businesses are shut down and in many cases there’s a significant loss of income,” he said. “People can feel like there’s nothing they can do, but the fact of the matter is that there are still things you can do to feel empowered—even if it’s something simple like helping friends and family, donating food, or planning your next trip to the grocery store.”</p>
<p>Helping others, they both agreed, is a very powerful anti-depressant. The doctors also suggested balancing your life with healthy eating, exercise and limiting the 24/7 drumbeat of negative stories on television and social media.</p>
<p>Practicing mindfulness for just a few minutes a day is another important step in helping to improve your mood. “Just sit quietly and when your mind starts to wander, bring it back gently,” said Dr. Miller. “We also recommend a ‘gratitude check’—being mindful about things you are grateful for, even in the face of this pandemic.”</p>
<p>For Bonnie Koff, the “New York on Pause” situation has hit home very hard—not just for her business, but for the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation Fundraising Committee, which she chairs. An agent with William Raveis Legends Realty Group in Tarrytown, Koff worries that the cancellation of Foundation “Pub Nights” will mean significant financial losses for the charities that it supports. “I’m an optimist though, and I’m just praying that we can bring back our ‘Pub Nights’ in the near future,” she said.</p>
<p>Referring to herself as a “completely social animal,” Koff struggles with being homebound. “I do a lot of e-mail campaigns with clients and potential clients and I’m always on the phone, video chats and social media,” she explained.</p>
<div id="attachment_32163" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bonnie-koff.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32163" class=" wp-image-32163" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bonnie-koff.jpeg" alt="" width="281" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32163" class="wp-caption-text">Bonnie Koff of William Raveis Legends Realty Group works on creative fundraising plans for the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation.</p></div>
<p>Koff has already filed for unemployment, and these days she’s getting more calls from would-be sellers than buyers. “I’m advising people who want to sell their homes to wait until the ‘stay at home’ order is lifted,” she said. “However, I do give them the option of listing it virtually, using their own photos or having me offer a virtual open house. The bottom line is that buyers will still want to see the home in person.” She also had two clients step back from purchasing homes after spouses were furloughed from their jobs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she has been busy helping to set up a “Meal Train” of food donations to White Plains Hospital, where her granddaughter works as an Emergency Room nurse. “Rachael calls me every morning after her shift, just to let me know she’s OK,” said Koff, who always worries about her.</p>
<p>Cognitive Behavioral Consultants offers a quick checklist that people can use to avoid negative thoughts during this pandemic. “First recognize how you feel in a given moment when your emotion is high and then recognize that what you say is having a powerful impact on how you feel, “said Dr. McGinn. “Your mind is believing everything you are saying to yourself and triggering powerful emotions. Then come up with helpful thoughts and do the mental exercise of saying them to yourself even if you don’t believe it.”</p>
<p>Remaining positive that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel, Koff admits she does feel good about the future of her real estate business and the Realtor Foundation. “I’m confident we will get back to normal,” she said. “You know, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger always says, ‘I’ll be back!’”</p>

So first, we need to know who is a Facilitator? A Facilitator is a OneKey MLS Participant who is appointed by the MLS Board]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As we all know, the new OneKey MLS roll out is taking place. Clear Cooperation is now a requirement and you can no longer market a property to the public without putting it on the MLS. The “Coming Soon” status will soon roll out as well. So, while you’re conducting business from home, it’s important to familiarize yourself with these new provisions of our MLS. That’s why in this month’s column, I’m going to focus on the use of a Rules Enforcement Facilitator.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a Rules Enforcement Facilitator?</strong></p>
<p>Rules Enforcement Facilitators (Facilitators) have been commonly used by Long Island Realtors for quite some time; however, for us, the use of these intermediaries will be new. So first, we need to know who is a Facilitator? A Facilitator is a OneKey MLS Participant who is appointed by the MLS Board of Managers to assist our members in certain situations. A list of these Facilitators, approximately 30 of them in total, is posted on the HGAR website in the Document Library. You can find this list under the tab “OneKey MLS Reference,” under the title “<a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2020/04/Rules-Enforcemant-Facilitators.pdf">Rules Enforcement Facilitators</a>.” It can also be found in Matrix under “External Links.” If a particular issue arises where the use of a Facilitator is permitted, any one of these Facilitators can be selected to assist. There are Facilitators from various brokerages and regions and a Participant is free to choose a Facilitator that suits them best or with whom they are most familiar.</p>
<p><strong>What Do Facilitators Do?</strong></p>
<p>If you, as a member, have an issue that falls under the purview and authority of a Facilitator, you can use their assistance in obtaining results, However, there are a few steps that you must take before you contact them. (1) First, as an agent, you must attempt to resolve the issue with the other agent and/or the other agent’s broker of record/owner/manager. (2) If these efforts are ineffective, you must involve your broker of record/owner/manager to assist in obtaining a response from the agent; and if not the agent, the agent’s broker of record/owner/manager. (3) Finally, if a response is not forthcoming after all these efforts, then and only then, can a Facilitator be contacted. But, what is most important is that ONLY A PARTICIPANT (i.e. broker of record/owner/manager) can contact a Facilitator. The Participant can act on behalf of the broker’s agents.</p>
<p><strong>What Acts Involve a Facilitator?</strong></p>
<p>Facilitators can be engaged for only a few specific issues; however, these issues are some of the most common problems that face agents. They are:</p>
<p><strong>Showing Requests</strong></p>
<p>• A Cooperating Broker cannot contact the Listing Broker to make an appointment to show the property or;</p>
<p>• The Listing Broker is responding in an unreasonably slow matter regarding showing requests.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation of Offers</strong></p>
<p>• A Cooperating Broker cannot contact the Listing Broker to make an offer or;</p>
<p>• The Listing Broker is responding in an unreasonably slow matter regarding an offer made.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation of Presentation of Offers/Offer Acknowledgment Form</strong></p>
<p>• A signed Offer Acknowledgment Form or a signed Sworn Declaration Statement is not returned to the Cooperating Broker within the specified period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Listing Broker Fails to Provide Written Instructions/Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>• After request from a Cooperating Broker, a Listing Broker fails to timely provide written instructions or information relating to showings or access restrictions on a listed property.</p>
<p><strong>Powers of the Facilitator</strong></p>
<p>In addition to being able to intervene on behalf of an aggrieved Participant to assist in resolving an issue, a Facilitator has the power to impose automatic fines on those that the Facilitator deems to have violated the MLS Rules. The fines are as follows:</p>
<p>• $500 fine for a first violation of this type by that Participant’s office;</p>
<p>• $750 fine for a second violation of this type by the Participant’s office;</p>
<p>• $1,000 fine for the third and any further violations of this type by that Participant’s office.</p>
<p>It is important to note that violations are recorded against a Participant’s office, not the individual agents, and this escalating violation count against a Participant’s office continues for as long as a Participant remains with the MLS. Additionally, the accrual of multiple violations by a Participant’s office could also expose the Participant to additional discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The use of Rules Enforcement Facilitators is a great benefit to our members. It works to assist members in trying to move all transactions forward in a professional manner. It levels the playing field to benefit all Realtors. At its core, it addresses one of the most common problems that agents face: trying to show a property or trying to make an offer (and proof of same). These issues have always plagued our industry.</p>
<p>With the advent of the neutral Facilitator, these problems will demand immediate redress and the pressure to comply is persuasive, as serious fines could accrue. As a result, I feel that all members will communicate more quickly and professionally. This, in turn, will make our industry more transparent and efficient and this will confer an enormous benefit on the clients we serve.</p>
<p>Stay Safe.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>During this difficult period, when individuals and businesses are concerned primarily with the personal and economic impact being caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, it is important that real estate brokers and agents continue to keep up with the new legal developments. On Dec. 16, 2019, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced new regulations (“New Fair Housing Regulations”), approved by the New York State Real Estate Board, to assist with combating housing discrimination [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2Wv44g5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2Wv44g5</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3bq639H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3bq639H</a>]. These regulations were a direct result of the <em>Newsday</em> investigation which rocked the real estate industry in Long Island as well as the rest of New York. These new regulations are set to go into effect on June 20, 2020 and all licensees need to be aware of these new requirements.</p>
<p><strong>The New Fair Housing Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Under subsection (a) of Section 175.28, “[a] real estate broker shall be responsible to ensure that each individual licensed pursuant to Article 12-A of the New York Real Property Law and associated with such broker provides to a prospective purchaser, tenant, seller, or landlord upon first substantive contact a disclosure notice furnished by the Department….” This new disclosure (the “Disclosure”) which sets forth references to relevant provisions of the New York State Human Rights Law, also provides the consumer with the necessary information as to how to file a complaint for housing discrimination. A copy of the new disclosure is located on the New York State Department of State website [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2Wu05Ar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2Wu05Ar</a>]. It is incumbent on the broker to ensure that their agents are provided with this new disclosure and that they provide this to all clients upon “first substantive contact.”</p>
<p><strong>The Fair Housing Disclosure May Be Provided Electronically</strong></p>
<p>Section 175.28(b) provides that the Disclosure “…may be provided to a prospective purchaser, tenant, seller, or landlord by any of the following means: e-mail, text, electronic messaging system, facsimile, or hardcopy.” If an agent elects to provide a prospective purchaser, tenant, seller, or landlord with the Disclosure by e-mail or other “electronic communication” which contains a link that directs any such person to the Disclosure, the e-mail or other communication must include text that clearly states the link contains information regarding the New York State Human Rights Law. A licensee cannot relay this information verbally.</p>
<p><strong>The New Disclosure Requirement Applies to All Properties</strong></p>
<p>Section 175.28(c) requires that the Disclosure must be provided to all prospective clients in connection with “…all real property whether or not it is used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, wholly or partly, as a home or residence of one or more persons regardless of the number of units, and shall include: condominiums; cooperative apartments; vacant lands, including unimproved real property upon which such dwellings are to be constructed; or commercial properties.” Therefore, all real estate licensees, not only those who deal with residential real property, must be sure to provide the Disclosure and must be aware of the New Fair Housing Regulations. Brokers must be sure to have these forms ready to be disseminated to prospective clients and consumers starting on June 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Record-Keeping Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Section 175.8(d) further requires that any real estate broker, licensed real estate salesperson, or licensed associate broker who provides the Disclosure must obtain and maintain a signed acknowledgment for no less than three (3) years. If the Disclosure is obtained electronically (i.e., by e-mail, text, electronic messaging system, or facsimile), then a copy of it must be maintained for no less than three (3) years as well. If a prospective client declines to sign the disclosure notice, a licensee must “…set forth under oath or affirmation a written declaration of the facts regarding when such notice was provided and shall maintain a copy of the declaration for not less than three years.” This is the same type of oath or affirmation that a real estate licensee is required to obtain when a prospective client refuses to deliver a New York State Disclosure under Section 443 of Article 12-A of the New York Real Property Law [see Section 443(3)(e) at <a href="https://bit.ly/2Asdlx5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2Asdlx5</a>].<br />
New Section 175.29: Posting of Fair Housing Laws in Every Office</p>
<p>Under Section175.29(a), a real estate broker must display a required notice (the “Fair Housing Notice”) at each office and branch office operated by the broker. A copy of the notice can be found on the Department of State website [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/2xYZYDx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/2xYZYDx</a>]. The Fair Housing Notice contains the substantive provisions of the New York State Human Rights Law relative to housing accommodations. The Fair Housing Notice provides consumers with the information as to how to file a Human Rights complaint.</p>
<p>Subsection (b) requires that the Fair Housing Notice is “…prominently [emphasis added] displayed in the window of such office and any branch office maintained by such broker if [emphasis added] such broker also provides listings or other postings in the window of such location and must be visible to persons on that portion of the sidewalk adjacent to such office or branch office.” However, Subsection (b) goes on to state that “…[I]f any office or branch office is not accessible from the sidewalk or if postings are otherwise prohibited by any other applicable law…,” then the Fair Housing Notice must be posted in the same location where the business license is posted under Section 441-a of Article 12 of the Real Property Law [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3dJGdiF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3dJGdiF</a>].</p>
<p><strong>The Fair Housing Notice is Required to Be Posted on Websites</strong></p>
<p>Section 175.29(c) requires the Fair Housing Notice is posted on “[a]ll websites created and maintained by real estate brokers, associate real estate brokers, real estate salespersons and any real estate team, as such term is defined by Section 175.25 of this title….” The Fair Housing Notice must be “prominently and conspicuously” displayed on the homepage of any website maintained by all licensees, including teams. A link to the Department of State’s Fair Housing Notice must be installed on the homepage and the link should be displayed “prominently,” not hidden or buried on the homepage.</p>
<p><strong>The Fair Housing Notice Must be Displayed at All Open Houses</strong></p>
<p>Section 175.29(d) further requires that all real estate licensees must display the Fair Housing Notice at all open houses. In addition, all licensees conducting an open house must ensure that the Disclosure required under Section 175.28 is made available for all attendees. Again, it is important to note that unless “first substantive contact” occurs, the Disclosure is not required to be given to all attendees, it just needs to be available for distribution.</p>
<p><strong>New Section 177.9: Video Recording and Record Preservation</strong><br />
<strong> Required for Entities that Conduct Real Estate Instruction</strong></p>
<p>A controversial part of the new regulations includes a requirement that all courses provided by entities approved by the Department of State must record all courses “…pertaining to fair housing and/or discrimination in the sale or rental of real property or an interest in real property…in its entirety.” Section 177.9(a) requires that both the video and audio be recorded. Subsection (b) requires that the recording be maintained for at least one (1) year after the course was provided to a student. However, “[I]f the entity knows or suspects that the recording is or will be the subject of litigation, then the approved entity shall maintain such recording as required by law.” The recording is subject to any audit of the Department of State.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing Regulations Provide Additional Protections and Requirements</strong></p>
<p>It is important for brokers, associate-brokers and licensed salespersons to focus on the requirements of the new Fair Housing Regulations. While it may be difficult to focus on these requirements with everything else that is occurring right now, June 20th will be upon us quickly. All licensees must begin implementing the changes required to be made to their websites and office procedures, so that the Disclosure and Fair Housing Notice are posted and ready to be delivered to their prospective clients as required under the new regulations. While many view the new regulations as burdensome, these regulations are issued with the primary objective of protecting the consumer from discrimination. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of real estate agents to promote fair housing and protect the consumer.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The two build-to-suit developments in Montgomery for Amazon and Medline, involve nearly 2.3 million square feet of new construction totaling nearly $200 million in investment.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Site work has commenced on two of the largest warehouse-distribution facilities ever to be built in Orange County.</p>
<p>The two build-to-suit developments in Montgomery for Amazon and Medline, involve nearly 2.3 million square feet of new construction totaling nearly $200 million in investment.</p>
<p>Developer Bluewater Partners has commenced construction on the 1,015,740-square-foot distribution center for Amazon. The project secured final approvals from the Town of Montgomery and trees have been cleared and site work has been underway at the development that will involve the creation of approximately 1,000 jobs. The project is being built on a site that totals approximately 187 acres of land at 635 International Drive, at the intersection of Route 17K and Route 747.</p>
<p>The Montgomery Industrial Development Agency granted a 15-year PILOT agreement valued at $20.5 million. The warehouse is expected to create 300 construction jobs and more than 800 jobs within two years of completion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Medline Industries Inc. of Northfield, IL, has received its Final Environmental Impact Statement approval, and has secured water and sewer permits and is only awaiting site plan approval from the Town of Montgomery. Site work has commenced on the $120-million, 1.2-million-square-foot facility being developed on 118 acres on the Aden Brook Farm site.</p>
<p>The firm will be relocating from its current facility in Wawaynada to the larger complex. Medline will relocate its current workforce of 340 and plans to add 150 to 200 new positions in coming years. Medline has sold its Wawayanda property to Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>While the two projects met some local opposition, the tremendous financial benefits both ventures will provide the Town of Montgomery, its school district and Orange County, won the day.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president and CEO of the Orange County Partnership, said, “The fact that we have two of the largest buildings ever constructed in the history of Orange County underway during the worst economic crisis since the Great Recession gives a monumental infusion into our economy and the promise of good jobs moving forward.”</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus said that despite COVID restrictions, the two projects can begin construction. “I am in favor of construction starting at these two sites and many others in Orange County. I believe that construction workers can socially distance while doing their jobs.</p>
<p>He added, “Every day that goes by that people are not working is another day that is damaging our economic development and our communities,” he noted. “Tens of thousands of people in my community and throughout the state are unemployed and their families are suffering and if there is a way for us to bring them back to work in a safe manner and get them back on the payroll that should be our ultimate goal.”</p>
<p>Most of the construction work to be performed at the two projects will be performed by local labor. L. Todd Diorio, president of the Hudson Valley Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, says that a host of union trades are working on the approximately $40 million worth of site work being performed at the Amazon distribution center site. He estimated that approximately 90% of the overall project work will be performed by union labor.</p>
<p>In terms of the Medline project, Diorio noted that site work is expected to commence at the property shortly. The contractor for the site work at both the Amazon and Medline projects is Petillo Inc., which has offices in New Jersey and Middletown, NY.</p>
<p>The site work and concrete work have been bid and will be performed by union tradesmen, Diorio added. He said he is hopeful that the majority of the remainder of the project will also go union.</p>
<p>Diorio said that each project will employ several hundred union workers.</p>
<p>Jesse Greenberg, public affairs director for Medline, said, “After a lot of hard work and collaboration with the town, we received our (Final) Environmental Impact Statement approval on March 30, which was a major milestone that we needed to clear and we were very happy that we did.”</p>
<p>He said that while the firm is currently awaiting site plan approval from the town, the firm has commenced pre-construction activities at the property, including site preparation. Allston Construction has been retained as the general contractor for the project. The project is expected to take 12 months to complete.</p>
<p>During the approval process, Medline pulled an application for incentives with the Montgomery Industrial Development Agency. The firm does plan to utilize the 485B program with the State of New York. The value of those incentives has been estimated at approximately $15 million over a 10 year-term.</p>
<p>The two projects are a sign that the industrial market in Orange County and the New York metro region will continue to be strong after the COVID-19 pandemic finally dissipates.</p>
<p>Bluewater Parners, which had no comment on its Amazon project, is moving forward on a number of speculative projects in the region, including a 470,000-square-foot venture in Hazelton, NJ and another 500,000-square-foot project in Central New Jersey. The firm is also building a large development for Amazon in Johnston, RI and is also developing a site in Fishkill in Dutchess County for a grocer that will involve approximately 1 million square feet of warehouse space.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The online event on Thursday featured in addition to the Democratic Congressman who represents the 18th District, Republican Orange County Executive Steven Neuhaus, Democratic Westchester County Executive George Latimer and Republican Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—During a virtual press conference focused on the merits of the Heroes Act passed by Congress recently, U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney and the county executives of Westchester, Orange and Dutchess counties agreed that the Mid-Hudson region’s economy should be re-opened by New York State soon.</p>
<p>The online event on Thursday featured in addition to the Democratic Congressman who represents the 18th District, Republican Orange County Executive Steven Neuhaus, Democratic Westchester County Executive George Latimer and Republican Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro.</p>
<p>“I personally think that phase one should have started already in Orange County. I have a lot of double standards here that I have been very frustrated with in the county. You have for instance, Target being able to open in my county—some Targets that don’t even have food. But Main Street curbside pickup is closed,” Neuhaus said. “That’s a double standard and that is not fair.”</p>
<p>He added, “I have massive construction work—housing construction—in some areas of my county dubbed ‘affordable housing,’ but regular ‘Mom and Pop’ contractors can’t work.”</p>
<p>Neuhaus said that all the Mid-Hudson’s numbers (in connection with hospitalizations, intubations and COVID-related deaths) are all going down and that Orange County and the Mid-Hudson should qualify for reopening very soon.</p>
<p>The first phase of the reopening loosens restrictions imposed back in March on the construction and manufacturing industries, as well as the wholesale supply chain. In addition, certain retail operations can be expanded for curbside pickup and drop-off or in-store pickup. The phase one designation also affects the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries.</p>
<p>County Executive Molinaro stressed that while there was initial frustration over the state measuring compliance as a region rather than individual counties, he said, “That conversation is over.” The counties are lumped together as a region and the region is now being measured based on the seven benchmarks. At press time, the Mid-Hudson currently qualifies for five out of the seven benchmarks.</p>
<p>“All seven (county executives) in the Mid-Hudson feel we have achieved the mission of flattening the hospital curve and that at least attaining that next step toward the very small incremental (reopening) of phase one small businesses is achievable now,” Molinaro added.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive Latimer said that he understands the frustration of some more rural Mid-Hudson counties like Ulster, Orange and Dutchess seeing other similar areas in the state be allowed to re-open, but because of metrics in more populous Mid-Hudson counties, still have most businesses shuttered under the “New York at Pause” regulations imposed on March 22.</p>
<p>Latimer said he is concerned with the impact the reopening of adjacent Fairfield County, CT might have on Westchester County in coming days and weeks as some Westchester residents travel over the Connecticut border to dine in Greenwich and Stamford.</p>
<p>“As far as I am concerned I think as a region we are there (qualifying for phase one of the reopening). We have all contributed to an element of this and I want to see Steve (Neuhaus); Marcus (Molinaro); MaryEllen (Odell, Putnam County Executive); Pat (Ryan-Ulster County Executive); and everyone else have that opportunity and we want it for Westchester as well.</p>
<p>Rep. Maloney then added his view that the Mid-Hudson Region is ready to have the phase one threshold of reopening begin.</p>
<p>“I think we are unanimous in believing that the region is ready to enter phase one,” Rep. Maloney said. “We can do that in a responsible way. That means all of us as citizens need to do our part to make sure that is successful. But, I want the region open and the sooner the better.”</p>
<p>He added, “I understand and appreciate the importance of the metrics being used on the state level, but we are ready to go.”</p>
<p>The main purpose of the virtual press conference was to tout the merits of the Heroes Act, which would provide an estimated $34 billion in new funds for New York State, and an estimated $32 billion in new funds for New York’s counties and municipalities. The measure has not received much support from the GOP-controlled Senate, however.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York’s counties could see a decline in revenue of $1.5 billion to more than $3 billion for the next few years, according to a recent report from the New York State Association of Counties.</p>
<p>Under the House passed bill, Westchester County would receive $544 million in federal aid; Orange County would receive $216 million Dutchess County would receive $165 million and Putnam County would garner $55 million.</p>
<p>The funding would be distributed over two years and would bolster state and municipal budgets, and ensure New York’s health care workers, police, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers, and other vital workers can continue to be paid, the Congressman noted.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced today that pending the required training of contact tracers over the Memorial Day weekend, the Mid-Hudson regional economy will begin phase one of its economy’s reopening on Tuesday, May 26.</p>
<p>The governor in his daily COVID-19 briefing on Saturday said the Mid-Hudson region had met the metric in terms of COVID deaths and only required providing training to the several thousand contract tracers in order to meet all seven required metrics for reopening. The Mid-Hudson regional economy has been all but shut down, with the exception of essential businesses, since the governor put &#8220;New York on Pause&#8221; on March 22.</p>

<p>The governor said that in anticipation of the reopening, he would allow construction staging to commence in both regions.</p>
<p>The governor’s announcement of the reopening on Tuesday for the Mid-Hudson is welcome news to business leaders, government officials and unemployed workers in the Mid-Hudson that have been anxiously awaiting the beginning of the phased reopening of the region.</p>
<p>In recent days, county executives and other politicos, including U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney have said the Mid-Hudson region was poised and ready to begin the first phase of the reopening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the governor announced  the launch of the $100 million New York Forward Loan Fund to provide flexible and affordable loans to help small businesses, focusing on minority and women owned small businesses, that did not receive federal COVID-19 assistance. Officials noted that the state will take a smart, targeted approach for distributing these loans, focusing on businesses with 20 or fewer employees and less than $3 million in gross revenues.

    <description><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic had forced the Realtor Foundation to halt all of its volunteering efforts over the past few months. However, taking the proper safety precautions, volunteers ventured out again for the first time since early March.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CORNWALL ON HUDSON—Decked out in masks and gloves, a group of Realtors from the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation (HGRF) recently volunteered their time to help pack groceries at the Food Bank of the Hudson Valley in Cornwall-on-Hudson.</p>
<p>The Food Bank of the Hudson Valley is a branch of the Regional Food Bank of Northeastern New York and a member of Feeding America, the national food bank network. Last year, the Hudson Valley branch provided more than 15 million pounds of food to 400-member agencies in Orange, Ulster, Dutchess, Rockland, Sullivan, and Putnam counties.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had forced the Realtor Foundation to halt all of its volunteering efforts over the past few months. However, taking the proper safety precautions, volunteers ventured out again for the first time since early March.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were disappointed to have to cancel or postpone some of our planned volunteer events over the last couple of months. Especially in this time of great need, we want to help wherever we can,” said Gail Fattizzi, HGAR President and chair of the HGRF Program Committee, which plans the volunteer events. “It&#8217;s great to finally start to get back on track. We&#8217;ll hopefully be adding new dates to the calendar over the coming weeks, and look forward to new volunteers coming out to help where they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul Stermer, director of the Food Bank of the Hudson Valley, notes that in the past eight weeks they have distributed 50% more food than over the same time period last year. “That’s enough food for nearly three million meals to low-income families, unemployed or underemployed workers, service workers, out-of-school children, homebound and immuno-compromised seniors, shelter residents and others facing food insecurity—some for the first time,” he said.</p>
<p>The increased demand for emergency food has in turn, fueled a greater need for financial support to cover unplanned expenses, revenue shortfalls, and volunteers to sort donated food. “With the help of our incredible community partners, though, the Food Bank can continue to provide food to families struggling to make ends meet during this difficult time,” added Stermer.</p>
<p>The agency also offers other programs such as the BackPack Program. This helps alleviate child hunger by discreetly providing hungry children with backpacks full of nutritious and easy-to-prepare food on Friday afternoons, so they have food to eat throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>The Food Bank of the Hudson Valley receives several hundred thousand pounds of donated food and non-food items each week from the food industry. It also welcomes both food and financial donations. For more information, please visit. <a href="http://www.foodbankofthehudsonavalley.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.foodbankofthehudsonavalley.org</a></p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—On Tuesday, May 26th, segments of the construction and manufacturing sectors of the Mid-Hudson regional economy were allowed to go back to work after being shut down under Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s “New York on Pause” restrictions imposed in March to prevent the spread of the Novel Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo first announced on May 22 that pending the required training of contact tracers over the Memorial Day weekend, the Mid-Hudson regional economy could begin phase one of its economy’s reopening on Tuesday, May 26. The morning of May 26, Gov. Cuomo confirmed that a portion of the Mid-Hudson region’s economy was reopened after the region met all the necessary seven metrics related to COVID-19. Mid-Hudson became the eighth region in New York to reopen. Long Island reopened on Wednesday, May 27, leaving only New York City as the only region yet to qualify for phase one reopening.</p>
<p>For 86 days, the Mid-Hudson regional economy had been all but shut down, with the exception of essential businesses that included some segments of the construction industry, since the governor put “New York on Pause” on March 22. The real estate sector for the most part had to operate on a virtual basis. While some transactions have progressed to closing, sales have fallen sharply since the pandemic began in March. Second quarter sales statistics will be released by OneKey MLS in early July.</p>
<p>The first phase of the reopening loosens restrictions imposed back in March on the construction and manufacturing industries, as well as the wholesale supply chain. In addition, certain retail operations can be expanded for curbside pickup and drop-off or in-store pickup. The phase one designation also affects the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reopening has been different in different regions all across the state, but each region has to meet the same criteria to reopen and we are keeping New Yorkers informed with where each region stands,” Gov. Cuomo said. “We don&#8217;t want a region to reopen before its ready, and the Mid-Hudson Valley region has now met all the criteria necessary to begin reopening on Tuesday. This has been a tough situation, but New Yorkers are tough and we&#8217;ve shown how tough we really are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campgrounds and RV parks were allowed to open statewide over the Memorial Day weekend and veterinarian practices were allowed to open on May 26.</p>
<p>A major part of a significant construction project in the Hudson Valley—LEGOLAND New York—was shut down back in late March due to the governor’s executive order.</p>
<p>The governor’s Executive Order in March shut down the construction of the theme park, but did not halt infrastructure-related work, particularly on the construction of a new exit on Route 17 leading to the $350-million resort property.</p>
<p>It appears work will begin soon on the theme park, based on a statement released by the developer after the governor’s announcement that the Mid-Hudson was to enter phase one.</p>
<p>“We are excited LEGOLAND New York Resort has resumed construction for its 2021 opening following New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s approval for the Mid-Hudson Region to begin Phase 1 of reopening. Safety remains our highest priority and enhanced safety procedures to our operations have been introduced, in full compliance with the New York State requirements and best practice guidelines,” said Stephanie Johnson, general manager of LEGOLAND New York Resort.</p>
<p>The governor’s announcement of the reopening on May 26th for the Mid-Hudson was welcome news to business leaders, government officials and unemployed workers in the Mid-Hudson that have been anxiously awaiting the beginning of the phased reopening of the region.</p>
<p>In recent days, county executives and other politicos, including U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, have said the Mid-Hudson region was poised and ready to begin the first phase of the reopening.</p>
<p>“All of the cranes that you’ve seen that had to stop because they were not considered essential construction projects can now get restarted,” Westchester County Executive George Latimer said. “The men and women that work on those projects, the carpenters, the plumbers, the electricians, they go back to work.”</p>
<p>Rockland County Executive Ed Day said that post COVID-19, residents and some businesses now based in New York City may look at counties in the Mid-Hudson as an attractive lifestyle alternative.</p>
<p>“I think that folks in New York City are going to find places such as Westchester, Rockland and Orange and other counties in the Mid-Hudson region very attractive to them when they find they don’t have to go to New York City to work,” Day said. “They can come up to Westchester and Rockland and other places nearby and earn a living.”</p>
<p>It is believed that in two weeks the Mid-Hudson could qualify for phase two of the reopening, which would involve the professional services, retail, administrative support and real estate/rental and leasing sectors, which would bring the real estate industry from its current virtual status to in-person transactions, including showings.</p>
<p>It should be noted that governor’s office has stated that it has the discretion to move a region into another phase. Westchester County Executive George Latimer at a press conference on May 26 said he believes it will take at least two weeks for any region to qualify for an advancement to a higher phase.</p>
<p>Phase three involves restaurants/food services businesses and the final phase reopens segments of the arts / entertainment / recreation and education sectors.</p>
<p><strong>New $100M Small Business Loan Fund Launched</strong></p>
<p>On May 22, the governor announced the launch of the $100-million New York Forward Loan Fund to provide flexible and affordable loans to help small businesses, focusing on minority and women owned small businesses, that did not receive federal COVID-19 assistance.</p>

<p>The task force is co-chaired by Westchester County Legislator Catherine Parker, a former small business owner and past president of the Rye Chamber of Commerce, and Louis Lanza, a restaurateur with businesses in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive Latimer said, “What we have here is a group of individuals who have served in a variety of capacities, to serve in this particular capacity, to help organize our efforts to reach out to the businesses of Westchester County and do everything we can to help them reopen as fast as possible and as successfully as possible.”</p>
<p>Westchester, along with the entire Mid-Hudson region, recently entered phase one of the reopening process that included easing of restrictions for construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, retail (limited to curbside or in-store pickup or drop off), manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors.</p>
<p>The Mid-Hudson region entered phase two of the reopening process on Tuesday, June 9. Among the industries affected by the phase two designation are the real estate sector, along with offices, essential and phase two in-store retail, vehicle sales, leases, and rentals, retail rental, repair, and cleaning, commercial building management, hair salons and barbershops.</p>
<p>Latimer, noting that the metrics concerning COVID-19, such as the number of new cases and hospitalizations and deaths are all on the decline, said, “I have every reason to believe we are going to make phase two (on June 9).”</p>
<p>County Legislator Parker, who had been running for the Democratic nomination to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey, announced on May 29 that she was suspending her campaign.</p>
<p>“I see this reopening task force as a unified voice for all different sectors of business in Westchester County with the ‘rock stars’ of those sectors,” said Parker. “This will be a way to get Westchester back to where we were—and even better than before.”</p>
<p>Lanza said of the task force’s formation, “Restaurants are working ahead of the curve in getting ready everything they will need to do to open. We can do this safely. There are safe ways of running our businesses and once we get the go ahead, we can safely reopen and serve our customers.”</p>
<p>County officials note that the task force will play a significant role in communicating out to the business and nonprofit communities guidelines and best practices as the region enters each stage of phased reopening.</p>
<p>Other members of the Latimer administration that attended the press conference were: Bridget Gibbons, the director of economic development for Westchester County and Joan McDonald, Westchester County’s Director of Operations.</p>
<p>County officials added that the task force will also establish working groups that will focus on each critical area such as health care, labor, hospitality, general business, etc. These working groups will allow for all Westchester business owners to have an opportunity to give input.</p>
<p>The County Executive said that additional appointments to the task force and to the working groups may be forthcoming. Among the industries that will be focused on by the working groups include: real estate, health care, labor, hospitality and restaurants, among others, Latimer noted.</p>
<p>Among the task force members named at the press conference include: Ross Pepe and John Cooney of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc., Marsha Gordon and John Ravitz of The Business Council of Westchester; Michael Romita and Amy Allen of the Westchester County Association; Sean Meade, president of the Westchester Hotel Association; Peter Herrero, restauranteur; Janet Langsam of Arts Westchester; Carola Bracco of non-profit Neighbors Link; Jan Fisher of Nonprofit Westchester; Tom Carey of the AFL-CIO, Edward Doyle, president of the Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of Westchester; Susan Fox of White Plains Hospital; Lindsay Farrell of the Open Door Family Medical Center; Joseph Simone of Simone Development; Marty Berger of Saber Real Estate Advisors; Seamus Carey of Iona College; Edward Monroy of the Westchester Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; Nicholas Campbell of the Rivertowns Chamber of Commerce; Gayle Marchia of the Greater Ossining Chamber of Commerce; Catherine White from the New Rochelle Chamber of Commerce; Dr. Jim Bostic from the Nepperhan Community Center; Rabbi Daniel Groper of Community Synagogue of Rye and Rev. Erwin Trollinger of the Calvary Baptist Church.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the county’s largest business organizations—the Business Council of Westchester and the Westchester County Association—have also established task forces in connection with the phased reopening of the county’s economy.</p>
<p>Westchester County Board of Legislators Chairman Ben Boykin, who also attended the press conference, said of the county’s newly formed tas force, “This is an important challenge. We are in a place we have never been before and we must reopen in a more vibrant and smarter way so businesses can survive, grow and move to the next level.”</p>
<p>The first virtual meeting of the Reopening Task Force was scheduled on June 4 with future sessions expected to also be run virtually.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Today is the day real estate brokers and agents have been anxiously waiting for since March 22 when Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued the “New York on Pause” order that virtually shut down the real estate industry and all other “non-essential” businesses in the state.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this morning (June 9) that the Mid-Hudson region, which includes Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Dutchess, Sullivan and Ulster counties, entered phase two which lessen restrictions on real estate, offices, essential and phase II in-store retail, vehicle sales, leases, and rentals, retail rental, repair, and cleaning, commercial building management, hair salons and barbershops and now allows outdoor dining at restaurants.</p>
<p>The Mid-Hudson entered phase one of the reopening process on May 26, which loosened restrictions on the construction and manufacturing industries, as well as the wholesale supply chain. In addition, certain retail operations were eligible to be expanded for curbside pickup and drop-off or in-store pickup. The phase one designation also affected the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, but had no beneficial impact on the real estate industry, with the exception of real estate development construction.</p>
<p>The Mid-Hudson could be eligible for phase three of the four-phased reopening program on Tuesday, June 23, which will lift some restrictions on food service and personal care. The final phase (four) would impact arts/entertainment/recreation and educational sectors.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo, who noted that today was day 101 since the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the state, praised the work of government, health and business leaders for helping facilitate the phase two designation. “The numbers are down because you brought the numbers down,” he said. The governor noted that at the peak of COVID-19 back in April, the Mid-Hudson reported 75 deaths in one day. On June 8, there were no COVID-19 related deaths in the entire Hudson Valley region. Westchester County Executive George Latimer, in a later press conference, noted that there was one COVID-19 related death the previous evening in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Latimer chronicled the great progress the county and the Mid-Hudson region has achieved since the peak of the pandemic in April. He noted that two months ago on April 9, there were 44 COVID-related deaths in Westchester County. Since the pandemic began, there have been 1,396 deaths attributed to the coronavirus in Westchester.</p>
<p>He said that with the onset of phase two the county can “return to a reasonable place in our society, hopefully where we are fighting the contagion effectively, but at the same time we are starting to reopen businesses and really get back to something close to normal.”</p>
<p>Since the shutdown of the economy back in March, real estate professionals have tried to offer services and facilitate sale transactions on a virtual basis. The phase two designation lifts restrictions, but does mandate safety protocols, including social distancing. One key change with the phase two designation is that in-person real estate showings are now permissible as long as safety protocols are adhered to.</p>
<p>“The day we&#8217;ve all been yearning for is finally here! Many agents are jumping right in, with appointments already scheduled today. I expect that we are going to be as busy as we&#8217;ve ever been, with pent up buyer demand, sellers who&#8217;ve been waiting until now to put their homes on the market, and a lot more steps to every showing,” said HGAR President Gail Fattizzi.</p>
<p>She added, “As we begin meeting our clients in-person again, we must stay mindful that COVID-19 is still here, and take every precaution. HGAR intends to continue providing CE classes and holding meetings virtually, along with great free programs via Zoom. We should all expect that ‘re-opening’ is going to be a slow, steady process, not an instant change back to normal.”</p>
<p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty noted, “For 11 weeks the Realtor community has done our part, first by ‘pausing’ and then by shifting our business to a remote environment, in order to flatten the curve and slow the spread of COVID-19. That goal has been achieved and now it&#8217;s time to relaunch real estate, following the ESD guidance and with great concern for safety, and get the state economy relaunched.”</p>
<p>Other county and business leaders hailed the beginning of phase two as a milestone that will hopefully begin to relaunch the regional economy, now that New York City has entered phase one (yesterday).</p>
<p>John Ravitz, executive vice president of the Business Council of Westchester, said that the Westchester economy is still in uncharted waters and praised the business community for its resiliency to date in dealing with the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>“None of us knew what we were facing when the pandemic hit and so many different businesses in different sectors had to pivot; had to deal with their concerns for their employees, as well as their clients and customers,” Ravitz said. “I think what puts Westchester on the map throughout the country is the ingenuity and the creativity we have seen from our business leaders.”</p>
<p>Government officials talked of the work that has been done and the efforts that will need to be made to get their economies back on track.</p>
<p>“County government is doing everything humanly possible to assist these businesses as they reopen,” said Rockland County Executive Ed Day. “We have been sharing guidance with municipalities, local chambers of commerce and with businesses directly through our Office of Economic Development and Tourism. We have also hosted three business info livestreams to communicate critical information and promote Rockland’s tech sector.”</p>
<p>Day also noted that last week the county’s ROCK GOV – FACE COV program which gave out 25,000 masks to local small businesses and nonprofits which have fewer than 20 employees.</p>
<p>“Bottom line, we are working to ensure that businesses reopen in a way that is responsible and protects the health and safety of both their employees and customers,” he added.</p>
<p>Sullivan County government offices will slowly begin reopening to in-person visits, according to County Manager Josh Potosek. “We are bringing back less than 50% of our employees onsite, and offices will be open to the public by appointment only,” Potosek stated. “This is to ensure that the plan we’ve developed is workable and safe before we bring back more employees and reopen for walk-in customers—likely with the start of phase 3.”</p>
<p>The following is guidance from Empire State Development Corp. on In-Person Showings in Phase Two.</p>
<p>Residential In-Person Property Showings and Related Activities</p>
<p>Responsible Parties may conduct in-person property showings while adhering to social distancing and required PPE safety guidelines. The following measures must be followed:</p>
<p>• Showings and open houses will only be allowed in unoccupied (e.g., current owner or lessee is not inside the property) or vacant properties;</p>
<p>• For all showings and open houses, Responsible Parties should limit the number of individuals viewing a property at any one time. If multiple parties (from different households) arrive for a showing at the same time, Responsible Parties should encourage those in line to wait outside until their turn.</p>
<p>• As a best practice, appointments for showings should be scheduled in advance, when possible.</p>
<p>Responsible Parties as well as all individuals (e.g. building inspectors / appraiser or potential buyer/lessee) visiting the property will be required to wear a face covering at all times, and Responsible Parties may choose to require gloves and shoe-covers to be worn;</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties should provide face coverings and gloves to prospective tenants and/or buyers, if necessary;</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties should advise prospective tenants/buyers to only touch essential surfaces (e.g. handrails going up/down stairs if necessary) during their time in the property. Other areas or surfaces such as cabinets, countertops, appliances etc. should not be touched by tenants/buyers.</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties must ensure employees, salespeople, agents and brokers clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces (e.g. handrails, doorknobs etc.) before and after every showing; and</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties must stagger showings in order to avoid the congregation of people outside and inside properties.</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties are encouraged not to show common building amenities in-person (e.g. gym, roof deck, pool).</p>
<p>• If the common areas mentioned above are shown, Responsible Parties must ensure that those areas are frequently cleaned and disinfected and appropriate social distancing of 6 feet is maintained for all parties at all times.</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties should encourage only one party (e.g. building inspector, home appraiser, prospective tenant/buyer, photographer, stager) to be allowed inside the property at a time. If more than one party is inside the property at the same time, 6 feet of distance must be maintained at all times between individuals, and face coverings must be worn.</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties and prospective tenants/buyers are encouraged not to bring young children or extraneous guests to property showings, when possible, or leave attended children outside.</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties should limit salespeople / brokers from driving in the same car with prospective tenants / buyers. If this cannot be avoided, face coverings must be worn by everyone in the vehicle and frequently touched areas of the vehicle should be cleaned and disinfected.</p>
<p>• Open houses must also only allow one party inside the property at a time.</p>
<p>• Responsible Parties are encouraged, but not required, to conduct remote walkthroughs rather than<br />
in-person walkthroughs (e.g. recorded/live video), where possible.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[You are all encouraged to read the “Interim Guidance for Real Estate Services During the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency” and the “Real Estate Guidelines for Employers and Employees.” Both these documents are on the HGAR website (https://www.hgar.com/covid-19/covid-19-resources-and-videos).]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As you are all aware, the post Covid-19 reopenings are underway and the Mid-Hudson region is currently in Phase 2. There are many rules that New York State’s Department of Health has outlined as mandatory requirements and others as “best practices” that are strongly recommended. You are all encouraged to read the “Interim Guidance for Real Estate Services During the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency” and the “Real Estate Guidelines for Employers and Employees.” Both these documents are on the HGAR website (<a href="https://www.hgar.com/covid-19/covid-19-resources-and-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/covid-19/covid-19-resources-and-video</a>s).</p>
<p>While there are many rules and requirements for office reopening and requirements for employers and employees, today I will focus on the rules pertaining to agents and the conducting of showings and open houses. I will break this information down to what is mandatory, best practices, and additional materials.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Inspections/Appraisals/Walkthroughs: Accompanied showings and appraisals are permitted, so long as proper social distancing and PPE safety precautions are implemented, including the wearing of face coverings at all times.</p>
<p><strong>In-Person Showings:</strong> In-person showings are now permitted ONLY for properties that are unoccupied (occupant is not inside the property), or vacant. You may not show properties that have people in them at the time of the showing.</p>
<p><strong>Showing Common Areas:</strong> While the showing of common areas are discouraged, it is permissible. However, if a common area is shown, the agent must ensure that the area is frequently cleaned and disinfected and proper social distancing is maintained. Further, high-touch areas must be cleaned/disinfected by the agent. (See “Cleaning and Disinfecting” below).</p>
<p><strong>Number of Parties:</strong> For all SHOWINGS, the number of parties (people of different households) must be limited. For an OPEN HOUSE, <em>only one party at a time</em> (along with the agent) is permitted inside the property.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Distancing:</strong> A distance of at least six feet must be maintained between individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment:</strong> All individuals visiting a property must wear a face covering at all times. All visitors must be reminded to wear face coverings at all times during the visit, including while in common areas. No person should be permitted into a property without a face mask.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning/Disinfecting:</strong> All high-touch surfaces (e.g. handrails, doorknobs, etc.) are to be cleaned/disinfected by the agent <em>before and after every showing</em>. If common areas are shown, the agent must ensure that those areas are frequently cleaned and disinfected and all high-touch areas must be wiped down before and after the common area showing.</p>
<p><strong>Staggered Showings:</strong> Showings must be staggered to avoid a congregation of people in the area or outside.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong></p>
<p><strong>Showings/Open Houses:</strong></p>
<p>• Homeowners and landlords may still refuse to permit in-person showings or open houses.</p>
<p>• Individuals should be limited as much as possible. It is recommended that only one party (e.g. building inspector, home appraiser, prospective buyer/tenant, photographer, stager) be allowed inside at one time with the agent. Six-foot distancing must still be maintained at all times.</p>
<p>• If multiple parties (people from different households) arrive, they should be encouraged to wait outside, away from others, in a safe location (curb, car, etc.) until called.</p>
<p>• Appointments for showings should be scheduled in advance.</p>
<p>• Maintain a log of all visitors to open houses.</p>
<p>• Ample time should be afforded between visits for cleaning/disinfecting and in order to avoid contact between parties coming and going.</p>
<p>• Agents should remind parties to only touch essential surfaces (handrails, etc.) and not cabinets, countertops, appliances, etc.<br />
-It is recommended that common building amenities not be shown in-person (e.g. gym, roof deck, pool).</p>
<p>• A homeowner/landlord may restrict showings to only purchasers of record and necessary parties. Remember that it is illegal to prohibit children or the elderly from viewing a property, but it is recommended by NYSAR that their attendance be encouraged to be limited as much as possible due to medical concerns.</p>
<p>• Agent or homeowner/landlord should ensure that all necessary doors are open and that all required lights are on prior to visit.</p>
<p>• Post appropriate signage to provide information/instruction and clarify proper conduct.</p>
<p>• Walkthroughs: Remote walkthroughs are strongly encouraged where possible.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment</strong></p>
<p>• Gloves and shoes coverings can be required. If this is the case, this should be noted in the agent remarks and such supplies should be present at the site, if possible.</p>
<p>• Protective masks should be on hand to provide to parties who do not have masks. Remember, a party cannot be permitted entry if they are not wearing a face mask.</p>
<p>• Hand sanitizer should be made available before and after the visit.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing:</strong> The use of shared tool/materials (e.g. pens, paperwork, tape measures) should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature Check:</strong> All party’s (buyer/tenant) temperature should be taken prior to any showing/open house.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Questions</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended that, at a minimum, the following written screening questions should be provided to all parties (buyer/tenant/seller/landlord) and a response obtained prior to any visit as to whether the party has:</p>
<p>(1) Knowingly been in close or in proximate contact in the past 14 days with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or who has or had symptoms of COVID-19;</p>
<p>(2) Tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 14 days, or;</p>
<p>(3) Has experienced any symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 14 days.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the day of the visit, the following question should be asked:</p>
<p>(1) Has seller/landlord become symptomatic and/or tested positive for COVID-19 within 48 hours of the last visit to their property; and</p>
<p>(2) Has the buyer/tenant become symptomatic and/or tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>• It is further recommended that all screening questions be provided and responded to remotely in order to circumvent inadvertent and avoidable contact.</p>
<p>• If any party affirms possible exposure to COVID-19, the agent should take the appropriate action after consultation with their broker and then notify all necessary parties.</p>
<p>• If it is later learned that any party may have contracted COVID-19 at any time on or about the time of the visit, all necessary parties should be notified as determined by the brokerage.</p>
<p>• It is recommended that all records be kept confidential and be maintained for a period of time as determined by the brokerage.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Phase 2 Disclosure:</strong> It is recommended that the agent and client execute a COVID-19 Phase 2 disclosure, which should be retained for a period of time as determined by the brokerage.</p>
<p><strong>Driving with Clients:</strong> It is recommended that agents do not drive with prospective buyers/tenants and separate vehicles be utilized. In the event that this is not possible, face coverings must be worn by everyone in the vehicle and high-touch areas should be cleaned and disinfected before and after.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Materials</strong></p>
<p>It has been a while since many of us have conducted showings and/or open houses. Please be reminded that effective June 20, 2020, a Fair Housing disclosure must be provided to your client at first substantive contact and a Fair Housing Notice must be posted at all open houses. Copies of these documents are available on the HGAR website in the document directory (<a href="https://www.hgar.com/documents/fair-housing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/documents/fair-housing)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Overall, it is important to use extreme caution while conducting any in-person activities. Err on the side of caution, be well prepared, be concise in your execution, and be extremely conscientious of what you do, where you go, and what you touch. COVID-19 is still a real and present danger. Do not risk your health and the health of family and friends in your excitement to get back to work. We are all excited to jump into our new “business as usual,” but we need to reengage slowly. Be safe.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Update</strong></p>
<p>As many of you know, it has been a customary practice in many parts of New York State for tenants to reimburse landlords a “broker fee” or “commission” equal to a fixed amount when renting a property.</p>
<p>By way of background, in June, 2019, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law the Statewide Housing Security &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019 and the Housing Stability &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019. In January, the New York State Department of State published an updated guidance relating to these acts. That DOS Guidance stated that requesting a broker’s fee/commission from the tenant was not permissible.</p>
<p>In opposition to this guidance, NYSAR, REBNY, and other real estate brokerages filed a lawsuit. This lawsuit was opposed by the office of the New York State Attorney General. In February, the Attorney General obtained a temporary restraining order extending their time to answer.</p>
<p>Most recently, the office of the Attorney General again requested, and was granted, another extension of the temporary restraining order until at least Sept. 11, 2020.</p>
<p>As a result, and until such time that the matter is heard and resolved by the courts, a landlord/landlord’s agents will still be permitted to continue to request and collect a broker’s fee/commission from the tenant.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The PPP Flexibility Act provides additional relief to those businesses that have applied for and received loans under the Paycheck Protection Program instituted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Friday, June 5, 2020, President Trump signed the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Flexibility Act of 2020 (the “PPP Flexibility Act”) (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3dSbhNx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3dSbhNx</a>). The PPP Flexibility Act provides additional relief to those businesses that have applied for and received loans under the Paycheck Protection Program instituted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2XOhILW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2XOhILW</a>), which was signed into law on March 27th. Originally, an amount of $349 billion was allocated toward the PPP Loan and Emergency Injury Disaster Loan (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3dRh9qw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3dRh9qw</a>) programs, however, those funds ran out by April 16th.</p>
<p><strong>The CARES Enhancement Act</strong></p>
<p>On April 24, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act was signed into law and provided an additional $310 billion in funding to replenish the PPP and EIDL loan programs. This second round of funding also included a provision that earmarked $60 billion for community banks, smaller banks and credit unions that serve businesses in rural and minority areas, and it also allocated an additional $60 billion for the EIDL Loan program. The CARES Enhancement Act also made an additional $10 billion available for grants provided under the EIDL program.</p>
<p>The PPP Flexibility Act</p>
<p>The PPP Flexibility Act passed on June 5th provided critical relief to borrowers under the PPP Loan program by providing the following:</p>
<p>• Extends the period of time for borrowers to use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs.</p>
<p>• Extends the date for borrowers to rehire employees.</p>
<p>• Reduces the amount of payroll costs required for forgiveness of the loan.</p>
<p>• Modifies and extends the repayment period to repay loans that are not forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>Eight-Week Period Extended to 24 Weeks</strong></p>
<p>One significant change made to the CARES Act by the PPP Flexibility Act is that it extends the period of the time within which borrowers are required to use the loan funds to pay for qualified expenses (e.g., payroll, mortgage or loan interest, rent, and utilities). Originally, under the CARES Act, the borrowers had to use all of the loan proceeds toward qualified expenses within eight weeks of the date of disbursement of the loan proceeds in order to qualify for forgiveness. This period has now been extended to 24 weeks, providing the borrower with breathing room to use the loan proceeds for qualified expenses. This increases a borrower’s eligibility for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Previously, the rules and guidance issued by the Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) required that borrowers pay for qualified expenses within the eight-week period. The PPP Flexibility Act modified Section 1106(a)(3) of the CARES Act and now provides that “…the term ‘covered period’ means, subject to subsection (l), the period beginning on the date of the origination of a covered loan and ending the earlier of (A) the date that is 24 weeks after such date of origination; or (B) December 31, 2020.” It is important to note, however, that the deadline to apply for a loan under the PPP loan program still remains June 30, 2020. As of June 5th, there was still approximately $100 billion left in untapped funds.</p>
<p><strong>Forgiveness Available Even if Unable to Re-Hire</strong><br />
<strong> Employees and Some Key Dates Extended to Dec. 31</strong></p>
<p>Previously, in order for a borrower to qualify for forgiveness, the borrower was required to rehire furloughed employees by June 30, 2020. Under the PPP Flexibility Act, the June 30th deadline no longer applies. A borrower is now eligible for forgiveness if the borrower is able to document, in “good faith:”</p>
<p>“(i) an inability to rehire individuals who were employees of the eligible recipient on Feb. 15, 2020; and</p>
<p>(ii) an inability to hire similarly qualified employees for unfilled positions on or before Dec. 31, 2020.”</p>
<p>The borrower may also be eligible for forgiveness under new subsection (d)(7)(B) of Section 1106 of the CARES Act, if the borrower, in good faith, is able to document:</p>
<p><em>“…an inability to return to the same level of business activity as such business was operating at before Feb. 15, 2020, due to compliance with requirements established or guidance issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration during the period beginning on March 1, 2020, and ending Dec. 31, 2020, related to the maintenance of standards for sanitation, social distancing, or any other worker or customer safety requirement related to COVID–19.”</em></p>
<p>Therefore, if a borrower cannot return to pre-COVID-19 employee levels due to the above factors, the loan may be eligible for forgiveness. Eligibility requirements are now much less stringent and will serve to assist businesses and business owners tremendously.</p>
<p><strong>Payroll Threshold Reduced to 60% of Loan Proceeds From 75%</strong></p>
<p>Originally, under the CARES Act, the borrower was required to use at least 75% of the loan proceeds toward payroll expenses. The CARES Act also capped the amount of salary eligible for forgiveness to $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee; this $100,000 cap has not changed. The PPP Flexibility Act, however, now allows a borrower to be eligible for forgiveness if the borrower uses at least 60% (rather than 75%) of the loan proceeds for payroll costs. Newly added subsection (8) of Section 1106 of the CARES Act, provides as follows:</p>
<p><em>“(8) LIMITATION ON FORGIVENESS.—To receive loan forgiveness under this section, an eligible recipient shall use at least 60% of the covered loan amount for payroll costs, and may use up to 40% of such amount for any payment of interest on any covered mortgage obligation (which shall not include any prepayment of or payment of principal on a covered mortgage obligation), any payment on any covered rent obligation, or any covered utility payment.”</em></p>
<p>This change provides a borrower with greater flexibility as to the use of the loan proceeds to pay for qualified expenses. It is important to note that covered mortgage expenses do not include payments of principal.</p>
<p><strong>Deferral of Payments of Principal, Interest and Fees</strong><br />
<strong> And Repayment Term of Loan Under PPP Extended</strong></p>
<p>Under the CARES Act, and the previous regulations and guidance issued by the SBA, any payment of principal, interest and fees under the PPP loan was deferred for six months. The PPP Flexibility Act now extends the deferral period “…until the date on which the amount of forgiveness determined under section 1106 of the CARES Act is remitted to the lender.” The PPP Flexibility Act also provides that “[i]f an eligible recipient fails to apply for forgiveness of a covered loan within 10 months after the last day of the covered period defined in section 1106(a) of the CARES Act, such eligible recipient shall make payments of principal, interest, and fees on such covered loan beginning on the day that is not earlier than the date that is 10 months after the last day of such covered period.” Basically, this means that a borrower is required to apply for forgiveness. If the borrower does not apply within such 10-month period, then the borrower will not be required to begin making payments at any time prior to the expiration of such 10-month period.</p>
<p>Another important change implemented by the PPP Flexibility Act was the increase of the repayment term. Originally, the CARES Act provided that the “maturity date” of any part of a PPP loan amount not forgiven was two years. The PPP Flexibility Act extends the “maturity date” to five years. No changes were made to the interest rate of 1%.</p>
<p><strong>What Do Borrowers Do Now?</strong></p>
<p>Prior to the enactment of the PPP Flexibility Act, the SBA and lenders had already begun distributing loan forgiveness applications and procedures to borrowers. Many borrowers were under significant pressure to comply with the 75% payroll allocation requirements and the eight-week time frame provided under the original CARES Act, especially due to the inability of borrowers to get their employees to come back to work or remain at work. In most instances, many of the businesses that applied for the PPP loan were forced to shut down and were not permitted to operate altogether.</p>
<p>The fixes provided by the PPP Flexibility Act have alleviated significant pressure to comply with the original requirements of the CARES Act. It was one of the few times that Congress acted swiftly, and with little fanfare or controversy, in order to assist the business owners, and it was certainly needed. Lenders have indicated that the SBA will soon be providing updated forgiveness applications and amended procedures. It is important for borrowers to reach out to their lenders.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s no secret that COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on the commercial real estate market in the Hudson Valley, the nation, and the world. Small “mom and pop” stores, restaurants, bars, hotels, landlords, developers and even major retailers were all slammed by the three-month shut-down mandate to curb the spread of the deadly disease.</p>
<p>As a result, some of the most well-known U.S. national chains have filed for bankruptcy including Neiman Marcus, J.C. Penny, J. Crew, Modell’s, Gold’s Gym, Hertz, Tuesday Morning, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>The American Bankruptcy Institute indicates the total national commercial chapter 11 filings in May increased 48% from the previous year. Just last month, there were more than 700 chapter 11 filings across the country, as compared to just 487 in May of 2019.</p>
<p>Founded in 1982, ABI provides Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues. The ABI membership includes nearly 11,000 attorneys, accountants, bankers, judges, professors, lenders, turnaround specialists and other bankruptcy professionals.</p>
<p>“Companies that tried to shore up their balance sheets at the beginning of the year represent the initial wave of Chapter 11s due to the economic crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said ABI Executive Director Amy Quackenbush. “While the CARES Act and other measures have been successful in keeping consumers afloat during the crisis, mounting financial challenges may result in more households and companies seeking the shelter of bankruptcy.”</p>
<p>The good news for New York is that it has not ranked among the top five states with the highest per capital bankruptcy filing rates—Alabama, Tennessee, Delaware, Mississippi and Georgia.</p>
<p>As COVID cases continue to decline here in the Hudson Valley, and businesses slowly begin to reopen, it may be a wary waiting game to see just who will survive. Three months of no customers or no rental income may leave many small business owners and landlords in a precarious situation, despite the Paycheck Protection Program that allows them to pay their employees. Later, the rules changed to allow some of those funds to go toward rent or mortgage interests.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has created a domino effect for business owners and landlords, and we’re waiting to see just how it will affect the future of commercial financing,” said Robert Withers, president and CEO of M1 Capital in White Plains. “Small businesses like hair or nail salons haven’t had any income for three months, so they may have difficulty paying their rents. As a result, the landlords may not be able to make their mortgage payments on the buildings.”</p>
<p>Withers, who handles commercial loans and investments in the New York metro area and Florida, said in some cases, landlords are willing to extend leases, or use part of a security deposit to cover overdue rents. As for building owners who are late on mortgage payments, those payment terms will tend to vary with each lender.</p>
<p>Concerning new commercial loans, Withers admits it’s an open book. “The lending environment now is very sketchy,” he explained. “Buying any sort of commercial property today is not for the faint of heart, or those with shallow pockets.”</p>
<p>In the post-COVID climate, Withers said, many lenders require holding at least 12 months’ worth of payments in escrow, so that they can receive continuous payments for a year, should there be any problems collecting rents from tenants. This is most often the case for anyone buying a building with retail units. “Never have financials of both building owners or tenants been under such scrutiny,” he added.</p>
<p>Restaurants, he predicted, may also be among the vulnerable. “While some are surviving on take out, once they open, they’ll still have to keep tables at least six feet apart, and may be operating at half capacity,” he said. “For many, it’s going to be very challenging to stay afloat operating in that situation.”</p>
<p>Gyms, malls, and even office buildings may also suffer in the aftermath of COVID. “Think of all the places where large groups of people gather in close proximity,” said Withers. “I don’t think people are going to be rushing back there.” As a result, he predicts a glut of office buildings and “big box.” spaces flooding the commercial real estate market, and the need for creative financing to repurpose those spaces.</p>
<p>Jim Lanfranchi, senior vice president and team leader with Webster Bank’s Business Group in White Plains, agreed that as the workplace changes in the post-COVID era, there may be a significant decrease in demand for ultra large office spaces. “A lot of companies may realize they don’t need as much space, if most of their employees can rotate their shifts and work from home,” he said. “I think that investors in office and retail will have to re-examine their portfolios and assess future demands.”</p>
<p>Developers and investors seeking commercial loans in the current climate are now looking at a coughing up much larger down payments on properties. Before the virus, the average LTV was a maximum of 70%, but now it’s been reduced to a maximum of 65%. “There is definitely an increased scrutiny on liquid assets when it comes to retail and residential multi-family properties,” said Lanfranchi.</p>
<p>For those struggling to repay loans, Lanfranchi said most banks do offer some type of a deferral program. “Sometimes it may be a deferral on interest payments, principal, or principal and interest—whatever is easier for the borrower,” he explained. “However, the updated PPP regulations have really helped investors, now that their tenants can earmark 40% of those funds for rental payments.”</p>
<p>Webster Bank’s commercial lending division has never been aggressive with retail or multi-family developments, but instead has concentrated on the industrial sector—factories, warehouses, flex industrial, and medical buildings. “Medical offices are like Chinese restaurants, pizzerias and nail salons—you have to go there if you want the food or service,” said Lanfranchi. Headquartered in Waterbury, CT, Webster Bank currently offers 157 banking centers between Westchester and Boston, with 22 commercial banking offices.</p>
<p>Most lenders today are also taking a closer look at an investor’s experience. “It’s important to know when they starting investing and how they’ve been able to handle vacancies,” he added. “Those with excellent liquidity may be able to get a 20-year fixed rate loan with rates in the low to mid 3% range.”</p>
<p>As the commercial real estate market hovers toward stabilization, some still fear a resurgence of COVID-19 for the fall and early 2021. ABI is already bracing itself for more possible bankruptcies, should the virus return in full force. “As financial challenges continue to escalate amid this crisis, bankruptcy is sure to offer a financial safe harbor from the economic storm,” added Quackenbush.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The new listing search portal offers consumers more than 40,000 listings and some 500 communities throughout the New York Metropolitan area, making it the largest selection of for sale and lease listings from Realtors in New York State.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The first regional MLS in the New York Metro area, OneKey MLS, has announced the launch of its new consumer search website—<a href="http://onekeymls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneKeyMLS.com</a>.</p>
<p>The new listing search portal offers consumers more than 40,000 listings and some 500 communities throughout the New York Metropolitan area, making it the largest selection of for sale and lease listings from Realtors in New York State.</p>
<p>The new MLS was created by the Long Island Board of Realtors, Inc. and the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc.</p>
<p>OneKey MLS, which went live for Realtors in March, offers robust property search tools in 21 languages. Consumers are able to save searches and listings, and can share their favorites with friends and family. Every user can sign up to receive alerts on new listings, open houses and saved searches.</p>
<p>“OneKey MLS was created to not only provide Realtors access to innovative tools that will help them do better business, but to also make the property buying or leasing process easier for consumers,” said Jim Speer, CEO of OneKey MLS. “We are thrilled to reach this next milestone in our rollout and look forward to consumers using the site to find their new home.”</p>
<p>The easy-to-use platform features an intuitive, map-based search, beautiful images and in-depth property remarks so consumers can learn all there is to know about each listing. Every listing is accompanied by information about nearby properties and recent sales in the area as well as extensive demographic, school and lifestyle data from more than 100 sources. Since the site is updated every five minutes straight from the MLS, consumers can be assured that every listing is always accurate.</p>
<p>“Since OneKey MLS was formed, we have been committed to offering Realtors and consumers alike the most accurate listing data available,” said Richard Haggerty, president of OneKey MLS and CEO of Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. “We have worked tirelessly to create a platform that will become the most trusted residential real estate resource and we look forward to consumers being able to experience it.”</p>
<p>Recognizing that real estate is about more than a transaction, for both consumers and brokers/agents, OneKey MLS goes beyond reliable, up-to-date property listings. The platform gives real estate professionals and their clients unprecedented access to properties from Montauk to Manhattan, to the Lower Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—At press time, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. and the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors, Inc. have scheduled votes of their respective memberships to approve a proposed merger of the two Realtor organizations, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has learned.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors has scheduled a special virtual meeting on July 1 to approve the merger deal as well as necessary bylaws amendments to facilitate the merger deal. The merger plan also calls for the creation of the Bronx Chapter of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc., with a Chapter representative serving on the HGAR Board of Directors in accordance with the amended bylaws. Vincent Buccieri of Today Realty Corp. will serve as the Bronx Chapter representative until Dec. 31, 2020 if the merger is approved by members of both organizations. Buccieri currently serves as the president of BMNAR.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of HGAR and BMNAR have approved the merger transaction in separate votes. The BMNAR Board of Governors approved the proposed merger with HGAR at a virtual session on Thursday, May 21. The Board of Directors of HGAR and BMNAR have approved the merger deal, including proposed bylaws amendments by HGAR, in separate votes.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong><em><strong> <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/notice-of-special-meeting-of-the-members-of-the-hudson-gateway-association-of-realtors-inc-july-1-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See Official Notice of Special Meeting</a></strong>. The Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors has scheduled a virtual Zoom meeting to approve the proposed merger transaction on Thursday, June 18.</em></p>
<p>The proposed merger is the result of negotiations between the two associations that began more than a year ago. HGAR President Gail Fattizzi said the deal would be a “win-win” for both HGAR and BMNAR and is” natural fit” for HGAR as BMNAR’s footprint lies between the rest of Manhattan and Westchester, areas already represented by HGAR. She noted that many Bronx Realtors, particularly residential practitioners, are currently members of HGAR and/or participants of OneKey MLS, so synergies already exist. The deal would also add veteran Bronx-Manhattan commercial brokers that will strengthen HGAR’s Commercial Investment Division.</p>
<p>“The geography makes perfect sense, but there are many other clear benefits that will make this merger mutually advantageous,” <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/viewpoints/presidents-corner-hgar-to-grow-with-next-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Fattizzi states in her column in this month’s edition of</strong><em><strong> Real Estate In-Depth</strong></em></a>. “HGAR has an extensive history of legislative advocacy throughout our geography. BMNAR’s strengths include years of dynamic relationships with local politicians, community leaders and housing advocates in the Bronx and Manhattan. Uniting forces gives us even greater strength in both numbers and influence,” Fattizzi noted.</p>
<p>“The BMNAR has had tremendous history of leadership and advocacy for Realtor interests for decades. This merger brings together two strong organizations who have collaborated very effectively in the past on common goals and issues,” said HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty. “It’s truly a win-win for our respective memberships.”</p>
<p>HGAR has served the New York real estate community since 1916 with the formation of the Westchester County Realty Board. The present-day Realtor organization is the result of six local New York associations coming together to build a better, bigger and stronger organization for its members.</p>
<p>In 1947, the Pelham Realty Board merged with the Westchester County Realty Board. In 2009, the pace of consolidation took on speed, first with the Putnam County Association of Realtors, followed by the Rockland County Board of Realtors and the Orange County Association of Realtors in 2011. With those two merger deals, the association formally became the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and HGMLS.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Manhattan Association of Realtors merged with HGAR, increasing the association’s coverage area to include the city. Earlier this year the association’s MLS merged with LIBOR’s MLS to become OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>The roots of the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors date back to 1924. The association, which is headquartered at 1867 Williamsbridge Road, is the local chapter for the New York State and National Association of Realtors. In 1997, NAR approved its expanded jurisdiction to include both the Bronx and Manhattan. The merger transaction would also involve the purchase of the three-story BMNAR headquarters building.</p>
<p>BMNAR CEO Eliezer Rodriguez, who has led the organization since 2013, will join HGAR to assist with the expanded organization’s legislative advocacy agenda and the development of a stronger CID. Rodriguez succeeded Nunzio Del Greco, RCE, who led BMNAR from 1983 through 2012.</p>
<p>Rodriguez told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that BMNAR currently boasts approximately 175 Realtor members and affiliates. The merger deal with HGAR will also include the 31-member offices of the Bronx-Northern Manhattan Association of Realtors’ MLS, which will join OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>Noting that HGAR has grown over the past decade with multiple merger transactions, Rodriguez noted that the merger process has been a lot smoother than he had first expected.</p>
<p>“Initially when we started the negotiations two years ago I thought it would be more complicated than it turned out to be&#8230; But, the (BMNAR) membership responded and thought that this was a good move,” Rodriguez noted.</p>
<p>He also related that members of the Bronx association will be able to maintain their identity as Bronx-based Realtors and small business owners once they become members of HGAR, which was a key consideration by members of BMNAR.</p>
<p>“We chose HGAR for several reasons,” Rodriguez said. “The primary reason is that we thought they were in a better place to help our membership since a lot of our members are already members of HGAR, so it made sense to move in that direction.”</p>
<p>He added that adding HGAR’s services platform is another key benefit for BMNAR members and that the deal with HGAR made sense because the association wanted to maintain its affiliation with the National Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors and its adherence to the NAR Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>If both memberships approved the proposal, the merger will not become effective until it is green-lighted by the New York State Attorney General’s office and the National Association of Realtors.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Consumers now have access to a listing search portal that boasts approximately 40,000 listings from some 500 communities throughout the New York metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Officials with OneKey MLS staged a virtual press conference on Monday, June 22 to announce that the consumer-facing MLS platform, which provides real estate professionals and their clients unprecedented access to properties on the MLS—from Montauk to Manhattan, to the Lower Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains—had gone live that day.</p>
<p>The timing of the announcement came as New York City entered phase two of the state’s reopening process and one day before the Mid-Hudson entered phase three. The real estate industry reopens once a region enters phase two, which allows open houses to be held as long as safety protocols are adhered to.</p>
<div id="attachment_32633" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Speer-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32633" class="wp-image-32633" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Speer-1.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="333" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32633" class="wp-caption-text">Jim Speer, CEO of OneKey MLS</p></div>
<p>OneKey MLS was formed in 2018, following the merger of the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service and the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The MLS features properties from Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Dutchess counties, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Nassau and Suffolk counties. At press time, there were more than 1,200 Manhattan listings available on <strong><a href="http://onekeymls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneKeyMLS.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>“OneKey MLS was created to not only provide Realtors access to innovative tools that will help them do better business, but to also make the property buying or leasing process easier for consumers,” said Jim Speer, CEO of OneKey MLS. “We are thrilled to reach this next milestone in our rollout and look forward to consumers making OneKeyMLS.com the one site they use to find their new home.”</p>
<div id="attachment_32634" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Haggerty-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32634" class=" wp-image-32634" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Haggerty-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="361" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32634" class="wp-caption-text">Richard Haggerty, President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer of OneKey MLS</p></div>
<p>OneKey MLS’s approximately 42,000-plus subscribers serve Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Orange, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p>
<p>Along with Speer, other OneKey MLS officials who participated in the on-line press conference were Richard Haggerty, president and chief strategic growth officer, and Leah Caro, chairman of the Board of Managers. Tracy Weir, founder and managing partner of August Partners, the designer of the consumer search website, provided a comprehensive presentation on the many features available for consumers on the site. The robust property search tools are offered in 21 languages. Consumers are able to save searches and listings, and can share their favorites with friends and family. Every user can sign up to receive alerts on new listings, open houses and saved searches and can review extensive profiles on communities, school districts, etc.</p>
<div id="attachment_32636" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Caro-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32636" class=" wp-image-32636" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Caro-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="341" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32636" class="wp-caption-text">Leah Caro,Chairman of the Board of Manager of OneKey MLS</p></div>
<p>Speer and Haggerty, who is also chief executive officer of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, shared that the origin of the regional MLS for the New York metro region began during a meeting in Albany about three years ago and centered on the market area both LIBOR and HGAR serve.</p>
<p>“We looked at the geography of New York City and the greater suburban area and we recognized this is some of the most powerful geography in the world and shouldn’t we leverage the power of this geography for the benefit of our members so they can better serve their consumer clients?” Haggerty said.</p>
<p>One of the keys to launching OneKey MLS was a commitment to providing the latest and most accurate data available.</p>
<div id="attachment_32635" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Weir-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32635" class=" wp-image-32635" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Weir-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="343" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32635" class="wp-caption-text">Tracy Weir, Founder and Managing Partner of August Partners</p></div>
<p>Haggerty, added, “We have worked tirelessly to create a platform that will become the most trusted real estate resource in New York and we look forward to consumers being able to experience it.”</p>
<p>Caro, who is also president of Park Sterling Realty in Bronxville, noted that the OneKey MLS website is updated every five minutes. Another key feature of the consumer-facing website is that only the listing agent and broker of a listing are shown.</p>
<p>She added that OneKey MLS provides “clean data, deep data and timely data.”</p>
<p>The easy-to-use platform features an intuitive, map-based search, beautiful images and in-depth property remarks so consumers can learn all there is to know about each listing. Listings are accompanied by information about nearby properties and recent sales in the area as well as extensive demographic, school and lifestyle data from more than 100 sources.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and co-sponsor TitleVest recently assembled a panel of powerhouse New York City residential brokerage executives who offered candid assessments of the area’s real estate markets now and going forward and what the real estate industry must do in this time of civil unrest.</p>
<div id="attachment_32667" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RICHARD-HAGGERTY.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32667" class="wp-image-32667" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RICHARD-HAGGERTY.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="176" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32667" class="wp-caption-text">Richard Haggerty, CEO HGAR</p></div>
<p>The online panel discussion held on June 25 entitled “Getting the Deal Done: Real Estate Transaction Best Practices as NYC Re-Opens” featured panelists: Scott Durkin, president and CEO of Douglas Elliman; Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens; and Gary Malin, COO of The Corcoran Group. The moderator for the program was Brian Tormey, president of TitleVest, and the host was HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty.</p>
<p>Haggerty began the program with the latest home sales data from OneKey MLS on residential transactions in its market area that covers Long Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and the Hudson Valley counties of Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam and Sullivan counties.</p>
<p>In the previous 24 hours, 728 new listings were entered into the OneKey MLS system and 156 closings (title transfers) occurred, Haggerty reported. In the previous week, 3,829 new listings were entered and 993 transactions closed (title transfers) took place.</p>
<p>In response, TitleVest’s Tormey noted, “That is really encouraging and heartwarming to know that there is that much activity.”</p>
<p>The broker panel for the most part agreed that activity is brisk in New York City on the rental apartment market, but are unsure how healthy the sales market will be, noting that New York City just recently entered phase two to allow agents to conduct personal showings.</p>
<div id="attachment_32663" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BRIAN-TORMEY.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32663" class=" wp-image-32663" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BRIAN-TORMEY.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="180" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32663" class="wp-caption-text">Brian Tormey, President TitleVest</p></div>
<p>In terms of the rental market, Malin said, “There is an avalanche of inventory hitting the market. More inventory than I have ever seen hit the market at one time.”</p>
<p>He noted that a manager of his firm’s Brooklyn office told him listings in that office had risen from 3,000 in March to 7,500.</p>
<p>“Every (building) owner is dealing with tremendous amounts of inventory and they are going to need to understand that the market is in a moment of change and they are going to need to moderate pricing and they are also going to need to moderate concessions,” Malin said.</p>
<p>He added that landlords in this environment who stand firm on prices “will be holding onto vacancies far longer than they anticipated.” Malin said tenants will be shopping around looking for the best prices and concession packages.</p>
<p>Freedman said that because of the plethora of options for tenants, landlords will have to be reasonable in terms of pricing.</p>
<p>She said the same holds true in the sales market. “There is going to be a sort of a day of reckoning and a correction, but we are here to help them do that.”</p>
<div id="attachment_32665" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTT-DURKIN.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32665" class="wp-image-32665" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTT-DURKIN.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="177" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32665" class="wp-caption-text">Scott Durkin, President and CEO Douglas Elliman</p></div>
<p>Freedman described the current climate as an “opportunity environment across the board” for renters and buyers in New York City.</p>
<p>She said that while agents are reporting to her they are showing listings non-stop and starting to put deals together, she noted it is too early to tell how vibrant the sales market in New York City will be a few months from now.</p>
<p>“I think it is going to take a little bit of time, I expect, in New York because we are also super-sensitive to what is going on in the country regarding COVID. We are seeing an uptick in all these states that may not been as responsible in certain areas,&#8221; Freedman said.</p>
<p>She expects the sales market to be “decent” going forward, due to pent-up demand. “I don’t think it is going to be crazy, Freedman predicted. “I think we’ll be O.K., and I have said before, I am O.K. with O.K. I will take O.K.”</p>
<p>Among the hot markets at the moment are: the Hamptons on Long Island, Fairfield County, CT; Palm Beach, FL and Rhinebeck in Dutchess County.</p>
<p>She added that a spike in COVID hospitalizations and deaths in New York that would prompt Gov. Andrew Cuomo to reinstate the “New York on Pause” restrictions “would be a nightmare and would be a worst-case scenario” for the New York City real estate market, Freedman related.</p>
<div id="attachment_32664" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BESS-FREEDMAN.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32664" class=" wp-image-32664" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BESS-FREEDMAN.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="167" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32664" class="wp-caption-text">Bess Freedman, CEO Brown Harris Stevens</p></div>
<p>Freedman, who noted that Brown Harris Stevens lost an agent to the coronavirus, said “Wearing a mask is not about politics, it’s just about safety. It’s about protecting yourself. It’s not right versus left, it is right versus wrong and taking care of each other.”</p>
<p>Durkin said in discussions with brokers and agents from other real estate brokerage firms, they say some are very active while others are reporting little business.</p>
<p>“There is no middle ground here,” he said. “People are very decisive now in terms of what they need and I think the access being limited as it is, even now in phase two, in many ways the agents know how to work around it now and the buyers are also willing to not obsess over things they cannot control right now,” Durkin shared.</p>
<p>He said that real estate professionals in New York have, since COVID restrictions were put in place, “learned how to deal with this and I think we are able to move faster and smarter right now than we ever have been.”</p>
<p>In terms of COVID’s impact on Douglas Elliman’s national footprint, Durkin related that about an hour before the program began, he ordered his Houston office shut down due to the significant spike in COVID-19 new cases there. He added that South Florida and California, where the firm also has operations, are also seeing new outbreaks of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Luckily, people have not been coming into the office, Durkin related. “So, they are staying away.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Black Lives Matter’</strong></p>
<p>Freedman, Malin and Durkin agreed that while the real estate industry embraces diversity, more needs to be done, especially in terms of key leadership positions.</p>
<p>Freedman noted that while there is work to done to help foster more diversity in the real estate industry, the “Black Lives Matter” movement has raised awareness of the issue.</p>
<div id="attachment_32668" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GARY-MALIN.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32668" class="wp-image-32668" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GARY-MALIN.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="172" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-32668" class="wp-caption-text">Gary Malin, COO The Corcoran Group</p></div>
<p>“I think when it comes to ‘Black Lives Matter’ and what is going on in the real estate space, I know that we all believe in equality, but I think we have not done a great job in having a good representation of enough diversity in the leadership arena.”</p>
<p>She added, “It is one thing to believe in equality, but to create opportunities is another thing and I know for myself at Brown Harris Stevens, we need to do a lot more…”</p>
<p>Malin agreed with Freedman and said it is important that real estate executives “listen and learn and really take stock of where we are and more importantly where we need to go. There are going to be some difficult and uncomfortable conversations, but those conversations are important to have. That is how you move things forward.”</p>
<p>He added that diversity needs to be a concerted effort to foster real change in the industry.</p>
<p>Durkin related that “Black Lives Matter” “is not a moment, this is a movement and I think it is important for us to embrace that and we are certainly looking within the company at being much more diverse.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—In a 37-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge C.J. McMahon denied a request by a group of Westchester County residential landlords to impose a temporary restraining order on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Executive Order that extended a moratorium on evictions of commercial and residential tenants due to the coronavirus pandemic until Aug. 20, 2020.</p>
<p>The three litigants—Elmsford Apartment Associates, LLC, 36 Apartment Associates, LLC and 66 Apartment Associates, LLC own properties in Elmsford, Port Chester and Yonkers—filed suit on May 25 in U.S. District Court in White Plains seeking a temporary restraining order and summary judgement on the litigation contesting the moratorium extension that allows tenants to temporarily apply their security deposit funds to rents due and owing—provided the tenants replenish those funds at a later date.</p>
<p>The Executive Order also temporarily prohibits landlords from initiating eviction proceedings against tenants who are facing financial hardship due to the pandemic. The original Executive Order went into effect on March 20. The Executive Order, issued on May 7, extended the prohibition of residential and commercial evictions from June 20 for another 60 days until Aug. 20, 2020.</p>
<p>Judge McMahon denied the Westchester landlord group’s multiple arguments, including its claim that the moratorium constituted the state’s physical and regulatory “taking” of the properties and granted the state summary judgement and dismissed the case.</p>
<p>“As long as the order is in place, tenants will continue to accrue arrearages, which the landlord will be able to collect with interest once the Order has expired,” Judge McMahon stated in his June 29th ruling. “Furthermore, landlords will regain their ability to evict tenants once the Order expires. Since EO 202.28 is temporary on its face, and does not disturb the landlords’ ability to vindicate their property rights, the Order is one more example of “government regulation of the rental relationship [that] does not constitute a physical taking.”</p>
<p>The judge also took on the group’s contention that the eviction extension order violates its due process rights.</p>
<p>“First, they can still initiate eviction proceedings against the tenants who are not facing financial hardship but who have chosen not to pay their rent. And, second, they will be able to move against their other tenants after August 19,” the judge stated. “No case says that ‘a meaningful time’ means as soon as a cause of action accrues—especially where, as in New York, the filing of a summary proceeding is but the first step in what often takes years to accomplish, which is the ultimate eviction of a tenant. Therefore, the delay embodied mandated by the Order does not deny the Plaintiffs a meaningful opportunity to be heard.”</p>
<p>In a report previously published in<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/commercial/westchester-landlord-group-files-suit-against-governors-exec-order-extending-eviction-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong> Real Estate In-Depth</strong></em></a>, the three litigants were not fully identified in the court action or by their attorney Mark A. Guterman, a partner in the White Plains-based law firm Lehrman, Lehrman &amp; Guterman, LLP.</p>
<p>In court papers, Elmsford Apartment Associates is described as the owner of rental properties containing a combined 29 units at 7 Paulding St. and 37 North Hillside Ave. in Elmsford. The entity 36 Apartment Associates is the fee owner of residential rental properties at 344 Irving Ave., 350 Irving Ave., 171 Rectory St., 42 Arnett St. and 58 Prospect St. in Port Chester. The five properties contain a total of 36 residential rental units. The remaining litigant, 66 Apartment Associates, is the fee owner of 45 condominium units at the Park Crest West Condominium at 66 Caryle Ave. in Yonkers.</p>
<p>“The order has given carte blanche to tenants to withhold rent without immediate repercussion,” the plaintiffs charged in court papers.</p>
<p>Guterman in a telephone interview with <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> prior to the court ruling, said, “With the (court) filing we hope to get the attention of the governor. We don’t want wholesale eviction of tenants, nobody wants that. But, what we want principally is that the rights of the landlords under their leases and under the law be respected.”</p>
<p>He added, “There is no other industry in which private parties are told you bear the burden of society and we the government are not going to help you out.”</p>
<p>While citizens and other businesses can make applications for COVID-19-related relief, the landlord’s tax and other business obligations remain intact. “It’s not fair, it’s not constitutional,” Guterman charged.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The membership of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. that participated in a more than two-hour virtual Special Meeting today, overwhelmingly approved a merger agreement with the Bronx Manhattan-North Association of Realtors, Inc.</p>
<p>The more than 400 members who participated in the session, held via Zoom, also approved a number of bylaws amendments that were necessary to facilitate the merger, along with other changes, including codifying the association’s commitment to diversity.</p>
<p>The merger plan also calls for the creation of the Bronx Chapter of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc., with a Chapter representative—Vincent Buccieri of Today Realty Corp. serving on the HGAR Board of Directors in accordance with the amended bylaws. Buccieri will serve as the Bronx Chapter representative until Dec. 31, 2020. Buccieri currently serves as the president of BMNAR. The merger is now subject to final due diligence by HGAR and must be approved by the National Association of Realtors, as well as the New York State Attorney General’s Office.</p>
<p>The membership of BMNAR unanimously approved the merger deal with HGAR in a virtual session via Zoom on Thursday, June 17.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of HGAR and BMNAR previously approved the merger transaction in separate votes. The Board of Directors of HGAR also approved the proposed bylaws amendments.</p>
<p>BMNAR CEO Eliezer Rodriguez, who has led the organization since 2013, will join HGAR to assist with the expanded organization’s legislative advocacy agenda in the Bronx and New York City and the development of a stronger Commercial Investment Division.. Rodriguez, succeeded Nunzio Del Greco, RCE, who led BMNAR from 1983 through 2012.</p>
<p>BMNAR currently boasts approximately 200 Realtor members and affiliates. The merger deal with HGAR will also include the 31-member offices of the Bronx-Northern Manhattan Association of Realtors’ MLS, which will join OneKey MLS. When the deal is finalized, HGAR will have a membership of more than 12,000. The merger will increase HGAR’s territory to the entire borough of the Bronx and from 145th St. north in Manhattan, which now gives HGAR full coverage of the borough of Manhattan, according to HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty.</p>
<p>The merger transaction also involves the three-story BMNAR headquarters building at 1867 Williamsbridge Road. Haggerty said HGAR will house its Bronx operations there and may undertake some renovations to the property.</p>
<p>Prior to the respective merger and bylaws votes, members and the HGAR Executive Committee, staff and legal counsel John Dolgetta engaged in far-ranging question and answer sessions with members.</p>
<p>The participants approved the merger deal with 86% of the participants voting in favor of the merger.</p>
<p>The bylaws changes met with 89% of the participants’ approval.</p>
<p>HGAR President Fattizzi related that while discussions concerning a possible merger began more than two years ago, talks accelerated about eight or nine months ago, leading to the proposed agreement. She noted that some of the advantages to the transaction include bridging the geography of HGAR’s reach between Westchester and Central Manhattan, “joining forces for greater political and legislative advocacy, help with expanding our Commercial Investment Division, welcoming their loyal Affiliate members and bringing in new talent to our organization,” she said.</p>
<p>Haggerty added, “I could not be more excited about finally bringing this to fruition.” He noted that the deal will combine two organizations whose respective strengths meshed effectively.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the deal will strengthen HGAR’s legislative advocacy in terms of rent control and other key legislation in New York City.</p>
<p>“We really feel that this merger is bringing together two very strong organizations to create an even stronger organization,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>HGAR Office to Reopen on July 6</strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[Hudson Valley Home Sales Take Hit from Coronavirus]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS— The optimism felt by residential real estate practitioners in the first quarter of 2020 when strong sales figures in the lower Hudson Valley region, served by OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC, seemed to be an indication of a robust year ahead for residential real estate sales. This optimism took an abrupt left turn in the second quarter when fears and uncertainty created by COVID -19 took hold, according to the<strong> <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OneKey-MLS-2nd-Qtr-2020-Real-Estate-Market-Report-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 Second Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report</a> </strong>Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan Counties, New York released on July 7.</p>
<p>On March 7th, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency and as of March 20th all non-essential businesses were closed. This closure affected the ability of real estate practitioners to show properties, home inspectors to conduct inspections and attorneys to conduct closings in their offices.</p>
<p>Initially stunned, the creativity and resiliency of agents and brokers along with the enhanced use of technology created a slow but sure path forward. Agents began conducting business online, showing homes virtually. New York State permitted notary services online and attorneys conducted business in parking lots going between cars. Although sales figures still took a significant hit, continuing demand could result in a fairly rapid recovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Q2-2020-Residential-Sales-Chart.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-32702" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Q2-2020-Residential-Sales-Chart.png" alt="" width="826" height="610" /></a></p>
<p>Residential sales figures were down anywhere from a high of 39.8% in Bronx County (hardest hit by COVID-19), which translates to a total of 296 total residential sales compared to 492 sales in the second quarter of 2019 to a low of 6.2% in Putnam County, which translates to 258 sales as compared to 275 sales in Q2-2019.</p>
<p>More reflective of how home sales fared was Westchester County where residential sales were down 27.6% or 1,805 sales as compared to 2,493 sales in the second quarter of 2019; Orange County residential sales were down 27.9% or 742 sales as compared to 1,029 sales in Q2-2019; Rockland County sales were down 24.1% or 482 sales compared to 635 sales in Q2-2019 and Sullivan County sales fell 13.7% or 196 sales compared to 227 sales in Q2-2019.</p>
<p>Percentage declines for single-family residential sales, as compared to Q2-2019, closely mirrored the overall drops with Putnam County down 6.6%; Sullivan County 10.6% lower; Westchester County down 21.3%; Rockland County lower by 22.1% and Orange County sales fell 26.5%.</p>
<p>Single-family residential sales prices did not reflect the turmoil wrought by COVID-19 and were, in fact, up in every county covered by OneKey™ MLS with the exception of Putnam County, which experienced a relatively small decrease of 1.1% in median price. The median price in Putnam was $359,900 as compared to $365,000 one year ago. Sales prices increased 17.7% in Sullivan to $175,000; 6.7% in Rockland to $480,000; 12.5% in Orange to $298,000 and 1.2% in Westchester to $711,000. The median sales price is the midpoint price at which 50% of sales were higher and 50% of sales were lower.  <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Q2-2020-Median-Sales-Price.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-32703" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Q2-2020-Median-Sales-Price.png" alt="" width="813" height="584" /></a></p>
<p>At this juncture it would be difficult, at best, to make any predictions about market conditions going forward. Anecdotally, we know that interest and demand have been high and brokers report that there are multiple offers on properties, many above asking price. It appears that the suburban market, as well as the exurban market, are the beneficiaries of city dwellers who no longer wish to be living in such close proximity to others or who, at least, want a second home to “escape” to. Factually we know that mortgage interest rates are at historic lows, which benefits the market.</p>
<p>Typically, the third quarter registers the highest quarterly sales for the year. It is important to note that those sales are generally a reflection of activity from the prior quarter. That activity, as we know it, simply did not occur and will likely have an impact on third quarter sales. There is, however, a very real demand for housing which, even if not reflected in third quarter sales, may be the catalyst to a full recovery of the market.</p>
<p>OneKey™ MLS is one of the largest Realtor subscriber-based multiple listing service in the country, dedicated to servicing more than 41,000 real estate professionals that serve Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.

    <description><![CDATA[ New York is only one of two states that has not released its COVID rental funding assistance to tenants and landlords.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We are four months into the COVID-19 crisis and much of the legislative activity continues to center around COVID issues on both a state and national level, not to mention the myriad of related local rules and regulations.</p>
<p>On the federal level, Congress is beginning to debate a third round of stimulus for the economy. When asked, a number of federal representatives have stated unequivocally that another stimulus package will be passed. Given that this is an election year for many, that is a likely scenario. Although millions of jobs have come back online, the number is nowhere near where job numbers were before the pandemic started.</p>
<p>Some of the ideas being talked about are a traveler tax credit to get people to spend money on a vacation or a getaway somewhere, extending unemployment insurance with the extra $600 a month, which expires this month, and possibly more direct payments to Americans below a certain income. Realtors also support the expansion of the SALT cap. The full reinstatement is needed at this critical time. If another stimulus package passes, it will likely be the final one of the year.</p>
<p>At the state level, some eviction moratoriums could be extended beyond Aug. 20 under a new state law if a region is still under a state of emergency. Landlords can continue to pursue arrears in court, but they cannot evict someone impacted by COVID-19 at this time.</p>
<p>Elections and primary votes have also taken place and hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots must still be counted. Every local board of elections hand counts the ballots so it could take a while especially given that more people this year are voting by mail because of fears of exposure to the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>On a local level, it is important to remember that many states now are on a New York-mandated quarantine list. If potential buyers or sellers are from a state that is on that list and they come to New York, they must quarantine here for two weeks.</p>
<p>This could as always change as the pandemic and the quarantine spreads or shrinks. Stay tuned for updates on these matters.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="attachment_27975" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brian-Levine-headshot-e1557775506902.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27975" class="size-medium wp-image-27975" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brian-Levine-headshot-e1557775506902-250x250.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-27975" class="wp-caption-text">Brian Levine, HGAR In-House Counsel/Director of Legal Services &amp; Professional Standards Administrator</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve made it! We’re out from under the shelter in place orders. Realtors are out in their counties meeting with clients, listing properties, doing showings, putting deals together and everyone is, hopefully, back to work, even if not at 100%.</p>
<p>Since we went underground months ago, many have gotten a little rusty. If you recall, many things were happening prior to and during our sequestering: new rent regulations, along with controversy and litigation, a renewed concern for agency disclosures, fair housing issues, new advertising regulations, new NAR mandates, new local MLS rules and Executive Orders relating to COVID-19 for Realtors. So, in an effort to shake off the rust and hone our skills, I’ve decided that now would be a good time to revisit all these points in one easy-to-read article.</p>
<p><strong>Rent Regulation</strong></p>
<p>A landlord can only retain the aggregate equivalent of one month’s rent. This means that if a landlord charges one month’s rent for security, they cannot retain any more for a pet deposit, etc. This applies to all residential properties (with few exceptions. For example: rent-stabilized or rent-controlled units, retirement communities, adult care facilities, etc.).</p>
<p>A landlord cannot charge an application fee.</p>
<p>Charging for a background/credit check is limited to $20 (or the actual cost, whichever is less). A background/credit check that is provided by a tenant that was conducted within the past 30 days must be accepted by the landlord in lieu of charging a fee for a new check.</p>
<p>As of today, a landlord can require the tenant to pay all commissions in the transaction. This would include paying the listing agent’s commission and the cooperating agent’s commissions. Litigation on this issue is ongoing and the court will hear arguments in September 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Agency Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Licensees are to provide an Agency Disclosure form at the “first substantive contact.” This means that a Realtor must present this form at the first meeting with clients, whether in person, or electronically. This would also include customers/prospective clients at an open house.</p>
<p>The Agency Disclosure form should have both advanced informed consent boxes marked off after full explanation of the possibility of these outcomes occurring.</p>
<p>If dual agency occurs, a new Agency Disclosure form should be executed and signed by the buyer, seller and agent(s).</p>
<p>If the client refuses to sign the form, the Realtor must prepare an affirmation and this must be kept in the broker’s file.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination Form</strong></p>
<p>A Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination Form must be provided at the “first substantive contact” relating to any real estate transaction. This form must be provided to all new clients/customers after June 20, 2020. As a best practice, NYSAR strongly recommends that this form be provided to all clients/customers of the Realtor who had an active relationship with the Realtor prior to June 20th as well.</p>
<p>This form can be provided in person, attached to an e-mail, or by other electronic means with a link to the form, so long as there is language that says the link contains information regarding the New York State Human Rights Law.</p>
<p>If the form is provided in hardcopy or electronically and the recipient is capable of signing the document, it must be signed and returned. If the form is sent via a link along with the language that says the link contains information regarding the New York State Human Rights Law, then that form does not need to be signed. However, a copy of the transmittal should be retained as proof of sending the information.</p>
<p>If the client refuses to sign the form, the Realtor must prepare an affirmation and it must be kept in the broker’s file for a period of not less than three years.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing Notice</strong></p>
<p>A Fair Housing Notice must be displayed at all brick and mortar real estate offices.</p>
<p>If the office has listings or other posting in the windows, the Notice must be placed there as well.</p>
<p>If the office does not have listings in the windows, or the office is not accessible to sidewalk traffic, the Notice must be displayed in the same location as the Broker’s license.</p>
<p>The Notice must be displayed at all open houses.</p>
<p>While a licensee is not required to present a copy of the Notice to persons, if one is requested, it should be provided.</p>
<p>A link to the Fair Housing Notice must be placed on the homepage of every licensee’s websites. This notice must be prominently and conspicuously displayed. NYSAR has interpreted this to mean, “above the fold;” meaning that a person should not have to scroll down the page to get to the link.</p>
<p>NYSAR has indicated that if the link cannot be placed on the homepage, then the link should be placed on the post itself. Further, NYSAR has stated that if, after good faith efforts, it is not possible to place the link in either location, then a link back to the agent’s website, which contains the Notice’s link, may be sufficient. The key is that the licensee will have to show the inability to place the link on the medium in question.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising Regulations</strong></p>
<p>New advertising regulations will take effect on November 2, 2020.  NYSAR is recommending that licensees begin implementation immediately. They require brokers and associated licensees that advertise an exclusive listing of another broker to clearly and conspicuously display the name of the listing broker and it would be preceded by one of seven permitted phrases.</p>
<p>This applies to an IDX feed on their website as well as paid advertisements through third parties.</p>
<p>The new regulations also require licensees that pay a third party to place their advertisement that, when displaying another broker’s exclusive listing, it must have words to disclose that it is a paid advertisement, including the word “advertisement” immediately following the name of the licensee.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>If a licensee has an exclusive listing agreement with a homeowner/landlord and they advertise that listing to the public, the listing must be placed on the MLS within 1 business day or face fines. This includes office exclusives that are marketed to anyone other than the brokerage’s clients.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitators</strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, if a Realtor is unable to present an offer or obtain access to a property, they can obtain the assistance of a Facilitator. Failure to respond or work with the Facilitator can result in the levying of fines to the listing broker.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Rules from COVID-19 Executive Orders</strong></p>
<p>All activities should still be done remotely, if possible.</p>
<p>Masks must be worn and a distance of six feet must be maintained.</p>
<p>Inspections/appraisals/walkthroughs may be accompanied, so long as masks/social distancing is observed.</p>
<p>Accompanied showings may only be done in-person if the property is unoccupied.</p>
<p>Properties must be wiped down before and after all visits.</p>
<p>Only one “party” is allowed in a property at a time.</p>
<p>There are many other “best practices,” so please <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/legal-advocacy/barristers-briefing-phase-2-what-you-need-to-know/">see my article from last month for their review</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—After enduring months of setbacks brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, a new survey from the National Association of Realtors released on Thursday, July 9 shows that more than nine in 10 of its members believe they are in the process of recovering as many states start to reopen their economies.</p>
<p>NAR&#8217;s 2020 Market Recovery Survey polled agents about their respective residential and commercial real estate markets, finding that 92% of respondents stated that a portion of their buyers have either returned to or never left the market. Among those members, 18% reported that their buyers never left the market at all, and 9% said that all of their buyers have already returned to the market. Small towns and rural areas were more likely to report that there had been no pause in buyer activity and were also more likely to report a stronger return of buyers to the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The residential market has seen a swift rebound of activity as numerous states have begun to ease mandatory stay-at-home orders,&#8221; said Lawrence Yun, NAR&#8217;s chief economist. &#8220;Many potential buyers and home sellers were kept at bay in the initial stages of the coronavirus outbreak, but Realtors nationwide were able to quickly pivot, embracing technology and business practices to ensure the home buying process continued in a safe manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of seller activity, 89% of Realtors said a share of their clients have either returned to the market or never delisted their property. Roughly one quarter of respondents, or 24%, indicated that their sellers never left the market. Suburban and urban markets are more likely to have reported fewer sellers returning to the market compared to small and rural markets.</p>
<p>While the housing market as a whole was understandably caught off-guard by the pandemic, the NAR survey found that many members are now prepared should another surge of the coronavirus occur. Thirty-nine percent of those polled said they are at least somewhat prepared for a second wave of the disease, with 19% reporting they are &#8220;very prepared.&#8221; Moreover, of those who believe there might be a resurgence, 30% said they are more prepared now, as they know what to expect. Twenty-seven percent indicated they are concerned enough that they have changed their business practices in some form in order to be prepared for another bout of the virus.</p>
<p>Of those who are currently working with buyers, 54% said their buyers&#8217; timelines to find and purchase a home has remained the same, while 27% report that their clients now express more urgency about buying a home.</p>
<p>Among NAR membership currently working with sellers, two-thirds said their sellers&#8217; timelines to sell has remained the same. Twenty-three percent reported sellers who feel more urgency to sell their property. Less urgency was cited more frequently in urban areas and in suburban areas or small towns and rural markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of potential buyers noted stalled plans due to the pandemic and that has led to more urgency and a pent-up demand to buy,&#8221; said Yun. &#8220;After being home for months on end—in a home they already wanted to leave—buyers are reminded how much their current home may lack certain desired features or amenities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some cases, respondents reported changes in their buyers&#8217; preferences. Twenty-four percent of Realtors indicated having buyers who shifted the location of where they intend to buy a house due to the coronavirus. Among those who noted having buyers change their intended location, 47% stated that their buyers prefer to purchase housing in the suburbs, 39% cited rural areas and 25% cited smaller town markets.</p>
<p>Thirty-five percent of NAR members surveyed said buyers have modified at least one home feature that is important to them because of the coronavirus outbreak. The most common home features cited as increasingly important are home offices, spaces to accommodate family members new to the residence—older adult relatives, newborns or new pets—larger homes with more personal space and bigger yards that would allow for growing foods.</p>
<p>Also, in response to the pandemic, 13% said that homebuyers changed their home type of choice from multi-family to single family. This shift is highest in urban markets at 16%. Thirty-three percent answered that buyers have adjusted commuting needs since the pandemic began, with 22% less concerned with their commute and 7% wanting to live close to bike trails that connect them to work. Just 5% responded they now have a greater concern about parking and more concern for a location that affords the ability to drive to work.</p>
<p>On the commercial real estate front, some members indicated they are contending with hardships, as only 19% of property managers said they have been receiving all rent payments on time, and only 36% of individual landlords have received timely payments.</p>
<p>Seventy-four percent have reported that leases have been terminated or said tenants have needed to delay rent payments, with the greatest shares (56%) happening in non-essential retail establishments, followed by the office sector at 38%. However, grocery stores are faring well, the least cited of the commercial properties at 4%.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers have been forced to move away from buying in stores and are now doing much more shopping from home,&#8221; said Yun. &#8220;Unfortunately, this has come at the detriment of commercial property owners, but these circumstances could be an opportunity for growth in the industrial warehouse market, as Americans have become more reliant on home delivery services.&#8221;</p>
<p>As economies reopen, 44% of NAR members say they expect the demand for industrial properties to increase, and 35% expect the demand for multi-family properties to increase. In comparison, 72% expect the demand for non-essential retail to decline and 66% said they expect office usage to decrease.</p>
<p>The biggest concern for small businesses, according to 83% of commercial members, is a lack of profitability due to a decrease in customers. A majority of Realtors also expressed concern with the following: a resurgence of the outbreak forcing another shutdown (66%), protecting the health of employees, (61%) and challenges with implementing social-distancing measures (59%).</p>

<p>On April 2, in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the New York State Court of Appeals issued a decision in <em>Regina Metropolitan Co., LLC v. New York State Division of Housing and Community Preservation (</em>“Regina Metropolitan”) [see<a href="https://bit.ly/38I4y79]"> https://bit.ly/38I4y79]</a> barring the retroactive application of certain provisions of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (the “2019 Tenant Protection Act” or “2019 Act”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3e9zHkQ">https://bit.ly/3e9zHkQ</a>]. The decision did not receive much attention, but it is certainly an important one that could ultimately provide a basis for a challenge regarding the constitutionality of parts of the 2019 Tenant Protection Act.</p>
<p>It has been just over a year since the 2019 Tenant Protection Act was signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. From a landlord’s perspective, it has been met with anger and confusion. Many lawsuits challenging the new law soon followed. Regina Metropolitan is one of the first decisions, which actually involves multiple lawsuits that were consolidated, issued by highest court in New York, and in a lengthy decision, the court was sharply split, 4 to 3.</p>
<p><strong>Certain Highlights of the 2019 Act</strong></p>
<p>The 2019 Act was the subject of Legal Corner articles in July, 2019 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3iCfms2">https://bit.ly/3iCfms2</a>] and August, 2019 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3fau9Ie">https://bit.ly/3fau9Ie</a>]. It changed the entire landlord-tenant landscape overnight. While the 2019 Act was passed to protect tenants, it has forced landlords to make critical, and often detrimental, decisions relating to the operation of their rental properties, often having the opposite effect. Many landlords and landlord groups have commenced lawsuits to have the act invalidated.</p>
<p>Under the 2019 Act, the New York Rent Regulation laws were extended in perpetuity. The rent regulation laws were passed many years ago to address housing shortages that existed immediately following World War II. In 1974, New York State also passed the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA) to address housing shortages and issues that existed at the time. In New York City, the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (RSL) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3iCns3U">https://bit.ly/3iCns3U</a>] was also enacted to afford tenants similar protections. However, none of the previous laws were passed in perpetuity, and in fact, they were passed with the requirement there be a periodic reassessment of whether these rent regulation laws were still necessary. The ETPA was set to expire on June 15, 2019, and was extended for good with the passage of the 2019 Act.</p>
<p>The 2019 Act’s main focus was to make affordable housing available to all who needed such housing and could not afford it. However, two major changes introduced by the 2019 Act are the repeal of the “High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation” and the “High-Income Deregulation.” Previously, the law allowed apartments to become completely decontrolled upon vacancy if the rent for a particular apartment reached certain levels set by the Rent Guidelines Board. The 2019 Act also repealed provisions, which allowed for decontrol based on income levels (i.e., where tenants earn more than $200,000 per year for more than two years). These changes now keep apartments under rent control indefinitely, significantly limiting a landlord’s ability to operate the properties at a profit, while benefitting those tenants who are able to pay higher rents. These changes directly conflict with the original intent of the rental laws, to make housing available to those who cannot afford it.</p>
<p><strong>Claims Made by Tenants in Regina Metropolitan</strong></p>
<p>In Regina Metropolitan, the Court of Appeals pointed out that while appeals were pending, the 2019 Act was enacted amending “…the statute of limitations, alter[ing] the method for determining legal regulated rent for overcharge purposes and substantially expand[ing] the nature and scope of owner liability in rent overcharge cases.” The tenants urged the Court of Appeals to apply the new overcharge calculation provisions to their cases, which were pending at the time of the 2019 Act’s enactment. The court pointed out that some tenants were “seek[ing] recovery of overcharges incurred more than a decade before the new legislation.” The tenants argued the amendments effectuated by the 2019 Act should be applied to these appeals based on language in the 2019 Act, which provides that Part F “…shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any claims pending or filed on and after such date.”</p>
<p><strong>Part F of the 2019 Act</strong></p>
<p>The court focuses on the major changes effectuated under Part F of the 2019 Act and points out that “Part F extended the four-year limitations period for overcharge claims to six years, provided that an overcharge complaint ‘may be filed…at any time’ and eliminated the provision —present, in substance, since 1983—stating that ‘no determination of an overcharge and no award or calculation of an award of the amount of an overcharge may be based upon an overcharge having occurred more than four years before the complaint is filed’.”</p>
<p>The court further explained that Part F completely removed the previous lookback rule, and now requires the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) and courts to ‘“…consider all available rent history which is reasonably necessary’ to investigate overcharge claims and determine legal regulated rent, regardless of the vintage of that history and including records kept by owners, tenants and agencies.” And, while Part F increased the four-year record retention period to six years, it provides that where a landlord does not keep records beyond the six-year period, the courts and DHCR can still review the entire rental history of the unit (which could predate the six-year period by many years, even decades). The 2019 Act also increased the period of time for which treble damages could be sought for willful overcharges by landlords from two to six years.</p>
<p><strong>Court of Appeals Decision in Favor of the Landlords</strong></p>
<p>The landlords, however, the court points out, “argue[d] that the effective date language does not evince a clear legislative intent to apply the new overcharge calculation provisions retroactively, particularly to cases no longer pending in DHCR or the trial court and further contend, in any event, that retroactive application of the new overcharge calculation methodology to these appeals would violate due process protections in the State and Federal Constitutions.” The court pointed out that this change in the law has a “…destabilizing effect [and] is especially severe.”</p>
<p>It determined that the provisions of the 2019 Act could only be applied prospectively and not retroactively, nor to pending cases. The Court of Appeals highlighted the drastic and unfair effect that the retroactive application of the new law to pending claims would have on the landlord. It explained that “…under the former rule” the overcharge calculation for one of the tenants totaled $10,271.40. However, applying the new rule, the DHCR came up with damages of $285,390.39.</p>
<p>The court further stated, “Critically for purposes of calculating the amount owed for any overcharge, Part F now renders reviewable rent increases that were shielded by the prior lookback rule, permitting reconstruction of the legal-regulated rent based on any relevant records in the apartment&#8217;s entire rental history. Although the tenant can directly recover only for overcharges occurring during the six years preceding the complaint, the damages calculations for those years may now effectively incorporate conduct—illegal increases—preceding that period and occurring at any point in the rental history.” The court was also critical of the permissibility of the courts and DHCR to use an entire unit’s rental history when the record-keeping requirement of the landlord was only for a finite period of time (i.e., previously four years, but extended to six years under the new law).</p>
<p><strong>Potential Constitutional Concerns Beyond The Retroactive Effect of the 2019 Act</strong></p>
<p>In its decision, the Court of Appeals referenced various issues relating to the deliberative process utilized by the legislature in passing the 2019 Act and general principles of fairness and constitutionality. While the decision mainly focused on the “retroactive” application of the 2019 Act to pending claims, it did point out on several occasions that the legislature, in passing the new rental laws, and particularly Part F, did not provide any legislative intent or justification for passing this “retroactive” section of the law. The court, more importantly, also made reference to general constitutional concerns that could potentially be utilized in other cases brought by landlords to invalidate additional parts of the 2019 Act.</p>
<p>The court sternly stated that “…there is no indication here that the legislature considered the harsh and destabilizing effect on owners&#8217; settled expectations, much less had a rational justification for that result.” It goes on to point out that “While prospective application of Part F to overcharges occurring after the effective date may serve legitimate and laudable policy goals, no explanation has been offered, much less a rational one, for retroactive application of the amendments to increase or create liability for rent overcharges that occurred years—even decades—in the past.” The Court of Appeals made clear what its role is and explains that “[i]n this regard, the rational basis test — although extremely deferential — must be meaningfully applied to ensure basic principles of fairness and substantial justice, lest we abdicate our responsibility to the citizens of this state.”</p>
<p>The court further points out that the passage of such a basically unfair provision of the law “…impairs real property rights by diminishing or possibly eliminating the constitutionally protected return on investment owners realized in the past related to the use of their properties.” The court’s reference here could be useful in future constitutional challenges to the 2019 Act.</p>
<p>The court highlighted due process concerns and explained that “…an unfair retroactive assessment of liability upsets settled expectations, and it thereby undermines a basic objective of law itself. To find that the Due Process Clause protects against this kind of fundamental unfairness—that it protects against an unfair allocation of public burdens through this kind of specially arbitrary retroactive means—is to read the clause in light of a basic purpose: the fair application of law, which purpose hearkens back to the Magna Carta.” The court explains that our system of “checks and balances” is critical and that “It is the responsibility of the judiciary to safeguard the rights afforded under our State [and Federal] Constitution[s].” While the court states that its ruling is narrow, the decision does seem to lay the groundwork for future challenges to the 2019 Act; only time will tell.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Stymied by COVID-19 from on-site volunteer events since mid-March, the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation (HGRF) is carefully resuming volunteering with local charities and non-profit organizations throughout the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>On July 28, Realtor volunteers will join an outdoor event, sponsored by the Westchester County Parks Foundation, to clean up Twin Lakes Park in Eastchester. Volunteers will be on land and in canoes, assisting in hand-pulling water chestnuts, which are invasive aquatic plants found in the lake and on its shores. Ridding the area of these plants will help to ensure the environmental health of the lake.</p>
<p>While this is an outdoor event, participants will be required to wear masks and maintain social distancing practices while working.</p>
<p>The Westchester Parks Foundation often engages the public to advocate for and invest in the preservation, conservation, use, and enjoyment of the 18,000 acres of parks, trails, and open spaces within the Westchester County Parks system</p>
<p>“We are cautiously optimistic about re-starting our volunteer events on behalf of the HG Realtor Foundation,” said Gail Fattizzi, HGAR President and HGRF Program Committee Chair. “We have contacted many of the non-profits that the Foundation has issued grant money to, to see if they are open to receiving volunteers at this time, and setting up events if they are.”</p>
<p>On August 14, HGAR Realtor volunteers will be back at the Food Bank of the Hudson Valley in Cornwall-on-Hudson, helping to sort and pack grocery items for needy families. This follows the Realtor Foundation’s mid-May event at the Food Bank, which was its first post-COVID volunteer event.</p>
<p>While the food packing takes place indoors, the volunteer groups are smaller than normal, allowing people ample room to navigate the facility. Masks are also required.</p>
<p>The Food Bank of the Hudson Valley is a branch of the Regional Food Bank of Northeastern New York and a member of Feeding America, the national food bank network. Last year, the Hudson Valley branch provided more than 15 million pounds of food to 400-member agencies in Orange, Ulster, Dutchess, Rockland, Sullivan and Putnam counties.</p>
<p>The agency also offers other programs such as the BackPack Program. This helps alleviate child hunger by discreetly providing hungry children with backpacks full of nutritious and easy-to-prepare food on Friday afternoons, so they have food to eat throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>“In addition to the upcoming events we already have confirmed, we&#8217;ll be planning something for NYS Realtor Cares Week (August 16th &#8211; 22nd), and other events in the fall, conditions allowing,” added Fattizzi. “Events will follow all recommended health and safety guidelines such as masks and social distancing.&#8221;</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Second quarter home sales, according to a recently released report by OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC, were down anywhere from 39.8% in the Bronx; 27.9% and 27.4% in Orange and Westchester counties, to 6.2% lower in Putnam County, as compared to the second quarter of last year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The second quarter home sales market in the Hudson Valley, dominated by restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in New York State, struggled mightily with sales activity down significantly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OneKey-MLS-2nd-Qtr-2020-Real-Estate-Market-Report-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second quarter home sales, according to a recently released report by OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC</a>, were down anywhere from 39.8% in the Bronx; 27.9% and 27.4% in Orange and Westchester counties, to 6.2% lower in Putnam County, as compared to the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>While the sales figures speak to the deep impacts COVID-19 have wrought on the region’s economy, brokerage executives credit the ingenuity, savviness and determination of agents to complete transactions during the lockdown in spite of restrictions imposed during Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s “New York on Pause” process. Agents were forced to conduct business online and show homes virtually. New York State permitted notary services online and attorneys conducted business in parking lots, in tents and between cars. The sales figures could have been much worse had it not been for the agents’ perseverance under trying and sometimes frustrating business conditions.</p>
<p>Although sales figures in the second quarter took a significant hit, real estate brokerage executives believe that since the home sales market entered the COVID-19 crisis on a strong note with plentiful demand, the industry could see a fairly rapid recovery if a second wave of the pandemic is prevented.</p>
<p>On March 7th, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency and as of March 20th all non-essential businesses were closed. Most of the COVID- restrictions on real estate were lifted when the Mid-Hudson region entered phase three of the four-phased reopening process on June 23. The Mid-Hudson entered phase four on July 7.</p>
<p>According to the 2020 Second Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan Counties, New York released on July 7, single-family residential sales, as compared to Q2-2019 in Putnam County were down 6.6%; Sullivan County posted 10.6% lower single-family home sales, while Westchester County’s single-family sector sales plunged 21.3%. Rounding out the painful figures, single-family homes in Rockland County fell 22.1% and Orange County single-family sales dropped 26.5% in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>While sales were down, the median sale price of single-family homes throughout the region, with the exception of Putnam County, were higher in the second quarter as compared to 12 months earlier. Sales prices increased 17.7% in Sullivan to $175,000; 6.7% in Rockland to $480,000; 12.5% in Orange to $298,000 and 1.2% in Westchester to $711,000. Putnam County registered a slight decrease of 1.1% in its median price. The median price in Putnam was $359,900 at the end of the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $365,000 one year ago.</p>
<p>The lower-priced condominium and cooperative markets were battered, suffering a 41.5% and 30.4% decline in sales in Westchester County in the second quarter. The median price of a condominium in the second quarter in Westchester County fell 2.3% to $391,000, while the median for a co op in the county rose 5.6% to $190,000.<strong> Editor’s Note:</strong> <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/web-exclusive/hudson-valley-home-sales-take-hit-from-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the full OneKey™ MLS report and charts</a></p>
<p>HGAR President Gail Fattizzi said the market entered the pandemic on a strong note. Sales began to stall in March and hit their low mark in April, but enjoyed a quick turnaround in May once restrictions began to be lifted.</p>
<p>She points to a number of positive prevailing trends that could foster a recovery in coming months, including: strong buyer demand, a weak New York City market that includes some residents considering a move to the suburbs, as well as the quick rebound of the stock market.</p>
<p>Fattizzi, who is executive director of independent real estate brokerage network Westchester Real Estate Inc. of Somers, said looking forward, “The Westchester and Putnam markets will continue to be strong into the fall. Buyers should get their ducks in a row and be ready to come in with strong offers. They should also consider the fixer-uppers that others don’t want to tackle.”</p>
<p>She recommends, “Buy now, without all the competition, lock in a super low interest rate for 30 years on a renovation loan so the work is all financed, and create the house of your dreams. Sellers should prep their homes and get them on the market now…but keep pricing realistic—buyers are educated and understand value. Know that procedures for showings are still not ‘back to normal,’ that safety is still paramount, but the outcome is definitely worth the effort.”</p>
<p>Leah Caro, chairperson of OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC, also praised agents during the lockdown for their ingenuity. During an interview on the radio program “Building Knowledge” presented by the Building and Realty Institute on WVOX, she said that sales along all market types should rise now that most COVID restrictions have been lifted and the industry has returned to a more normal sales environment.</p>
<p>She believes that one sector that should benefit from New York City residents considering a move to the suburbs is the cooperative market.</p>
<p>“Rents in the city are sky-high, Caro, who is President and Principal Broker of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville, said. “Owning real estate is always cheaper than renting and a co-op is a great way to get your foot in the door for housing in Westchester.”</p>
<p>Caro also noted that very low mortgage interest rates should also fuel home sales in the region going forward. In addition, the expected increase in work-at-home policies, could spark additional activity in locations outside of Westchester’s cities.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence in its second quarter report authored by Chairman Stephen Meyers and Liz Nunan, president and CEO, noted that agents had to adjust to the new normal during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“All parties involved in a real estate transaction scrambled to meet the demand, all while working virtually, within the guidelines issued by the state. Shortly thereafter came a huge wave of inquiries for short-term furnished rentals to start, soon morphing into single-family home inquiries with an emphasis on home offices and outdoor amenities. As the shutdown wore on, more and more of the workforce embraced working from home as a sustainable model, even if only for part of the time,” they stated.</p>
<p>They added that during the lockdown, many homeowners chose not to sell and opted to sit tight, not wanting to expose themselves to any possible health risks.” Residents in our area did not have the same urgency to flee that the residents of New York City did, in fact, quite the opposite. Thus, throughout Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties, inventory was down,” the report stated.</p>
<p>Meyers and Nunan concluded, “Second quarter data for 2020 is partly the result of an atypical event, a paradigm shift in the wants and needs of the buyers. But the market at the end of the quarter remains strong, and interest rates continue to drive the market forward. It remains to be seen if these trends continue long into the year.”</p>
<p>In terms of the region’s luxury market, Houlihan Lawrence indicates that inventory levels are low and pending sales are increasing in many markets. The lower end of the luxury market is gaining the most strength and buyers remain value driven, the brokerage firm’s second quarter report on the luxury market states.</p>
<p>“For now, it appears that the 2020 spring market, which coincided with the start of the shutdown, had a late start. Is this a moment in real estate, or a structural shift with long lasting implications? It is too soon to tell. Meaningful insights will be gleaned from third quarter closed sales data, reflecting much of the activity that began in earnest in May when the curve flattened,” said Anthony P. Cutugno, senior vice president, Houlihan Lawrence Private Brokerage.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, managing principal and chief creative officer of Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty, also offered high praise for agents and noted that any exodus by New York City residents to the suburbs will be just a short-term trend.</p>
<p>“My basic feeling is that it could have been a lot worse,” Rand said. “I really was surprised how robust the market was during the pandemic and we were able to sell homes at all.” He noted that at the onset of the coronavirus restrictions in March, the brokerage firm expected sales to be down 50% to 60%, instead of the approximately 25% sales decline in sales the region recorded in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Going forward and with the proviso that a second wave of COVID-19 does not hit the New York market, Rand believes that while closed sales in June and July will be lower than last year, activity will be strong and opens (new contracts) in June and July will be higher.</p>
<p>Rand noted that inventory levels region-wide remain very low and combined with strong demand, market conditions will be tight.</p>
<p>“I believe the sales rate in the third quarter will be much higher than the sales rate in the second quarter and the average sales rate for the past year,” Rand said. “I think we are going to have a huge closing rate of deals. Closings will be way up over the next few months.”</p>
<p>He added that current market conditions will result in agents having to deal with multiple offers and bidding wars on some listings going forward.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—National Association of Realtors Fair Housing Policy Director Bryan Greene said the current racial equality and COVID pandemic crises remind him of the classic motion picture— “Jaws” where actor Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody upon seeing the killer great white shark for the first time, says, “You’re Gonna Need a Bigger Boat.”</p>
<p>Greene, the guest speaker at HGAR’s Fair Housing Summit held on Zoom on July 15, said that “Jaws” and sequel “Jaws II” chronicled a beach town’s dilemma balancing economics with safety, similar to what many communities, counties and states are currently dealing with in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“It is a great metaphor for some of the issues that we are dealing with,” Greene said during the Zoom summit. “It means that the tools that we have for the job may not be sufficient… to deal with the challenges at hand.”</p>
<p>HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty noted that the association intended to hold its Fair Housing Summit in April, but the coronavirus pandemic forced its rescheduling and change of format to virtual. In addition, the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police has prompted nationwide protests under the banner of “Black Lives Matter.”</p>
<p>The confluence of the pandemic and the ongoing discussions now taking place concerning racial inequality “has taken on a new urgency,” Haggerty said. “I try to find a lot of silver linings in what we have gone through over the last three months. If there is a silver lining it is that it has started a dialogue that should have been ongoing for many, many decades,” he added.</p>
<p>The Fair Housing Committee chaired by Carmen Baumen and HGAR’s Fair Housing Task Force agreed that an event featuring NAR’s Director of Fair Housing Policy was in order in light of the issues raised in a <em>Newsday</em> article published in November 2019.</p>
<p>Greene related that the <a href="https://projects.newsday.com/long-island/real-estate-agents-investigation/">Newsday article</a> detailing alleged fair housing violations and other discriminatory practices on Long Island pre-dated the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others at the hands of police. While the Newsday investigation has brought Fair Housing keenly into focus in New York State and across the nation, the killings of Floyd, Taylor and others have also brought racial inequality and systemic racism in the United States front and center, as well.</p>
<p>In fact, the<em> Newsday</em> article hit the newsstands just three weeks after Greene joined NAR. He said the article convinced him that not only was further Fair Housing training necessary, but also “a culture change and accountability” were in order. A few months later, the coronavirus pandemic began and while it has impacted everyone in the United States, Greene noted that it has had a disproportionate impact on the minority populations.”</p>
<p>He related that Fair Housing laws have been in effect for 50 years, and while Realtors receive Fair Housing training and should “understand the rules of the road, something like <em>Newsday</em> emerges and we discover we have a big problem still. Whatever we have been doing hasn’t been sufficient to address it. So, ‘We Need a Bigger Boat.’”</p>
<p>The ongoing discussions centering on the police killings and COVID-19 have brought housing into focus and the continuing problem of segregation. Greene noted that some housing advocates have stated that “as Americans, based on race, national origin, we live apart.” Greene later said that many metropolitan areas in the United States remain as segregated as they were 90 years ago.</p>
<p>During the webinar, Greene detailed a host of initiatives being undertaken by NAR to ensure Fair Housing regulations are adhered to by its members.</p>
<p>Back in January, the leadership of the National Association of Realtors unanimously passed a Fair Housing Action Plan which it said would distinguish NAR as a national industry leader on fair housing.</p>
<p>NAR re-organized in the summer of 2019 to create a new Fair Housing Policy Committee so NAR could more effectively advocate on national fair housing policy. NAR later hired Greene as its Director of Fair Housing Policy. He previously served at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for 29 years, where he was the top career official overseeing enforcement of the federal Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p>NAR stated the <em>Newsday</em> investigation underscored the need for NAR to further ramp up and reinvigorate its fair housing commitment.</p>
<p>NAR’s new Fair Housing Action Plan, abbreviated ‘ACT,’ emphasizes (A)ccountability, (C)ulture Change, and (T)raining in order to ensure America’s 1.4 million Realtors are doing everything possible to protect housing rights in America. Among other things, the plan specifically commits NAR to:</p>
<p>• Work closely with State Association Executives to ensure that state licensing laws include effective fair-housing training requirements and hold real estate agents accountable to their fair housing obligations;</p>
<p>• Launch a Public-Service Announcement Campaign that reaffirm NAR’s commitment to fair housing, and how consumers can report problems;</p>
<p>• Integrate fair housing into all Realtor conferences and engagements;</p>
<p>• Explore the creation of a voluntary self-testing program, in partnership with a fair housing organization, as a resource for brokers and others who want confidential reports on agent practices so they can address problems;</p>
<p>• Create more robust fair housing education, including unconscious-bias training, and education on how the actions of Realtors shape communities.</p>
<p>• Conduct a national study to determine what factors motivate discrimination in sales market</p>
<p>• Profile leaders who exemplify the best fair housing practices and workplace diversity</p>
<p>• Develop materials to help Realtors provide consumers with information on schools that avoids fair housing pitfalls.</p>
<p>The sponsors of the HGAR Fair Housing Summit were: Dolgetta Law, PLLC; Fairway Independent Mortgage Corp.; Judicial Title Insurance Agency, LLC; Family First Funding, LLC; Mark’s Inspections; Stone Home Inspections, LLC and Quintessential Mortgage Group.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Haggerty during the webinar noted a number of changes/initiatives the association have undertaken in terms of Fair Housing.</p>
<p>He noted that HGAR has completely revamped its “Fair Housing Took Kit” that is located on the association’s website at hgar.com. The changes were spearheaded by HGAR’s Fair Housing Committee chaired by Baumen and HGAR’s Director of Member Engagement Jana Currier. Among the Fair Housing tools on the HGAR website include a very informative NAR video entitled:<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/videos/bias-override-overcoming-barriers-to-fair-housing"> “Bias Override: Overcoming Barriers to Fair Housing.”</a></p>
<p>HGAR has also partnered with the Business Council of Westchester on a series of Anti-Racism webinars. The first webinar entitled “Unconscious Bias” was very well received. The second webinar was held this morning (July 16) and featured James Francis of Balancing Life’s Issues, who discussed: “Fostering Inclusion in the Workplace.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>While most economic news of late in this time of the coronavirus is usually described as “bleak” or “grim,” an international site selector speaking to a virtual meeting of the Orange County Partnership on July 22 indicated that the county’s prime location, available workforce and lower cost of land and housing will attract investment, particularly as residents and businesses abandon urban markets for the suburbs.</p>
<p>As part of its recently launched multi-faceted marketing effort, the Orange County Partnership hosted international site selector Didi Caldwell, president and founding principal of Global Location Strategies, on its virtual Investor Breakfast webinar to discuss industry trends as many areas of the United States continue to battle the coronavirus and what she believes locations can do to be ready once the pandemic has been arrested.</p>
<p>Caldwell noted that the economy’s fundamentals were strong heading into the pandemic, making this period of time different than the circumstances prior to the Great Recession in 2008.</p>
<p>While she said that her firm is very busy with corporate space requirements, Caldwell described the overall view of the real estate investment market as a “mixed bag.”</p>
<p>However, in terms of Orange County, she was much more upbeat. Caldwell, whose Greenville, SC-based firm is a member of the Site Selectors Guild, pointed to a recently released survey by the Guild that clearly indicates the suburbs are far from dead.</p>
<p>Released on July 16, the survey of Guild members conducted the week of June 29 found that the pandemic has brought suburban areas and mid-size cities into the forefront of consideration for future site selection projects and even put rural areas well ahead of large urban areas. When Guild members were asked about locations that are “likely” or “very likely” to be considered by corporations looking to expand, relocate or open new facilities in the next 12 months, 64% chose suburban areas, 57% chose mid-size cities, 31% chose rural areas and just 10% chose large urban areas.</p>
<p>Of the consultants who agreed that large urban centers are “not at all” or “unlikely” to be considered for future projects, 100% said that New York City would be among the least likely locations to be considered for future projects in the next 12 months. Los Angeles and Chicago followed with 63% and 42%, respectively. The survey was conducted the week of June 29 in partnership with Development Counsellors International.</p>
<p>“This (COVID-19) shock has started to have folks value living in a suburb or a smaller community where they can have a little more breathing room; where they don’t have to commute and given the position of where Orange County is, I think that really bodes well for the interest of not just residents, but also of companies that want to take advantage of the talent that is going to be moving to places like Orange County,” Caldwell predicted.</p>
<p>The Guild’s predicted top five most active industries for growth also served as good news for Orange County business since the number two and number three industries (Advanced Manufacturing and Food and Beverage Processing) are core strengths for the county.</p>
<p><strong>Biotech and Life Sciences – 67% (down from 68% in April)</strong><br />
<strong> Advanced Manufacturing – 51% (up from 29% in April)</strong><br />
<strong> Food and Beverage Processing – 47% (up from 16% in April)</strong><br />
<strong> Transportation and Logistics – 44% (down from 48% in April)</strong><br />
<strong> Software and IT – 31% (up from 19% in April)</strong></p>
<p>“One of the things that I think is very important for Orange County is in the Advanced Manufacturing and Food and Beverage Processing (sectors),” Caldwell said. “Those are unique opportunities for you as companies start to realign their supply chains and particularly with your access to such a large population base. I think that will be a big opportunity.”</p>
<p>Caldwell also pointed to another finding from the Site Selectors Guild survey that offers hope for an economic recovery on the horizon. Consultants reported an uptick in projects moving forward in June compared to April, with 61% of Guild members reporting that companies are moving forward with site selection projects, a 16% increase since April. Of Guild members surveyed, 34% said that companies are pausing site selection projects, and 5% reported companies are consolidating facilities or canceling site selection projects.</p>
<p>In closing, while Caldwell offered a simple mantra of “Keep calm and embrace the chaos,” she pointed to a host of positive demographic data that makes Orange County attractive to business.</p>
<p>“I see that Orange County has a really good combination of both access to dense population, but also some wide open spaces where manufacturers can feel more secure that they are not going to have a negative impact on residences,” she said. Caldwell did offer one negative—high electric rates.</p>
<p>She concluded, “So, if I am looking at where Orange County can compete, you have an excellent workforce pipeline that has some very good skills; you have access to a large city and you have some existing clusters you can build on. And if I were you, I would be looking at projects that are more capital intensive, that are high-paying and use a smaller footprint than some of the mega projects and a lower energy usage.”</p>
<p>Global Location Strategies is one of the world’s most experienced and reputable site selection firms specializing in intensive manufacturing and industrial facilities. GLS has conducted site searches in more than 50 countries for companies with particular concentration in pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing, chemical/petrochemicals, metals/polymers/composites, paper and automotive. The company offers a full suite of site selection services, including location strategy, site selection, due diligence, and incentives negotiation. Economic development services include site readiness studies, industrial site identification and workforce analysis.</p>
<p>Prior to Caldwell’s presentation, Michael Gilfeather, president of Orange County Bank &amp; Trust Co. and chairman of the Board of Directors of the Orange County Partnership related that business activity is increasing and the county and the Partnership must be prepared for change.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus said that he was pleased with the pipeline of businesses looking to invest in Orange County and noted that the county is seeking increased interest from residents and businesses looking to escape New York City for the suburbs. He reported that the annual New York Air Show will be held in Orange County again this year, but the venue will be changed from New York Stewart International Airport in New Windsor to the Orange County Airport in Montgomery. He also touted the Request for Proposals that have been sent out by the county on the Camp LaGuardia property in Chester and Blooming Grove and three county-owned properties in the City of Newburgh.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president and chief executive officer of the Orange County Partnership, reported that there are currently 55 active leads for firms interested in investing or relocating to Orange County, including 25 manufacturing firms, 11 distribution companies and two firms engaged in Agritourism. She added that there are also another 15 pending possible corporate expansions in the county and noted that despite the pandemic, 2020 could be one of the Partnership’s busiest years.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Legislative activity remains high on the national level. As the incidences of Covid-19 escalate in many areas of the country, Congress is in talks to pass another aid package which, at this point, is far from what either party can agree upon.</p>
<p>One of the components of the bill that is being discussed is extending the unemployment boost of $600 per week. At this point, the Senate version call for a reduction to $200 per week while the Democratic controlled House feels it should remain at the $600 level. Also, under discussion is extending the pandemic unemployment assistance to independent contractors which has been a lifeline for those out of work who normally would not qualify for the PUA assistance.</p>
<p>Another component under discussion is aid for state and local governments. The House has included that in the bill that they passed, while the Senate is opposed, contending that state and local governments should not be bailed out, and should have managed their finances more prudently during the good times so that they would now have more cash on hand. It will be devastating for New York if aid is not given to state and local governments. Local and state taxes will likely rise and services will be cut. This is what occurred during the last big recession in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>Finally, the last item being discussed is extending eviction moratoriums at the federal level. Many people are late on their rent through no fault of their own. One way to mitigate this would be to get direct aid to renters and mortgage servicers so both remain solvent through this crisis.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates on this legislative package.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the National Governors Association are pressing Congress to include billions of dollars in financial assistance to state governments as part of the next COVID-19 aid package currently being debated in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo in a letter to the New York Congressional delegation said that New York State is facing a $30-billion deficit over the next two fiscal years ($14 billion in the current fiscal year and $16 billon in the 2022 fiscal year), while the MTA is expected to encounter a $12-billion shortfall and the Port Authority can expect a $3-billion budget gap.</p>
<p>Cuomo praised the House-passed HEROES Act, which includes repeal of the SALT tax. However, he was highly critical of the GOP-backed HEALS Act plan, which does not include assistance to state governments.</p>
<p>“I applaud the HEROES Act proposed by the House of Representatives, Speaker Pelosi and the New York members. It is essential that the Senate include the HEROES Act provision on the repeal of SALT in the final bill,” Cuomo stated in the letter. “The Federal SALT provision passed in 2017 was effectively a theft from the people of the State of New York. That federal action alone is costing New Yorkers as much as $15 billion in additional federal taxes, an average cost of $8,700 impacted New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>He added, “Repealing SALT in the bill is essential. I have publicly called on you to vote against any bill that does not include the SALT reform included in the House bill. New Yorkers have heard too many excuses for too long.”</p>
<p>In terms of state operations, Cuomo said that as a direct result of the pandemic and without additional federal aid, the state will need to reduce funding for hospitals, schools and local governments by 20%.</p>
<p>He noted that the current Republican Senate bill requires full funding for education. If New York State does not receive at least the $14 billion for 2021 and $16 billion for 2022, but must fully fund education, there will be greater cuts to hospitals and local governments.</p>

Larry Hogan</p></div>
<p>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Cuomo, the National Governors Association chair and vice chair respectively, released a statement today calling for Congress to include $500 billion in unrestricted aid to state governments as part of the next COVID-relief package.</p>
<p>“Goldman Sachs analysts assert that the measures that Congress has passed to date will cover less than half the expected state shortfalls, even when combined with state rainy day funds,” Hogan and Cuomo stated. “Moody’s Analytics has noted that without federal revenue replacement, state and local governments would need to cut more than $500 billion—shaving two full percentage points off the GDP and eliminating more than 3 million jobs.”</p>
<p>The two governors stated that nearly every category of state and local revenue is experiencing pandemic-related losses. States and localities that rely on income taxes are seeing much lower revenue due to high unemployment and sales tax income is also declining due to the sharp drop in consumer spending and store closures. Limited travel also means less revenue from gasoline taxes for transportation projects, they noted.</p>
<p>“We stand firm in our request for federal aid in the amount of $500 billion over the next three years,” Hogan and Cuomo stated. “This will ensure a strong recovery for our nation. It is time for Congress to come together to help restore our nation’s health and economy.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As the HGAR Professional Standards Administrator, I often get calls and e-mails from members of the public and/or Realtors looking to file a complaint against a Realtor who is acting unethically. Usually, after a lengthy discussion, it’s revealed that the Realtor being complained about isn’t acting unethically, they’re simply acting unprofessionally. Topping the list of unprofessional actions: being rude and yelling at people.</p>
<p>Often Realtors are not portrayed in the kindest light, often ranking up there with lawyers and used car salesmen. That image is propagated by agents acting unprofessionally. Interestingly, years ago NAR began to take notice of this problem and created the “Pathways to Professionalism;” a list of professional courtesies intended to be used by Realtors on a voluntary basis. They are simple, thoughtful, and beneficial to all and I feel that this list can go a long way in creating a positive rapport with clients, other agents, and the public.</p>
<p>Because of the pressures imposed by the current state of affairs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised social concerns, common courtesies and professionalism is suffering in our industry. Therefore, I thought this would be the perfect time to introduce, or re-introduce as the case may be, these important tips. As a final note, some of these suggestions may be inapplicable at the present time (i.e. showings of occupied homes, etc.); however, they should be utilized in the future. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Pathways to Professionalism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Respect for the Public</strong></p>
<p>1. Follow the “Golden Rule”—Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</p>
<p>2. Respond promptly to inquiries and requests for information.</p>
<p>3. Schedule appointments and showings as far in advance as possible.</p>
<p>4. Call if you are delayed or must cancel an appointment or showing.</p>
<p>5. If a prospective buyer decides not to view an occupied home, promptly explain the situation to the listing broker or the occupant.</p>
<p>6. Communicate with all parties in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>7. When entering a property, ensure that unexpected situations, such as pets, are handled appropriately.</p>
<p>8. Leave your business card if not prohibited by local rules.</p>
<p>9. Never criticize a property in the presence of the occupant.</p>
<p>10. Inform occupants that you are leaving after showings.</p>
<p>11. When showing an occupied home, always ring the doorbell or knock—and announce yourself loudly—before entering. Knock and announce yourself loudly before entering any closed room.</p>
<p>12. Present a professional appearance at all times; dress appropriately and drive a clean car.</p>
<p>13. If occupants are home during showings, ask their permission before using the telephone or bathroom.</p>
<p>14. Encourage the clients of other brokers to direct questions to their agent or representative.</p>
<p>15. Communicate clearly; don’t use jargon or slang that may not be readily understood.</p>
<p>16. Be aware of and respect cultural differences.</p>
<p>17. Show courtesy and respect to everyone.</p>
<p>18. Be aware of—and meet—all deadlines.</p>
<p>19. Promise only what you can deliver—and keep your promises.</p>
<p>20. Identify your Realtors and your professional status in contacts with the public.</p>
<p>21. Do not tell people what you think—tell them what you know.</p>
<p><strong>Respect for Property</strong></p>
<p>1. Be responsible for everyone you allow to enter a listed property.</p>
<p>2. Never allow buyers to enter a listed property unaccompanied.</p>
<p>3. When showing a property, keep all members of the group together.</p>
<p>4. Never allow unaccompanied access to a property without permission.</p>
<p>5. Enter a property only with permission even if you have a lockbox key or combination.</p>
<p>6. When the occupant is absent, leave the property as you found it (lights, heating, cooling, drapes, etc.). If you think something is amiss (e.g., vandalism) contact the listing broker immediately.</p>
<p>7. Be considerate of the seller’s property. Do not allow anyone to eat, drink, smoke, dispose of trash, use bathing or sleeping facilities or bring pets. Leave the house as you found it unless instructed otherwise.</p>
<p>8. Use sidewalks; if weather is bad, take off shoes and boots inside the property.</p>
<p>9. Respect sellers’ instructions about photographing or video graphing their properties’ interiors or exteriors.</p>
<p><strong>Respect for Peers</strong></p>
<p>1. Identify your Realtor and professional status in all contacts with other Realtors.</p>
<p>2. Respond to other agents’ calls, faxes, and e-mails promptly and courteously.</p>
<p>3. Be aware that large electronic files with attachments or lengthy faxes may be a burden on recipients.</p>
<p>4. Notify the listing broker if there appears to be inaccurate information on the listing.</p>
<p>5. Share important information about a property, including the presence of pets, security systems and whether sellers will be present during the showing.</p>
<p>6. Show courtesy, trust and respect to other real estate professionals.</p>
<p>7. Avoid the inappropriate use of endearments or other denigrating language.</p>
<p>8. Do not prospect at other Realtors’ open houses or similar events.</p>
<p>9. Return keys promptly.</p>
<p>10. Carefully replace keys in the lockbox after showings.</p>
<p>11. To be successful in the business, mutual respect is essential.</p>
<p>12. Real estate is a reputation business. What you do today may affect your reputation—and business—for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>We should all strive to be better agents and the Pathway to Professionalism is a great guideline for all Realtors to use and, before I conclude, I would like to contribute a few “obvious” additional suggestions myself:</p>
<p>• Be kind. You don’t know what someone else is going through.</p>
<p>• Don’t swear. It only diminishes your respectability.</p>
<p>• Act with integrity. Once lost, it’s nearly impossible to regain.</p>
<p>• Don’t raise your voice. Just because you’re the loudest, doesn’t make you right.</p>
<p>• Listen before speaking. As the saying goes, “You have two ears and one mouth.”</p>
<p>• Don’t lie. Lies will always find their way back to you.</p>
<p>• Don’t cheat. Cheating will only diminish your moral character.</p>
<p>• Don’t steal. It’s a crime. Nothing more needs to be said.</p>
<p>• Find middle ground in discussions. Identify things you agree upon before you address things you disagree upon.</p>
<p>• And finally, one that was told to me when I was young…always act as if your parents are standing next to you. Would you make them proud? If not, rethink it.</p>

Andrew Cuomo on Aug. 3 signed a bill (S6874-A/ A8903-A) that explicitly grants the Department of State the authority to discipline real estate professionals found to have violated provisions of the state Human Rights Law by revoking or suspending their license.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The fallout from an investigation late last year by <em>Newsday</em> that uncovered housing discrimination practices on Long Island has led to new harsh regulations imposed by New York State, including possible suspension or revocation of a Realtor’s license if found to have violated the state’s Human Rights Law.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Aug. 3 signed a bill (S6874-A/ A8903-A) that explicitly grants the Department of State the authority to discipline real estate professionals found to have violated provisions of the state Human Rights Law by revoking or suspending their license.</p>
<p>State officials note that the bill further reinforces the state&#8217;s commitment to combating housing discrimination and strengthens the abilities of the Secretary of State to discipline licensed professionals for discriminatory behavior.</p>
<p>The new law also complements the department&#8217;s existing regulations, which authorize the Secretary of State to discipline licensed agents and brokers that have engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice. The bill signed by the governor went into effect immediately.</p>
<p>On Nov. 17, 2019, <em>Newsday</em> reported the results of an undercover investigation into housing discrimination on Long Island. The probe&#8217;s findings included evidence that state officials noted suggest real estate agents on Long Island engaged in discriminatory conduct with “disturbing frequency.” The discriminatory practices included imposing unequal conditions and steering clients toward certain neighborhoods depending on their perceived race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Immediately following the <em>Newsday</em> report, the governor directed the Division of Human Rights, the Division of Homes and Community Renewal, and Department of State to launch a joint investigation into reports of widespread discrimination among real estate agents on Long Island.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind in New York and the sheer scope and breadth of the unscrupulous and discriminatory real estate practices uncovered on Long Island is repugnant to who we are,&#8221; Gov. Cuomo said. &#8220;While the federal government is focused on gutting fair housing regulations that have helped so many Americans, we are vastly expanding the state&#8217;s ability to crack down on unethical real estate agents and protect hard-working New Yorkers looking for a community to call home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new law was praised by top officials with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors President Gail Fattizzi said, “Housing discrimination is absolutely unacceptable in any shape or form. It&#8217;s unfortunate that we have to put these significant sanctions in place to enforce what has long been the law, but I&#8217;m glad to see New York State make such a strong statement of zero tolerance.”</p>
<p>Richard Haggerty, chief executive officer of HGAR, added, “As an industry there can be no ambiguity when it comes to our commitment to fair housing. If an agent is found to have violated applicable fair housing laws and engaged in discriminatory activities, they should be out of the business, period.”</p>
<p>In December, 2019, Gov. Cuomo announced new regulations for real estate professionals to help combat discrimination in the housing market statewide. The new regulations, which were approved by the New York State Real Estate Board, mandated enhanced disclosures by real estate professionals to help ensure prospective home buyers, renters, sellers and landlords receive ample information about their rights and protections under New York State law.</p>
<p>The governor also announced several additional initiatives to combat housing discrimination across New York State, which included launching a comprehensive social media campaign and housing discrimination hotline to raise awareness.</p>
<p>He also recently launched a statewide effort to analyze and address segregated living patterns and housing disparities in New York. The state is moving forward with the Fair Housing Matters NY initiative, despite the Trump administration recently stripping away the bedrocks of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, or AFFH, enacted in 2015, that requires states and local municipalities to analyze and develop meaningful actions to reduce segregated living patterns and concentrated areas of poverty, address unequal access to opportunity in neighborhoods, increase accessibility and strengthen fair housing enforcement.</p>
<p>New York State will continue to adhere to the standards and process set forth by the 2015 regulations with the Fair Housing Matters NY initiative. State officials noted that the goal of the initiative is to solicit input from community leaders, nonprofit organizations, housing professionals and residents on housing choice and access to housing opportunity.</p>
<p>The New York State Association of Realtors Legislative Steering Committee directed NYSAR staff to advocate for its passage during this legislative session.</p>
<p>In its Memorandum of Support, NYSAR stated, “Realtors fundamentally support equal opportunity in housing and are committed in our opposition to all forms of illegal discrimination. We believe codifying the Department of State’s authority to discipline real estate licensees for violations of Fair Housing and Human Rights Laws will benefit New Yorkers and serve to elevate the real estate profession.”</p>
<p>NYSAR noted that the bill by expressly naming Human Rights Law violations in the provisions will therefore clarify the department’s authority and further assist in the advancement of Fair Housing practices across the state.</p>
<p>“Maintaining the integrity of Fair Housing policies in New York is of the utmost importance. NYSAR looks forward to partnering with state lawmakers and state agencies to advance this proposal, as well as other policy proposals such as the fairness in cooperative homeownership act, which seek to eliminate forms of illegal discrimination in the home purchasing process,” NYSAR stated.</p>
<p>Bill sponsor New York State Senator James Gaughran (D-5-Syosset) said, &#8220;This law will provide teeth to the enforcement of New York&#8217;s Human Rights Law and ensure that real estate agents cannot engage in racist practices like ‘steering&#8217; that deny families the dignity of choosing their home and neighborhood. I thank Governor Cuomo for his swift singing of this bill into law.”</p>
<p>Assemblymember Kimberly Jean-Pierre (D-11-Lindenhurst), the sponsor of the Assembly bill, noted, &#8220;Homeownership is the cornerstone of the American Dream, yet in this day and age, housing discrimination still persists in our Long Island neighborhoods and across New York. This legislation will help ensure that we are protecting every New Yorker&#8217;s freedom to choose where they want to call home and build a future for themselves, regardless of the color of their skin. I look forward to continuing to work on this critical issue with Governor Cuomo and my colleagues in the Legislature, and I applaud and thank the Governor for swiftly signing this bill into law.&#8221;</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Newspapers, online publications, blogs, and broadcast media are continuously touting the mass exodus from The Big Apple.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Since early spring, when the coronavirus hit the New York metro area hard, headlines have been screeching about the residential flight from Manhattan and other parts of New York City.</p>
<p>Newspapers, online publications, blogs, and broadcast media are continuously touting the mass exodus from The Big Apple.</p>
<p>High-end luxury condo owners to students and young professionals sharing moderate apartments have fled the area in search of temporary or permanent housing in suburban New York or even out of state. Many also fear the recent rash of rioting and calls to defund the New York City Police Department have only added to the migration elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, Manhattan real estate broker Michael Shapot of Compass, believes the flight will be temporary and that buyers and renters will be coming back. “Yes, the virus did create a situation where people were stuck at home in close quarters and many did make a move to the suburbs or other parts of the country,” he said. “But, New Yorkers as a rule are a resilient bunch and I think people recognize there there’s only one New York City. Manhattan is the financial center of the country, we have the best medical and educational facilities and culturally, we’re second to none.”</p>
<p>Shapot and his team deal mostly with condo and co-op sales, but do handle some rentals as well. Shapot is not worried about what he calls a “knee-jerk” reaction to the recent wave of transitions from Manhattan. “In fact, a woman from France recently contacted me about finding an apartment for her daughter who wants to attend college here,” he said.</p>
<p>His Compass team has also experienced a lot of Manhattan residents looking to upgrade to larger apartments. “Since so many are still working from home, they’re starting to look for extra space like an office or a washer/dryer in the apartment, or some outdoor space like a terrace or patio,” he explained. “The luxury rental market is strong now and I think we’re going to see a change in people’s appetite for housing here in the city.”</p>
<p>Shapot said a typical one-bedroom apartment can start at about $3,500 a month, while two-bedrooms can rent for up to $5,000 a month. On average, one-bedroom co-ops can start at around $600,000, as compared to one-bedroom condos, at about $900.000.</p>
<p>“Very often young people just starting out will share a one-bedroom apartment,” he added. While some college students have temporarily moved back in with their parents in the suburbs, Shapot is confident they will eventually come back to Manhattan.</p>
<p>Landlords, he said, are also more willing to negotiate because they don’t want to have any property sitting empty. “Rental prices are down about 10% to 15% now, and often landlords will throw in a free month or some other incentive,” he said. “I think sellers are also a lot more flexible now.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bryant-Park-Apt.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33035 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bryant-Park-Apt.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="251" /></a>Shapot said Manhattan’s current “hot areas” are Midtown and the Financial District. “People also like to be able to walk to work and to grocery stores and restaurants,” he added.</p>
<p>Tony D’Anzica, broker-owner of Dynamax Realty in Manhattan, has not had quite the same experience as Shapot. Also, a property manager, D’Anzica has had many tenants who temporarily fled Manhattan, and several of them have not yet returned.</p>
<p>“In fact, I had a tenant who postponed moving into an apartment I rented to him several months ago, and recently he just informed me that he is not coming to back to the city at all,” he said. “Now the owner of that condo unit wants to sell it instead of renting it out again.”</p>
<p>Another potential tenant was a Facebook employee being transferred to Manhattan. That deal also went south when Facebook announced it was allowing all employees to work from home. “Now that apartment is still sitting empty and the landlord is not getting any rent,” added D’Anzica. Still another tenant rented a one-bedroom Chelsea apartment for $4,500 a month and left in mid-March. While he’s still paying rent, D’Anzica believes he will probably try to get out of his lease.</p>
<p>A small Morningside Heights luxury building he manages has a total of six apartments—with four of them vacant. “People don’t like being in such close quarters and they’re also nervous about getting into the elevator with others,” he said.</p>
<p>D’Anzica also worries about the city’s post-rioting climate and calls to defund the New York City Police Department. Published reports indicate 64 people were shot in the city over the Fourth of July weekend, leaving 10 dead. New York City also surpassed 400 shootings in the first half of the year for the first time since 2016. In the meantime, headlines continue to blame New York’s Bail Reform program for putting dangerous criminals back on the streets.</p>
<p>One of the buildings D’Anzica manages in northern Manhattan was experiencing continuous theft of packages. “The person suspected of stealing was arrested three times and let out on bail each time, until finally he was caught in the act,” explained D’Anzica. “The homeless problem is also getting out of hand. There are people camping out in front of one of our buildings, and using the area as a bathroom!”</p>
<p>As a result, building owners are now forced to invest more in security measures such as gates and cameras. “Calls to defund the police are making things worse and I don’t see as many cops as before. Tenants are afraid and politicians are not reacting,” he added.</p>
<p>Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer wants to reassure real estate brokers that the New York City Police Department is not going anywhere. “People want police protection and those who are calling for defunding the police are not living in New York,” she said. “I would never call for cutting out the police—that’s insane!”</p>
<p>Brewer recently met with the tenant leaders of the New York City Housing Authority to discuss police protection. “They want cops, good cops,” she added. “We need police to get to know neighborhoods again—the shopkeepers and the people who live there. When you work with the local community, you do very well.”</p>
<div id="attachment_33037" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/homeless-camp.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33037" class=" wp-image-33037" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/homeless-camp.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="282" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33037" class="wp-caption-text">A homeless camp in NYC.</p></div>
<p>Brewer is also working with the New York City Mayor’s office to plan who will handle the homeless situation, which in many cases overwhelms the police department. “Yes, there are too many homeless out there on the streets and we have to determine who will be taking care of those quality of life issues,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the city’s recent rash of rioting and destruction of property was “terrible,” Brewer said she is working with local Business Improvement Districts to help them get up and running again. “This was very hard on local businesses and presented a very negative image of New York.”</p>
<p>Despite the virus and recent rise in crime, Brewer believes Manhattan property values are still the greatest investment anyone can make. “Where else do you have Broadway, Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Symphony and Opera, Greenwich Village, Soho, the best museums and the best food in the world,” she said. “I’ve been here 60 years and I think people will always want to the opportunity to live in Manhattan.”</p>
<p>In an effort to recover from all of the recent statue and monument vandalism, New York City will dedicate the first Women’s Suffrage Statue on the mall at Central Park on August 26.</p>
<p>“From all that’s happened recently, I know people’s fears are real, and my office is working hard to address this,” Brewer added. “I would also suggest that new residents here get involved with their local community boards, so they can help to make a difference in their neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>D’Anzica, however, remains concerned. “I’m really nervous about the future, and I don’t see the city coming out of this any time soon and being where it was,” he admitted. “I still think New York is the greatest city in the world and I’ve always loved it. I’m generally an optimistic person, so I do hope that it will someday bounce back.”</p>
<p>“I know there has been a spike in crime, but we haven’t been experiencing a lot of fear and anxiety with our clients,” said Shapot. “My crystal ball is a little cloudy now and it’s a “big unknown” for the fall, but I always believe that the glass is half full and we’ll have a strong market going into next year.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Vornado also released its second quarter financial results and the tremendous impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic on its operations and finances.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Vornado Realty Trust announced on Aug. 3 that Facebook has leased all of the office space at The Farley Building totaling 730,000 square feet in Vornado’s Penn District.</p>
<p>Vornado also released its second quarter financial results and the tremendous impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic on its operations and finances.</p>
<p>The Farley Building is a cornerstone of Vornado’s new Penn District, where Vornado owns 10 million square feet and is in the midst of a more than $2 -billion district-wide transformation of the neighborhood alongside government infrastructure and transportation improvements of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>The Farley Building occupies a double-wide block between 31st and 33rd streets and stretches from 8th to 9th Avenues and is adjacent to Penn Station and across the street from Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>Farley is an iconic Beaux Arts New York City landmark designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White that Vornado is converting into a state-of-the-art, mixed-use development featuring best-in-class creative office space, while retaining the rich history of the building’s original design. Farley’s large floorplates offer a horizontal campus unique to Manhattan and similar to tech offices in Silicon Valley. The full complex will include Facebook’s office space; the majestic Moynihan Train Hall; and 120,000 square feet of retail space with food and beverage, full-service restaurants and curated lifestyle brands. The project is expected to be completed in phases beginning by year-end 2020.</p>
<p>Steven Roth, chairman and CEO of Vornado, said, “We are delighted to welcome Facebook to The Farley Building, a property like no other in New York City. Facebook’s commitment to Farley expands our long-standing relationship and advances our vision for the Penn District, the new epicenter of Manhattan. Facebook’s commitment is a further testament to New York City’s extraordinary talent and reinforces New York’s position as the nation’s second tech hub.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Vornado%E2%80%99s-Farley-Building-Aerial-View.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33081 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Vornado’s-Farley-Building-Aerial-View.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="322" /></a>&#8220;Facebook first joined New York’s vibrant business and tech community in 2007. Since that time, we’ve continuously grown and expanded our presence throughout the city. The Farley Building will further anchor our New York footprint and create a dedicated hub for our tech and engineering teams. We look forward to being a part of this iconic New York City landmark’s future for years to come,&#8221; said Robert Cookson, VP of Real Estate and Facilities, Americas, EMEA and APAC at Facebook.</p>
<p>In New York City, in addition to The Farley Building, Facebook leases office space at Vornado’s 770 Broadway and in nearby Hudson Yards. The Farley development is owned 95% by Vornado and 5% by The Related Companies.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement in connection with the Facebook lease, stating, “This is a significant moment in New York&#8217;s road to build back better and stronger and demonstrates our continuing resilience. Once complete, the Penn-Farley complex will be a world-class 21st century transportation, retail and business hub that maintains its extraordinary and historic architectural character. Vornado&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s investment in New York and commitment to further putting down roots here—even in the midst of a global pandemic—is a signal to the world that our brightest days are still ahead and we are open for business. This public-private partnership fortifies New York as an international center of innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>COVID 19’s Impact on Vornado’s Finances</strong></p>
<p>Vornado Realty Trust also released its second quarter financial results on Aug. 3. The firm reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 at $197,750,000, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.400 billion, or $12.56 per diluted share, for the prior year&#8217;s quarter. Adjusting for the items that impact period-to-period comparability listed in the table on the following page, net loss attributable to common shareholders, as adjusted (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was $8,599,000, or $0.04 per share, and net income attributable to common shareholders, as adjusted for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was $42,552,000, or $0.22 per diluted share.</p>
<p>The REIT noted in its financial disclosures that its properties, concentrated in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco, have been adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures taken to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Some of the effects of the pandemic delineated in its report included:</p>
<p>• With the exception of grocery stores and other &#8220;essential&#8221; businesses, many of its retail tenants closed their stores in March 2020 and began reopening when New York City entered phase two of its state-mandated reopening plan on June 22, 2020.</p>
<p>• While its buildings remain open, many of its office tenants are working remotely.</p>
<p>• It has temporarily closed the Hotel Pennsylvania and has cancelled trade shows at theMART for the remainder of 2020.</p>
<p>• As of April 30, 2020, Vornado placed 1,803 employees on temporary furlough, which included 1,293 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York properties, 414 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania and 96 corporate staff employees. As of July 31, 2020, 542 employees have been taken off furlough and returned to work, which included 503 employees of BMS and 39 corporate staff employees.</p>
<p>In terms of its tenant lease obligations, Vornado stated, “While we believe our tenants are required to pay rent under their leases, in limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and rent abatements for certain of our tenants.”</p>
<p>For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Vornado collected 88% (94% including rent deferrals) of rent due from our tenants, comprised of 93% (98% including rent deferrals) from its office tenants and 72% (78% including rent deferrals) from its retail tenants. Rent deferrals generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period not to exceed 12 months.</p>
<p>Based on its assessment of the probability of rent collection of its lease receivables, Vornado has written off $36,297,000 of receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents, primarily for the JCPenney lease at Manhattan Mall and the New York &amp; Company, Inc. lease at 330 West 34th Street, both tenants have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and $8,822,000 of tenant receivables deemed uncollectible, resulting in a reduction of lease revenues and its share of income from partially owned entities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Prospectively, revenue recognition for these tenants will be based on actual amounts received.</p>
<p>Vornado stated that the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its finances and operating results remain “highly uncertain but the impact could be material.” Those impacts could include lower rental income and potentially lower occupancy levels at its properties.</p>
<p>Vornado also reported that it has concluded that its investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV is &#8220;other-than-temporarily&#8221; impaired and recorded a $306,326,000 non-cash impairment loss, before non-controlling interests of $467,000, on its consolidated statements of income for the second quarter of 2020.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On July 27, 2020, the Senate introduced eight bills, referred to as the Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools Act (HEALS Act), that would offer additional relief for individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. On July 31, 2020, an important element of the previously enacted COVID-19 relief packages, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program benefit expired. The PUA offered individuals, as well as independent contractors (for the first time), who lost their jobs or incomes due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the ability to apply for an additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits, supplementing the existing unemployment benefits individuals were entitled to under state law.</p>
<p>On July 29, 2020, the National Association of Realtors, released a helpful summary highlighting the important elements of the HEALS Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2Pqz8JO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2Pqz8JO</a>). The eight bills within the HEALS Act are as follows: (1) Emergency Appropriations provisions (see <a href="https://bit.ly/39ZDi4D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39ZDi4D</a>); (2) the Safeguarding America’s Frontline Employees to Offer Work Opportunities Required to Kickstart the Economy (SAFE TO WORK) Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/31jWd6d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/31jWd6d</a>); (3) the American Workers, Families, and Employers Assistance Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/30unPGS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/30unPGS</a>); (4) the Continuing Small Business Recovery and Paycheck Protection Program Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3i2u7De" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3i2u7De</a>) (the “Continuing PPP Act”); (5) the Safely Back to School and Back to Work Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3fxugwN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3fxugwN</a>); (6) the Supporting America’s Restaurant Workers Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/39UMuax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39UMuax</a>); (7) the Restoring Critical Supply Chains and Intellectual Property Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3gy7OFi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3gy7OFi</a>); and (8) the Time to Rescue United States Trusts Act of 2020 (TRUST Act) see<a href="https://bit.ly/2Xt2Odt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/2Xt2Odt</a>).</p>
<p>At press time, the White House and Senate Republicans, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have yet to come to an agreement on the proposed HEALS Act. The summary provided by NAR focuses on those aspects of the HEALS Act that “most directly impact Realtors, consumers and the real estate industry as a whole.” Hopefully, the provisions of the HEALS Act are agreed upon, but there are several areas of disagreement. For example, Democrats would like to maintain the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance payments at $600 per week, as well as eliminating the controversial SALT deductions for 2020 and 2021 (see <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article at <a href="https://on.wsj.com/3gKvHK5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.wsj.com/3gKvHK5</a>). Below are just some of major elements of the HEALS Act.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Improvements to the Paycheck Protection Program</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility of 501(c)(6) Tax Exempt Organizations</strong></p>
<p>Under the newly proposed Continuing PPP Act, an organization exempt under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code would now be eligible to receive a Payroll Protection Program loan. NAR was a major advocate of this provision. A 501(c)(6) tax exempt entity was not eligible under the original CARES Act to receive a PPP loan, and, unfortunately, many Realtor Associations, and other trade organizations, are 501(c)(6) tax exempt organizations. The newly proposed provisions would allow a 501(c)(6) entity to apply for a PPP loan, provided that:</p>
<p>(a) the organization does not receive more than 10% of its receipts from lobbying activities;</p>
<p>(b) the lobbying activities of the organization do not comprise more than 10% of the total activities of the organization;</p>
<p>(c) the organization employs not more than 50 employees; and</p>
<p>(d) the covered loan is not more than $500,000.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Eligible Expenses Under the PPP</strong></p>
<p>According to NAR, Section 101 of the Continuing PPP Act would make the following additional expenses permissible, and forgivable, when paid using PPP loan funds:</p>
<p>• Expenses and payments made for any software, cloud computing and other human resources and accounting needs.</p>
<p>• Expenses related to property damage due to public disturbances that occurred during 2020 that are not covered by insurance.</p>
<p>• Expenditures to a supplier pursuant to a contract for goods in effect prior to Feb. 15, 2020 that are essential to the recipient’s current operations.</p>
<p>• Investments in and expenses paid in connection with personal protective equipment and other investments made, and expenses paid, in connection with required compliance with federal COVID-19 health and safety guidelines between March 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Application for PPP Loan</strong></p>
<p>Section 104 of the Continuing PPP Act provides for a more simplified application process. For loans under $150,000, borrowers would no longer need to provide the documentation originally required under section 1106 of the CARES Act. All borrowers would need to “…attest to a good faith effort to comply with Paycheck Protection Program loan requirements, retain relevant records for three years, and may complete and submit demographic information.” The Small Business Administration would reserve the right to review and audit any PPP loans to ensure there is no fraud and that the information provided is accurate.</p>
<p>For loans between $150,000 and $2 million, borrowers would not be required to submit to the lender documentation originally required by section 1106 of the CARES Act, but must “…complete the certification required by that section [rather than simply attest as indicated above for loans under $150,000], retain relevant records and worksheets for three years and may complete and submit demographic information.” Upon reviewing the borrower’s application, the lender may then submit the loan to the SBA.</p>
<p><strong>The Second-Draw Provision of the Proposed Continuing PPP Act</strong></p>
<p>A new and important element of the Continuing PPP Act is the inclusion of Section 106. This provision would allow eligible businesses to apply for a second draw from the PPP loan program. As summarized by the Senate, eligible entities must:</p>
<p>• meet the SBA’s revenue size standard, if applicable;</p>
<p>• employ not more than 300 employees; and</p>
<p>• demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in gross receipts in the first or second quarter of 2020 relative to the same 2019 quarter.</p>
<p>Section 106 defines “eligible entities” as “any business concern, nonprofit organization, veterans’ organization, Tribal business concern, eligible self-employed individual, sole proprietor, independent contractor or small agricultural cooperative.” The new law would also specifically exclude businesses listed on a national securities exchange, which was a hot button issue with the passage of the initial PPP loan program.</p>
<p>Borrowers would be eligible to receive a loan amount of up to 2.5 times the average total monthly payroll costs in the one year prior to the loan, up to $2 million. For newer entities without a full year of expenses, the calculation would be 2.5 times the sum of total monthly payments divided by the total number of months in which payments were made. Further, an eligible entity may only receive one covered loan and any businesses which received a PPP loan may not receive another SBA loan that totals more than $10 million combined.</p>
<p>Borrowers of a “Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw” loan would be “…eligible for loan forgiveness equal to the total payroll costs, covered mortgage payments, rent, utility payments, covered operations expenditures, covered property damage costs, covered supplier costs and covered worker protection expenditures that is incurred before Jan. 1, 2021.” The 60/40 cost allocation between payroll and non-payroll costs as approved in the PPP legislation that passed in June would still apply in order to qualify for forgiveness. The new legislation would set aside $25 billion in funds for businesses employing 10 or fewer employees, and would also “prioritize underserved communities.”</p>
<p><strong>Business Liability Protections Under the Safe to Work Act</strong></p>
<p>Under the Safe To Work Act (see<a href="https://bit.ly/3fs1Jc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/3fs1Jc8</a>), Congress has a duty to “…safeguard its investment of taxpayer dollars under the CARES Act and other coronavirus legislation. Congress must ensure that those funds are used to help businesses and workers survive and recover from the economic crisis, and to help health care workers and health care facilities defeat the virus.” The Safe To Work Act’s purpose is to:</p>
<p>(1) establish necessary and consistent standards for litigating certain claims specific to the unique coronavirus pandemic;</p>
<p>(2) prevent the overburdening of the court systems with undue litigation;</p>
<p>(3) encourage planning, care, and appropriate risk management by small and large businesses, schools, colleges and universities, religious, philanthropic and other nonprofit institutions, local government agencies and health care providers;</p>
<p>(4) ensure that the nation’s recovery from the coronavirus economic crisis is not burdened or slowed by the substantial risk of litigation;</p>
<p>(5) prevent litigation brought to extract settlements and enrich trial lawyers rather than vindicate meritorious claims;</p>
<p>(6) protect interstate commerce from the burdens of potentially meritless litigation;</p>
<p>(7) ensure the economic recovery proceeds without artificial and unnecessary delay;</p>
<p>(8) protect the interests of the taxpayers by ensuring that emergency taxpayer support continues to aid businesses, workers and health care providers rather than enrich trial lawyers; and</p>
<p>(9) protect the highest and best ideals of the national economy, so businesses can produce and serve their customers, workers can work, teachers can teach, students can learn and believers can worship.</p>
<p>The Safe To Work Act provides for “…rules governing liability for certain coronavirus-related tort claims, protecting businesses, nonprofits, and individuals.” First, a plaintiff must establish by “clear and convincing evidence” that a defendant caused harm or injury. A defendant, however, may avail himself or herself of a “safe harbor” and avoid liability if he or she “(1) ha[s] made reasonable efforts to comply with applicable public health guidelines, and (2) has not engaged in willful misconduct or grossly negligent behavior.” If passed, this new legislation would make it more difficult for a plaintiff to prevail against a defendant, as the plaintiff would have to show that the defendant acted recklessly. One element of the legislation is that a one-year statute of limitations would apply. It also allows a case to be moved to federal court. Additionally, the legislation would “…impose limits on compensatory damages, and prohibits punitive damages (except for willful misconduct).”</p>
<p><strong>Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program</strong></p>
<p>One of the main points of disagreement between the White House and Senate Republicans, and the House Democrats is how to deal with the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program. The new HEALS Act would provide $200 supplemental payments per week through September 2020, in addition to state benefits. Under the CARES Act, the PUA payments were $600 per week through July 31st. These $600 payments were also in addition to the state unemployment benefits. Ultimately, some of those receiving both state unemployment benefits and PUA supplemental payments were making more in unemployment benefit income than from their employment.</p>
<p>The new legislation would then provide, beginning in October, that the supplemental unemployment benefit would be replaced with a payment of up to $500 per week, which when combined with the state unemployment benefits, would replace 70% of lost wages. The Republicans argue that keeping the benefit at a level that is higher than the individual’s actual income is a disincentive to return to work. Ultimately, the number will likely fall somewhere in the middle. The HEALS Act also provides states with additional funding of up to $1.15 billion for processing unemployment claims and make additional technological upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>A Resolution is Needed Soon</strong></p>
<p>While it is imperative for both sides to come to an agreement, it is also important for both sides to get it right. The pandemic has forced our leaders to provide unprecedented stimulus and aid to individuals, businesses, state governments and the entire country as a whole. However, no matter what happens, there will surely be a need for additional assistance in the future. The COVID-19 virus is an enemy that we have not seen the likes of in history. Our leaders will need to come together to fight this enemy. The death and despair that has been caused by the virus worldwide is devasting, and our hearts go out to every single person that has lost a life or a loved one, or has been affected in any way by this formidable enemy. It will take the will of all people to come together and fight this until it is defeated. While we eagerly await a vaccine, we and our leaders must continue to do all that can be done on both a personal and economic level.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ 104th Annual Meeting &amp; Member Appreciation Day will be like none other in the association’s history.</p>
<p>The October gathering, which normally draws more than 1,200 Realtors and related professionals to the DoubleTree Hotel in Tarrytown, will be held virtually this year, via Zoom webinar, for safety concerns as the region and the country continue to come to grips with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“While many restaurants and retail businesses have opened with limited seating or hours, other large venues like fitness clubs, movie theaters and Broadway remain closed. There is still considerable caution that needs to be taken regarding large gatherings in order to control the spread of COVID-19,” explained Richard Haggerty, HGAR’s Chief Executive Officer. “In light of guidance from federal and state agencies, we have made the difficult decision to hold our annual Member Appreciation Day virtually this year.”</p>
<p>Instead of reserving just one day this year, Member Appreciation Day will be broken up into two days—Monday, October 26 and Tuesday, October 27. Incorporating the theme of “So Many Ways to Win,” Members Day 2020 will feature a series of interesting breakout sessions on October 26, and the Keynote address and Annual Meeting on October 27.</p>
<p>The proposed roster includes four breakout sessions offering: Stress Management, Marketing &amp; Promotion, a Global Business Panel discussion and Tax Savings.</p>
<p>The following day will feature international speaker, consultant and sales trainer Ricky Mendez. As President, VP of Sales, and COO of companies spanning southern California over the last 10 years, he has overseen operations in excess of a half a billion dollars. His simple and easy strategies have helped thousands improve their quality of life and business. Some of his past clients have included Costco, Home Depot, Humana, Quest, NestSeekers Int. and many more. Even in today’s challenging climate, Mendez will demonstrate how this is the greatest time to make an impact on people and grow relationships.</p>
<p>“I love the buzz, the activity, and the networking of our annual in-person Members&#8217; Day event, but a virtual event creates new opportunities. By splitting the event into two days and having every session at a different time, agents will be able to attend remotely no matter where they are, and can also participate in as many sessions as they choose,” said Gail Fattizzi, HGAR President. “We&#8217;ll still have all the excitement of a great keynote speaker, Ricky Mendez, and the anticipation of announcing our Realtor of the Year and Affiliate of the Year! So, I&#8217;m looking forward to the new format, and reaching even more of our members than ever.”</p>
<p>Specific details and limited sponsorship options for Members Day will be coming within the next month. “While we will be together only virtually this year, we are striving to make this just as exciting as ever, and we look forward to being together again at the Doubletree Hotel in 2021,” Haggerty said.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In launching the new <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> regular feature <strong>“Five Questions With,”</strong> the editor and publisher of the print and online newspaper seek to interview key newsmakers of the day and ask probing questions on matters that affect the readership’s business and day-to-day lives, but also provide insight into how and why certain decisions were made.</p>
<p>With those guidelines in mind, the selection of New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson was not a difficult one. In the era of COVID-19, the City of New Rochelle was ground zero for New York State as the original coronavirus positive case in the state was reported on March 2. The nation then watched as a containment zone to prevent the further spread of the dreaded virus was established in about a one-mile section of the Queen City, which ended on March 25.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, thanks to government reform and a rezoning of a major swath of the downtown district, New Rochelle was enjoying an historic and dramatic rise in new development projects, managed by designated developer RXR Realty and Renaissance Downtowns. Has the COVID-19 derailed that economic engine? For the answer to that question and others, see below:</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: It must feel like an eternity, but it is almost five months since the first case of coronavirus in New Rochelle was discovered, which led to the outbreak that caused Gov. Andrew Cuomo on March 10 to order a one-mile containment zone be established in a section of the city. What were your feelings at the time and the unwelcome national notoriety the COVID outbreak brought to the city?</em></p>
<div id="attachment_33161" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JVP_0024.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33161" class=" wp-image-33161" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JVP_0024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33161" class="wp-caption-text">New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson</p></div>
<p><strong>Mayor Bramson:</strong> It was certainly a surreal experience. Dealing with a pandemic would be a challenge under any circumstances, but doing so in the glare of a national spotlight was even more difficult. I would be lying if I did not acknowledge intense concerns in those early days and as the (positive case) numbers continued to escalate, but at the same time felt a sense of pride and gratitude that people in our community confronted the challenge in a measured, mature and mutually supportive way and really rose to the occasion without undue fear and panic.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: How damaging has COVID-19 been to the city and particularly to the development momentum the city was experiencing prior to the outbreak?</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayor Bramson:</strong> In general terms it’s been damaging to New Rochelle just as it’s been damaging to every community. There are many people whose livelihoods have been compromised. Absent federal assistance, it’s likely to have a devastating impact on our municipal budget and of course there are many families who are in mourning for the loss of loved ones. On the specific question of how it is has impacted our development momentum, the answer so far is not at all. There has been no developer or investor that has pulled back and multiple projects are still proceeding roughly on schedule.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: The city, along with the Downtown BID, the Business Council of Westchester, RXR Realty and others have established “Rebound New Rochelle” in response to the pandemic. Can you briefly detail the initiative’s goals and has it made a difference in helping businesses in need?</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayor Bramson:</strong> Our goal is to provide businesses which have been heavily impacted by the COVID slowdown with direct material support using a combination of federal funding and private contributions from RXR (Realty). We are making funds available both to micro-enterprises and to small businesses. Our hope and expectation is that this assistance will help local entrepreneurs weather the storm and emerge from this crisis with viable enterprises.</p>
<p>There is a parallel program that provides rental assistance to residents of our community that meet certain income criteria. That program is also called “Rebound New Rochelle.”</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: Has COVID-19 caused any delay in planned development projects and have any projects been postponed or cancelled due to the pandemic? Also, are you at all concerned about a possible second wave of COVID-19 to affect the region?</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayor Bramson:</strong> The answer is “No” fortunately. It is still unclear how this will play out over the long term. There is a lot of evidence that the New York City housing market has been negatively impacted. It is even possible that the New Rochelle housing market will be strengthened as people look to alternatives to the five boroughs. So, so far things are moving forward as we had hoped and whether there will be a longer-term impact remains to be seen. That impact is just as likely to be positive as it is negative.</p>
<p>Of course, we all should be concerned about the potential for a second wave as well as the interaction with the traditional flu season. We are better prepared in terms of our testing infrastructure, in terms of our understanding of how COVID is transmitted, in terms of metrics through which we can monitor and address the spread of the illness and of course, we have all undergone radical behavioral shifts over the last few months. But, I am still concerned as we look at outbreaks in other parts of the country we know clearly that the crisis is not over and won’t be over until there is a widely available vaccine.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: While we have no idea if the region will face a second wave of the pandemic, in looking back on the past five months, is there any event or moment that affected you personally the most and has there been anything positive to come out of this that you can point to?</em></p>
<div id="attachment_33162" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JVP_0033.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33162" class="wp-image-33162" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JVP_0033.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33162" class="wp-caption-text">Mayor Bramson outside City Hall, New Rochelle</p></div>
<p><strong>Mayor Bramson:</strong> Let me take the second half of that question first. The positive is that our social infrastructure has proven to be strong and resilient. Not-for-profit agencies have stepped up in remarkable fashion. Community organizations, health care providers, distributors of food, housing agencies, all of them have done heroic work and I think as a result of our experience we now have stronger and more durable partnerships between all of these organizations and the city government that will serve us well not only through the crisis but also in just our normal order of business. And, in fact, we have brought on a Director of Community Engagement (Julie Konvisser of Volunteer New York!) whose mission is to nurture those relationships. So, that I think is a long-term positive.</p>
<p>In terms of an event or moment that affected me personally, it’s hard to pick out one, especially given the blur of the last few months. But, I will probably always remember a conversation I had with the City Manager (Charles B. Strome III) early on following a sleepless night in which we discussed a whole series of not-probable but plausible challenges, such as civil unrest, food shortages and food riots, the spread of the illness among our essential workforce; a review of worst-case scenarios and what our response could be and should be in those circumstances. It was an extremely sobering conversation of a kind I never expected to have and I will probably always remember. And, thank goodness that although this has been a very difficult experience, those worst-case scenarios did not materialize.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—In an attempt to take advantage of real estate and business market trends in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Orange County has decided to market more than 250 acres of land adjacent to Route 17 to New York City businesses looking to relocate out of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus recently told<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the county had extended a Request for Proposals from developers and investors to acquire the nearly 260-acre former Camp LaGuardia property in Blooming Grove and Chester. The original RFP deadline for proposals was Aug. 7. The submittal date was extended originally to Sept. 10, but has since been extended until Oct. 8 at 4 p.m., <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has learned.  All site visits must be completed, and questions submitted by Sept. 25.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign to sell Camp LaGuardia includes an ad in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> with an “Escape from New York” theme. The Orange County Industrial Development Agency has provided the county with $25,000 for marketing and advertising the Camp LaGuardia site as the county continues to seek proposals.</p>
<p>“These sites are perfect for commercial development and will provide economic development as well as job opportunities for Orange County residents,” Neuhaus said. “I’m pleased that the county is moving forward to put these properties back on the tax rolls and to productive use, which will be a benefit to not just the county, but also to the City of Newburgh and the Towns of Chester and Blooming Grove.”</p>
<p>“Camp LaGuardia is close to the Heritage Trail and to Route 17, and can become a terrific opportunity for economic growth,” said Orange County Legislator John Vero, who represents Chester. “We need proposals which generate long-term revenue for the county and are compatible with local land use needs. Hopefully, multiple entities can demonstrate some interest in this property.”</p>
<p>The County Legislature voted to acquire Camp LaGuardia, a homeless shelter for New York City residents, in 2007.</p>
<p>The county attempted to have the Camp LaGuardia property redeveloped and retained Mountco Construction of Scarsdale as the developer, but in 2016 spent approximately $1.3 million to terminate the deal with Mountco, which had proposed a $300-million mixed-use development on the property but failed to secure approvals from affected municipalities to allow the project to break ground.</p>
<p>The Camp LaGuardia property features four parcels totaling 258.3 acres including a 153.5-acre parcel in the Town of Chester; a 40.8-acre parcel in the Town of Chester; a 59.6-acre parcel in the Town of Blooming Grove and a 4.4-acre parcel in the Village of Chester.</p>
<p>Orange County has also received two proposals to acquire multiple county-owned buildings on Grand Street in Newburgh, that were also offered through an RFP.</p>
<p>The county acquired the Grand Street Properties in December 2013. The properties include a former YMCA, Masonic Temple and American Legion buildings. The county acquired the Newburgh properties in the hopes of expanding SUNY Orange’s services to those properties.</p>
<p>Boutique hotel and restaurant firm Foster Supply Hospitality of Youngsville, NY has offered Orange County $1 million in cash for the three Grand Street buildings in Newburgh with plans to develop a mixed-use project at the site. According to the firm’s RFP, it intends to develop an 80-room hotel, 20,000 square feet of meeting/event space and a 100-seat restaurant at the three properties.</p>
<p>The project, which has been estimated to cost approximately $20 million, would require a zone change. Foster Supply stated in the RFP that it expects the engineering and zoning approval process to take six to nine months once it has taken control of the site. Construction would take between 14 months to 18 months. It expects to have the hotel open for guests in mid-2022.</p>
<p>Somers-based Kearney Realty and Development Group has also submitted a bid of $250,000 to develop the “Grand Street Revival” that would consist of 60 loft-style apartments, two retail storefronts and one 3,000-square-foot restaurant.</p>
<p>The Orange County Legislature will select the developers who will buy some or all the properties. The RFP for Camp LaGuardia can be found at: <a href="https://www.orangecountygov.com/1968/RFP-Sale-of-former-Camp-LaGuardia-Proper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.orangecountygov.com/1968/RFP-Sale-of-former-Camp-LaGuardia-Proper</a>.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Day says the resolutions will generate additional revenue, help stabilize Rockland’s finances and allow for proper budgetary decision-making for 2021.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW CITY—Saying the county is “being battered from all sides” from the coronavirus and faces significant revenue shortfalls ahead, Rockland County Executive Ed Day submitted three draft Resolutions to the County Legislature on Aug. 18 that include reviving a plan to sell a shuttered county-owned office building and raising the county’s sales tax.</p>
<p>Day says the resolutions will generate additional revenue, help stabilize Rockland’s finances and allow for proper budgetary decision-making for 2021.</p>
<p>The first resolution authorizes the sale of the Sain Building (18 New Hempstead Road, New City) with all proceeds from the sale to be applied to offset any financial losses caused by COVID-19. The original purchase offer for the building in March of 2016 was $4.51 million. The prior sale would have also returned the building to the property tax roles and generated $500,000 in total annual property tax revenue for the Town of Clarkstown, Clarkstown Central School District and County of Rockland. The building was officially closed in December of 2017.</p>
<p>The Rockland County Legislature failed to approve the Sain Building to National Development and subsequently the Massachusetts-based firm notified the county in October 2018 it was no longer interested in acquiring the property.</p>
<div id="attachment_33232" style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ed-Day-file-photo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33232" class=" wp-image-33232" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ed-Day-file-photo.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="376" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33232" class="wp-caption-text">Rockland County Executive Ed Day<br />FILE PHOTO</p></div>
<p>“We are facing never before seen impacts on our budget and need to do everything possible to decrease spending while finding ways to increase revenue; through our previous actions we have reduced year over year spending by more than $18 million at the end of June. But between the predicted revenue shortfall of $40 million to $50 million and New York State now cutting 20% of promised state aid and reimbursements we are being battered from all sides,” Rockland County Executive Day said. “If we just accepted this fiscal situation it would result in the need for 200 layoffs. That is why we need to take these additional steps to protect our employees from possible layoffs and property taxpayers from the double-digit rate increases of the past.”</p>
<p>The second resolution calls for the temporary addition of one-half of one percent to the local sales tax to take effect Dec. 1, 2020, or as soon thereafter as possible, for a period of three years until Nov. 30, 2023. The resolution would also need to be passed by the New York State Legislature and signed by Governor Cuomo. The current sales tax rate in Rockland County is 8 and 3/8ths percent, this resolution would raise it to 8 and 7/8ths percent equal to the rate of Yonkers and New York City.</p>
<p>The third resolution would push back the 2021 proposed County Budget submission requirement from Oct. 1, 2020, to Oct. 23, 2020. Rockland is due to receive two sales tax disbursements from New York State on or before Oct. 1, 2020, with two additional disbursements due to the county on Oct. 7, 2020, and Oct. 13, 2020. The proposed three-week delay would allow for the collection of more data and therefore a more accurate projection of the 2021 proposed County Budget, Day noted.</p>
<p>“These three resolutions are just the latest actions we have taken to protect taxpayers from the fiscal tsunami caused by the pandemic. The temporary sales tax Resolution is the lynchpin of our ability to successfully navigate these unprecedented times and the passage of all these resolutions by the County Legislature and New York State Legislature will help us continue to chart a responsible path forward. We have already met with legislative leadership and notified every legislator of the criticality and need behind these resolutions,” County Executive Day said.</p>
<p>The County Executive is hopeful the resolutions can pass the County Legislature at its next session on Tuesday, Sept., 1.</p>
<p>Additionally, County Executive Day notified the County Legislature last week that the county would only move forward with $19,975,000 in capital borrowing down from the $40 million that was planned for pre-pandemic. This borrowing reduction will not influence the 2020 Budget but will cut principal and interest payments on these projects from $3 million to $1.5 million in 2021.</p>
<p>The capital spending cut will not impact the start of construction on the long-delayed new facility for the Rockland County Highway Department in Chestnut Ridge. A contract to build the new facility, valued at nearly $35.5 million was recently awarded to Worth Construction of Bethel, CT. The county has previously borrowed funds for a portion of the project.</p>
<p>“We closely reviewed the necessity of each of these projects and are only moving forward with those that are already in progress, those which will show a positive return on investment or those which are critical infrastructure improvements. The last economic recession resulted in the delay of many of these projects and since taking office I have refused to kick the can down the road for future generations of Rocklanders to deal with. But make no mistake, we are moving forward in a fiscally responsible manner and will not repeat the mistakes of the past which led to the $138 million deficit I inherited upon taking office,” said County Executive Day.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Proof that the local home sales market is very strong despite the COVID pandemic can be found in the latest statistics released today by the National Association of Realtors. NAR reports that existing-home sales in the Northeast rose by a record 30.6% in the month of July.</p>
<p>NAR reported that nationwide home sales continued on a strong, upward trajectory in July, marking two consecutive months of significant sales gains. Each of the four major regions attained double-digit, month-over-month increases, although the Northeast was the only region to show a year-over-year decline.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, jumped 24.7% from June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million in July. The previous record monthly increase in sales was 20.7% in June of this year. Sales as a whole rose year-over-year, up 8.7% from a year ago (5.39 million in July 2019).</p>
<p>“The housing market is well past the recovery phase and is now booming with higher home sales compared to the pre-pandemic days,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “With the sizable shift in remote work, current homeowners are looking for larger homes and this will lead to a secondary level of demand even into 2021.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in July was $304,100, up 8.5% from July 2019 ($280,400), as prices rose in every region. July’s national price increase marks 101 straight months of year-over-year gains. For the first time ever, national median home prices breached the $300,000 level.</p>
<p>Total housing inventory at the end of July totaled 1.50 million units, down from both 2.6% in June and 21.1% from one year ago (1.90 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.1-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 3.9 months in June and down from the 4.2-month figure recorded in July 2019.</p>
<p>Yun notes these dire inventory totals have a substantial effect on sales.</p>
<p>“The number of new listings is increasing, but they are quickly taken out of the market from heavy buyer competition,” he said. “More homes need to be built.”</p>
<p>Last week, NAR released its latest data for metro home prices, which found that in 2020’s second quarter, median single-family home prices saw a 96% increase when compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 22 days in July, seasonally down from 24 days in June and from 29 days in July 2019. Sixty-eight percent of homes sold in July 2020 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 34% of sales in July, down from 35% in June 2020 and up from 32% in July 2019. NAR’s 2019 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, released in late 2019, revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 33%.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, purchased 15% of homes in July, up from both 9% in June 2020 and from 11% in July 2019. All-cash sales accounted for 16% of transactions in July, equal to the percentage in June 2020 and down from 19% in July 2019.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in July, down from 3% in June up from 2% in June 2019.</p>
<p>“Homebuyers’ eagerness to secure housing has helped rejuvenate our nation’s economy despite incredibly difficult circumstances,” said NAR President Vince Malta, broker at Malta &amp; Co., Inc., in San Francisco. “Admittedly, we have a way to go toward full recovery, but I have faith in our communities, the real estate industry and in NAR’s 1.4 million members, and I know collectively we will continue to mount an impressive recovery.”</p>
<p>Realtor.com’s Market Hotness Index, measuring time-on-the-market data and listing views per property, revealed that the hottest metro areas in July were Topeka, KA; Rochester, NY; Burlington, NC; Columbus, OH and Reading, PA.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 3.02% in July, down from 3.16% in June. The average commitment rate across all of 2019 was 3.94%.</p>
<p><strong>Single-family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales sat at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.28 million in July, up 23.9% from 4.26 million in June, and up 9.8% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $307,800 in July, up 8.5% from July 2019.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 580,000 units in July, up 31.8% from June and equal to a year ago. The median existing condo price was $270,100 in July, an increase of 6.4% from a year ago.</p>
<p>“Luxury homes in the suburbs are attracting buyers after having lagged the broader market for the past couple of years,” Yun said. “Single-family homes are continuing to outperform condominium units, suggesting a preference shift for a larger home, including an extra room for a home office.”</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>For the second consecutive month, sales for July increased in every region and median home prices grew in each of the four major regions from one year ago.</p>
<p>July 2020 existing-home sales in the Northeast rocketed 30.6%, recording an annual rate of 640,000, a 5.9% decrease from a year ago. The median price in the Northeast was $317,800, up 4.0% from July 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales jumped 27.5% in the Midwest to an annual rate of 1,390,000 in July, up 10.3% from a year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $244,500, an 8.0% increase from July 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South shot up 19.4% to an annual rate of 2.59 million in July, up 12.6% from the same time one year ago. The median price in the South was $268,500, a 9.9% increase from a year ago.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West ascended 30.5% to an annual rate of 1,240,000 in July, a 7.8% increase from a year ago. The median price in the West was $453,800, up 11.3% from July 2019.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The cases of COVID-19 continue to rise and fall from month to month. The economic crisis also continues as the unemployment rate remains above 10%. The MTA is in dire straits and considering eliminating train service west of the Hudson. A total of 20% cuts will be made by state agencies if an aid package from the federal government is not passed by Congress and forthcoming. The housing market, our local bright spot, is currently doing well in the suburbs, which is helping keep the economy afloat.</p>
<p>Currently the House and Senate are at a stalemate over a new COVID relief bill, which is a must have in order for vital services to remain available. Some suggest we may need less, but there is agreement among both parties that New York and the tri state area states need financial aid to get through the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>One of the issues of importance to Realtors and other 1099 practitioners is an extension of pandemic unemployment assistance. This provided an extra $600 a week on top of the current unemployment assistance which Realtors that had lost their source of income were able to access. The $600 component has expired.</p>
<p>Another issue that will be a big help to home owners is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to buy qualified mortgages in forbearance, which will help homeowners to stay afloat. Forbearance allows home owners to stop paying their mortgage for a period of time if they’ve lost their job. There will also be no fees associated with the new round of purchases which will help provide financial stability to the markets and to the consumer.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates on these important issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>LOUDONVILLE, NY—A newly released survey reveals that New Yorkers have deep concerns about the coronavirus in terms of a potential second wave this fall as well as how local school districts and colleges are currently reopening.</p>
<p>A poll released today (Sept. 2) by the Siena College Research Institute found that a little over half of state residents (51%, down from 62% two months ago) think the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is still to come while 34%, up from 27%, think the worst is over.</p>
<p>Eighty-six percent of respondents are somewhat or very concerned that New York will face another large outbreak of COVID-19 in the fall, and 80%, virtually unchanged from 78% in late June, are concerned that they or another member of their household will get sick with the virus.</p>
<p>In terms of school openings, 62% of New Yorkers say completely opening schools runs too great a risk of spreading the disease. A total of 32% said that we have to bring the children back to school and do our best to mitigate the risks. By 66%-27%, New Yorkers say colleges should only deliver remote education and not bring students back to campus for the fall semester.</p>
<p>Given three general approaches to public schools in the fall, 46% are in favor of keeping schools closed for now and providing remote instruction as best as teachers can to all students, 33% prefer providing instruction using a hybrid model where only some students come in each day and many students receive instruction some or all day online whether in the school building or at home, and 18% call to open schools for in person instruction for all students with precautions like social distancing and masks in place.</p>
<p>“As schools across New York grapple with whether to or how to open in the fall, by nearly two to one, New Yorkers say completely opening schools runs too great a risk,” according to SCRI Director, Don Levy. “Despite recognizing how hard not opening is on kids and their families, only a third say that the negative effect on students is too great and that we have to bring the children back to school.”</p>
<p>Levy continued, “Offered a middle ground, the hybrid model in which only some students come in each day, class size is limited and online instruction is part of the education process, one-third of New Yorkers support a hybrid approach. But even with the option of schools using a hybrid approach, 46% still support keeping the schools closed for now and providing remote instruction as best as teachers can to all students.”</p>
<p>In terms of college openings, two-thirds of all New Yorkers, 70% of women, 72% of those 18-34 years of age, 73% of Democrats and a majority, 53%, of Republicans say that colleges should only deliver remote education and not bring students back to campus, Levy noted.</p>
<p>The survey did not have good news for retailers, gym and theater operators. Large majorities of survey respondents are not comfortable with participating in five of six indoor activities. Fifty-eight percent are not comfortable with dining indoors in a restaurant, 72% with having a drink at a bar, 70% with working out at a gym, 73% with watching a movie at a theater and 65% with going to a bowling alley. New Yorkers are more comfortable with visiting a museum with 45% saying they are comfortable and 47% saying that they are not.</p>
<p>The SCRI special Coronavirus Poll was conducted August 20 – 27, 2020 by random telephone calls to 343 New York adults via landline and cell phones and 402 responses drawn from a proprietary panel of New Yorkers.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW CITY—After the Rockland County Legislature narrowly defeated his proposal to increase local sales taxes and sell a shuttered county office building to offset declines in revenues due to COVID-19, Rockland County Executive Ed Day threatened that in response he may be forced to lay off hundreds of county workers and raise taxes by 10% or more.</p>
<p>Rockland County legislators voted 9-8 on Sept. 1 against the County Executive’s resolutions, which sought to obtain home rule approval from the New York State Legislature granting Rockland the authority to increase its local sales tax by one-half of one percent.</p>
<p>Legislators who rejected the proposal said the call for an increase in the county’s sales tax was premature and that many other options needed to be reviewed before increasing what some described as the most regressive of taxes.</p>
<div id="attachment_33376" style="width: 177px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ALDEN-H.-WOLFE-e1599153746461.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33376" class="size-medium wp-image-33376" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ALDEN-H.-WOLFE-167x250.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="250" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33376" class="wp-caption-text">Rockland County Legislative Chairman Alden H. Wolfe</p></div>
<p>“Many people have lost their jobs or had their hours cut, but they still need to make necessary purchases,” Legislature Chairman Alden H. Wolfe said. “Increasing the sales tax on those purchases at this time would serve to make things even harder for these families and for the businesses that could see fewer customers as a result.”</p>
<p>Legislator Wolfe noted that many tools are available to the County Executive as he formulates his proposed 2021 Budget.</p>
<p>A sales tax increase isn’t the only way to bridge a revenue shortfall. Options to the County Executive could include eliminating the 100-plus currently vacant positions in county government, renegotiating vendor contracts, concessions from unions, furloughs, and a property tax increase, Wolfe noted.</p>
<p>The County Executive submitted three resolutions to the Legislature, including the sales tax item. He also wanted the Legislature to allow him to submit his proposed 2021 spending plan by Oct. 23 instead of Oct. 1, the date set by the Rockland County Charter. The budget resolution was deemed not to be legal as the Legislature does not have that authority, Wolfe noted.</p>
<p>The County Executive also wanted the Legislature to declare the Sain property as surplus, deeming it no longer needed for public use and authorizing its sale by public advertisement. Legislator Wolfe said it will be placed on a future agenda. The item had already been scheduled for discussions earlier this year, but the effort was halted by the pandemic. The County Executive has been frustrated by the Legislature’s failure to approve previous sales deals for the county-owned building.</p>
<p>Several legislators who voted against the sales tax resolution said they remained open-minded about the idea, but first wanted to review the County Executive’s proposed financial plan for 2021 and to see what relief may come from the federal government.</p>
<p>“We still have no idea what the federal government will do to help communities across America, but we all hope they will provide some relief,” Legislator Wolfe said. “Like the County Executive, we would prefer to wait until we have more updated financial information before making a decision on increasing the sales tax or any other tax.”</p>
<p>He later added, “It’s provocative to threaten 200 layoffs of county workers as its only one of the myriad options available to the County Executive in preparing his 2021 budget. We all look forward to working collaboratively to ensure all essential services are maintained for our residents and businesses without overburdening anyone.”</p>
<p>County Executive Day in a prepared statement noted that the county has implemented austerity measures, such as a hiring freeze, the elimination of some positions and filed for FEMA reimbursements that have reaped a total of nearly $20 million in year over year savings. However, Day said that the savings fall short in addressing “possibly the worst financial crisis in Rockland’s history.”</p>
<p>“I am extremely disappointed by last night’s complete lack of action by the Democratic Majority members of the Rockland County Legislature. Their vote of disapproval on the financial plan we submitted now puts at risk hundreds of county employees jobs and raises the specter of a double-digit property tax increase,” Day said. “Passage of my plan would have likely resulted in a 2021 County Budget with no layoffs and no property tax increase, but these are the dire alternatives we now face because of their vote and lack of action.”</p>
<p>In his statement, Day concluded, “I am asking that we put aside any further political posturing and work together without delay to the put the people of our county first. We are open to new ideas, alternatives, and conversation; my door is open, but time is in short supply. The time for action is now.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NANUET—While the third quarter 2020 residential sales numbers will not be released by OneKey MLS until next month, Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty executive Joseph Rand in a sneak preview said the region is currently enjoying a very robust sales market.</p>
<p>“The (sales) surge continues,” Rand said. He noted that in August, new deals in contract were up dramatically based on significant pent-up demand. However, although listings were up sharply for the month, inventory was still low and below last year’s levels.</p>
<p>He believes that the market has just about caught up with the transactions delayed during the several months of virtual shutdown in the spring due to the coronavirus.</p>
<div id="attachment_21118" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Joe-Rand-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21118" class="size-full wp-image-21118" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Joe-Rand-1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="224" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-21118" class="wp-caption-text">Joe Rand, Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty</p></div>
<p>In a Facebook live event this morning (Sept. 4), the managing partner of Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty noted that activity in August reflected sales transactions in progress during the months of May, June, and July after most of the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p>He noted that attorneys, title insurance companies and Realtors are very busy dealing with the transaction pipeline from the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>“Right now, scheduling closings is unbelievably hard. Everybody is overworked. There are so many transactions that are trying to close this month. It has been nuts,” Rand related.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Rand said, “September will be the biggest closing month in history.” He later added that third quarter closings will be up sharply from last year and will result in the region reaching third quarter 2019 levels, despite the market pause in March and April due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the brokerage firm’s New York market region, which includes Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Bronx counties, new contracts were up 50.9% in August as comparted to 12 months earlier.</p>
<p>In its New York region, after new contracts fell 53% and 42% in April and May, contracts rose 10% in May, 59% in June and approximately 51% in August. Listings on the other hand were down 73% in April, 40% in May and then rose 3% in June, 46% in July and 40% in August.</p>
<p>Closings regionwide were down 33% in April, 25% in May, 33% in June, 12% in July and were off just 2% in August.</p>
<p>A key data point from Rand’s presentation is that all of its New York markets, with the exception of the Bronx, are currently seeing double-digit percentage increases in the median sale price as compared to 2019. The Bronx, which has been hampered somewhat by the troubled Manhattan market, has still seen an average median price increase of 9%, according to the Rand presentation, which was based on figures supplied by OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>One market that appears to be struggling is the condominium and cooperative market in Westchester County, with sales down a combined 32.8% in August, according to the presentation.</p>
<p>Rand also addressed the issue of New York City residents fleeing for the suburbs. He said that there has been an increase of approximately 40% in the firm’s transactions involving New York City residents purchasing homes in the northern suburbs as compared to last year.</p>
<p>However, he believes that will be a short-term and not a long-term trend, adding that these city residents were likely considering a suburban move and were pushed by the onset of the coronavirus to make the move now rather than later.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Aug. 11, 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed Executive Law (Human Rights Law) §296(2-a) (d)(2) requiring landlords to provide tenants “the use of an animal as a reasonable accommodation to alleviate symptoms or effects of a disability.” It was effective immediately. This protection adds to those already required under federal law. Under this state law, if a tenant were to request a reasonable accommodation to a “no pets” policy, unless the disability is readily apparent, the landlord would be permitted to request a letter from a medical professional or “other professional” stating that the animal assists the person with the disability by alleviating symptoms or effects of the disability.</p>
<p>So, the immediate question is, “What has changed because of the new state law?” First, under the new state law, there is no definition of what is meant by the term “animal.” Under federal law, a service animal, by definition, can only be a dog; however other “assistance” animals other than dogs, certain common household animals, and even some barnyard animals are permissible. Therefore, the state’s broader interpretation, which could benefit the tenant, may permit certain animals that may not otherwise be allowed under federal law.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of who qualifies as an “other professional” is in question, as it too is undefined. Again, without further interpretation from New York State, this may be broadly interpreted; giving tenants broader ability to gain animal approval for a disability by someone other than a medical professional or someone intimate with the tenant’s condition.</p>
<p>While it is currently uncertain how these new laws will be applied, it is important to know that these new laws exist. We will continue to monitor the roll-out of these new laws and their applications over time. During this period, it is important to understand that while Realtors should make this new law known to their clients, they should not be advising landlords on these legal matters and what they should do. Landlords should always consult with their own attorney on these legal matters.</p>
<p><strong>New State Fair Housing Disclosure Law</strong></p>
<p>As we all recall, in November 2019, <em>Newsday</em> reported the results of an undercover investigation into housing discrimination on Long Island. That report found that real estate agents were knowingly and unknowingly engaged in discriminatory conduct. Since then, fair housing has remained not only on the minds of HGAR and its members, but it has also remained on the minds of our state representatives. Gov. Cuomo recently signed legislation explicitly granting the Department of State the authority to discipline real estate professionals found to have violated provisions of the state Human Rights Law by revoking or suspending their license. The bill further reinforces the state&#8217;s commitment to combating housing discrimination and strengthens the abilities of the Secretary of State to discipline licensed professionals for discriminatory behavior. The new law also compliments the department&#8217;s existing regulations, which authorize the Secretary to discipline licensed agents and brokers that have engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>State of Emergency Extended:</strong> Gov. Cuomo extended the current state of emergency for the State of New York until October 4, 2020. As a result, all Executive Orders relating to this emergency will remain in effect, including the continued No Cold Calling mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Eviction Moratorium Extended</strong>: A New York State Chief Administrative Judge issued a new directive that mandates that no existing or new residential eviction warrants can be executed until October 1st, at the earliest.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>No one could have ever imagined all that has transpired over the past several months. The COVID-19 virus began to spread throughout the world earlier this year and within weeks and months it overtook the world and has taken, and continues to take, countless lives. Our hearts go out to all of those who have been affected by this deadly virus and to all who have lost friends and loved ones. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way people interact with one another and the way businesses interact with consumers. People have been forced to rethink how they go about their daily lives. While many businesses have been forced to shut down and go out of business, the real estate industry has been, at least for the time being, one of the bright spots in an otherwise dark and difficult period in our history.</p>
<p><strong>The Good: The Start of the Mini-Housing Boom</strong></p>
<p>In New York, except for those businesses deemed to be “essential”, many businesses were required to shut down and were prohibited from operating. Real estate agents and attorneys, as well as many others, were among those businesses which were not deemed to be essential. From mid-March to early June, the real estate industry in New York was basically at a standstill. However, a small number of real estate transactions involving refinancing and purchase transactions dependent on mortgage financing were able to close because lenders were deemed to be an essential business. In addition, attorneys representing lenders were afforded a limited exemption as well. This relatively minor exception allowed some pending real estate transactions to close rather than be terminated or allowed to fall apart. In retrospect, it was important that these limited transactions were able to close. This gave the New York real estate market (at least outside of New York City) a weak pulse.</p>
<p>In late May and early June, when the attorneys and real estate agents were slowly being permitted to open their businesses, albeit with strict restrictions in place, this allowed one of the most important industries to take off. Within weeks, memories of the pre-economic crisis period (i.e., prior to 2008) soon came back—multiple offers, bidding wars, limited inventory, waiving mortgage and inspection contingencies, etc. It was a mini-housing boom, and within weeks hundreds of closings began to take place. One area that did not recover as quickly was New York City, which was among the hardest hit. In fact, many of those that lived in New York City began looking for housing in other areas such as Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Long Island, to name a few. Many real estate brokers and attorneys have indicated that the past several months have been some of the biggest volume and revenue months they have ever experienced. As a result of the exodus from large population centers, sellers are getting significantly higher prices for their homes.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad: Waiving the Mortgage Contingency and Inspection</strong></p>
<p>During times like these, when inventory is low and demand increasing dramatically, especially due to unforeseen circumstances, buyers are sometimes forced to do things they would not ordinarily do. Multiple offers on a single property are commonplace and many buyers are increasing their bids drastically just so that their offer is accepted. Lately, even when an offer has been accepted, and contracts have been prepared and forwarded to the opposing counsel, a new buyer comes in and offers more. Unfortunately, what results is a buyer waiving mortgage contingencies, waiving inspections, and agreeing to contract terms that may not be favorable to the buyer, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>The Inspection</strong></p>
<p>Two very important items when purchasing a home are the home inspection and the mortgage contingency clause. In southern parts of New York State, such as Westchester County, Putnam County, Rockland County, Orange County, Dutchess County, New York City (the five boroughs), and Long Island, the inspection is usually done prior to the seller and purchaser entering into a formal contract. Upon acceptance of the purchaser’s offer by the seller, the purchaser will conduct an inspection to ascertain that the home is structurally and environmentally sound. Purchasers, upon the advice of their real estate agents and/or their attorneys, will ordinarily conduct a series of inspections, including, but not limited to, engineer’s inspections (e.g., roof, foundation, plumbing, appliances, structural, asbestos, etc.), radon inspections, well inspections, oil tank inspections (for above and underground oil tanks), septic inspections and others.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, many purchasers have elected to proceed with a transaction without having any inspections or have waived their right to conduct some of the abovementioned inspections. New York State is a “Caveat Emptor” or “Buyer Beware” state, which means that if a purchaser waives his or her right to conduct an inspection, that purchaser will take the property subject to any issues which may exist unless specifically included in the contract. Many contracts, unfortunately, contain strict “as is” provisions, which New York courts have uniformly upheld. (See <a href="https://bit.ly/3hhLG1v">https://bit.ly/3hhLG1v</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/33bx3rD">https://bit.ly/33bx3r</a>D). The fear of losing a home is causing purchasers to agree to things that are not recommended and not wise. Sellers use this as added leverage against a purchaser who does want to conduct inspections, but which will take additional time. It is important that purchasers understand what they are giving up and need to be dissuaded from waiving their inspections rights.</p>
<p><strong>The Mortgage Contingency</strong></p>
<p>Another important element of the real estate transaction and real estate contract is the mortgage contingency. Lately, more purchasers are waiving their mortgage contingency and appraisal contingency because they do not want to lose the deal. Normally, waiving the mortgage contingency is a straightforward determination. Most purchasers who waive the mortgage contingency understand that if they do not obtain a mortgage commitment, they will have to complete the transaction on an all-cash basis.</p>
<p>This is a simple decision, if a purchaser has the liquid funds available to purchase the home, then waiving the mortgage contingency is not a big deal. However, recently, the values of homes have been rising fairly rapidly and if a buyer waives the mortgage contingency, then they would be also waiving the appraisal contingency (an integral element of the mortgage commitment contingency provision). Therefore, the value of the home could be considerably less than what they are willing to pay, but purchasers will have no recourse since an appraisal contingency will not be included in the contract of sale. Purchasers should be aware that they could be potentially paying considerably higher than the actual value of the home.</p>
<p><strong>The Ugly: Tenants Causing Real Estate Transactions to Fall Apart</strong></p>
<p>Another important issue that has become an increasingly common impediment to the closing of a real estate transaction due to COVID-19, is the existence of tenancies with respect to the property that is being sold. If there are tenants at a property, then the parties need to address whether the tenant will remain or vacate the premises prior to the closing. Unfortunately, many tenants are not paying rent as a result of losing their employment due to the pandemic and the shutdowns. Attorneys representing a purchaser will normally require that up to the date of closing all rent is current or, in the alternative, will require that the premises be delivered vacant prior to closing. However, in the current environment, this may be impossible and must be addressed prior to entering into contract.</p>
<p>On September 1st, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), using the authority issued under the Executive Order issued by President Trump on August 8th (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3igNCb">https://bit.ly/3igNCb</a>N), issued an order (“CDC Order”) (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2RckYwI">https://bit.ly/2RckYwI</a>) temporarily halting evictions through Dec. 31, 2020. Under the CDC’s Order, tenants who are able to meet certain conditions cannot be evicted provided they can show that they used their best efforts to pay rent and have exhausted all options, they must apply for government rental assistance, and are likely to become homeless due to an eviction proceeding. The CDC Order requires that tenants are still obligated to pay accrued rent or housing payments in accordance with their lease or contract. Landlords may still file an eviction proceeding if the tenant is “…engaging in criminal acts, threatening the health or safety of other residents, and damaging property, among other offenses.” (See <a href="https://bit.ly/33iArkk">https://bit.ly/33iArkk</a>). In New York, the Office of Court Administration has also issued a temporary ban on evictions which is set to expire on October 1st, unless it is extended by the governor or the legislature. While these actions offer assistance to the tenant, the landlord is placed in a very difficult position when it comes to the sale of a property.</p>
<p>In light of the various federal and state orders, an attorney representing the seller should never agree to remove the tenant or agree that the apartment will be delivered vacant. Rather, a provision should be included that allows the seller to pay a sum certain for each tenant that is not able to vacate the premises prior to closing. Otherwise, if the transaction is contingent upon the tenant vacating the property, the transaction will likely fall apart.</p>
<p>On one transaction, a tenant had agreed to vacate the premises prior to closing. One week prior to the closing, the tenant advised the seller that the tenant would not be vacating the premises. In addition, the tenant stopped paying rent to the seller. The seller asked the tenant why she was not going to vacate and why she was not paying rent. The tenant had not lost her job. In fact, the tenant actually admitted she was making more money because she had received a raise, in addition to working overtime. Her response was simple, she did not want to pay because she feared the future and wanted to keep the money. She indicated that she knew she could not be evicted. Fortunately, the seller was able to convince the tenant to leave and pay her rent up to date, and the transaction eventually closed.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Times, But We Will Make It Through</strong></p>
<p>In March, when the shutdowns began and the COVID-19 virus began its attack on New Yorkers, many did not know what the future would bring. It was eerily similar to the feeling many New Yorkers felt on 9-11. Many did not know if we would return to “normal” or if there would be a “new normal.” After several months, and much despair, we have come out of shutdowns and we are fighting back, like we did after that unforgettable day 19 years ago. And, while many businesses did not make it, and many individuals have lost their employment, the economy is recovering—slowly but surely. The real estate industry has been a small bright light during these difficult times and hopefully will help boost other areas of the economy. There are certainly difficulties members of the real estate industry must face in light of this “new normal,” but the focus must always be on coming up with the solutions necessary to tackle these “new” obstacles.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In December of 2018 the Westchester County Executive George Latimer signed legislation into law to guarantee a measure of protection to prospective co-op purchasers.</p>
<p>Thus far, more than 300 rejections of prospective buyers have occurred since the co-op law went into effect. This is an inordinate number of rejections. and there are many questions that remain unanswered regarding the reasons for the rejections.</p>
<p>So far, only two fines have been issued for violations. In many cases the Human Rights Commission did not receive contact information, such as a phone number or e-mail address when they received a rejection notice from a co-op board. They do not have stats on an actual rejection rate. They do not know how many acceptances there have been.</p>
<p>There are significant changes that both HGAR and the Human Rights Commission support. HGAR, and the Human Rights Commission support a mandatory standardized form for use by all co-ops. Both support a mandatory reason in writing that specifies why a person is being denied be provided by the relevant co-op boards. Many Realtors have also stated that the co-op board should be mandated to tell the prospective purchaser the specific financial reasons why they were denied.</p>
<p>Another component of any additional legislation that we support is a mandatory acceptance of an offer after the 60-day timeline (from the time the offer is presented) if the board has not given any response to the prospective purchaser in that time frame. This is viewed as the best way to force the co-op board to act in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Some legislators are suggesting they would support this while other legislators suggest they would not and instead support major fines if the board does not act in 60 days. In every jurisdiction where a co-op law has passed, it included automatic acceptance of the offer if the board did not respond in the time frame that the law mandated, with the exception of Nassau County. Stay tuned for updates as legislation moves forward.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As the real estate industry in the Hudson Valley and the New York City metro region continues to adhere to new practices and safety protocols brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, Realtors’ acceptance and adaption to new technologies have been seen by many observers as critical in preventing the sector’s economic collapse in the spring and fostering the present impressive recovery.</p>
<p>With that in mind, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> turned to someone who for years has been a leader in fostering change and advancing technology in real estate. In his nearly quarter century of service to the National Association of Realtors, CEO Bob Goldberg is perhaps best known for his efforts in transforming the organization into what it is today and driving technology and innovation that has led and will foster the continued evolution of residential and commercial real estate for years to come.</p>
<p>In addition to his many accomplishments at NAR, Goldberg has specifically emphasized the importance of staying ahead of “proptech” or “real estate- and property-focused technology.” Under his leadership, NAR launched the Strategic Business Innovation and Technology Group, designed to drive industry innovation and benefits to NAR members. The group includes an Emerging Technology team, tasked with finding partnerships with organizations, companies and institutions researching and developing new technologies. The team also launched the successful Innovation and Opportunity Investment Summit (iOi), a unique yearly gathering of real estate practitioners, technology innovators and investors to identify opportunities to work together.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as NAR CEO, Goldberg is president of NAR’s investment arm, Second Century Ventures, as well as the highly ranked REACH® technology accelerator. Through those entities, NAR holds positions in a range of technology companies, driving innovation for the benefit of the industry and NAR members. In addition, he is president and CEO of the REALTORS® Information Network, a for profit, wholly-owned subsidiary of NAR, where he’s responsible for oversight of the realtor.com® operating agreement with Move Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: You have been CEO of NAR since 2017 and with the organization for nearly a quarter century, do you think this is the most challenging time the industry has faced?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2017-06-23-announcement-headshot-mainstage-02.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33620 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2017-06-23-announcement-headshot-mainstage-02.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="213" /></a>Goldberg:</strong> Yes, I think it is one that none of us, honestly, have ever experienced, thank goodness. I would say it is our year of resiliency. When you think about it, I say this kiddingly, but when I came in as CEO three years ago and went through extensive interviewing as did lots of other people to be the CEO of the largest trade association in the world, that was never a question I got asked, which is: “How are you going to lead an organization through a pandemic?” And for all of us who are dealing with it every single day, I don’t want to say it’s on the job training, but good leaders and top leaders learn to lead in times of crisis like this.</p>
<p>So, we are clearly living through history. Everything that we are doing every single day to best serve our members from an association perspective is more intense today than ever before. We’ve had to figure out how do we better engage with our members? I always make the comment: “There is no more important time in the value of an association than now.” We have had economic crises before, we’ve had all types of issues that have happened in real estate, but there has been nothing like this before with governmental restrictions on so many things and (the question of)  how do we engage with each other? The one thing I am very proud of is that not only have we risen to the challenge, we have exceeded what I think anybody would have ever imagined as an industry…</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Have agents permanently altered the way they conduct business as a result of COVID and/or has COVID been the catalyst for change and if so please specify?</p>
<p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> I think COVID has been the catalyst for it. People always talk about “The New Normal.” It is really not the New Normal it is the “Now Normal” that’s how I refer to it because we have all been forced to accelerate how we engage in the business itself. The practitioners and our members, who may have been wary of adapting to the technologies that are out there in terms of virtual tours, open houses, electronic closings, remote online notary, these technologies are being put in the front of everything we are doing and I don’t believe as the result of the pandemic when we get to post-pandemic, hopefully sooner versus later, that these things are going to go away. It is going to be a hybrid approach as to how members are conducting business in a new and more efficient way. I think it (COVID-19) accelerated the industry to doing things that have to be done to compete in this new world that we are living in. But it won’t just suddenly go away when the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>The same way with NAR and how the association is engaging with its members. I think we are going to be in a hybrid world where we will be doing things in person and we will be doing things to expand NAR’s reach. I always give a good example of our legislative meetings. We usually come to Washington to lobby on Capitol Hill for our May Legislative Meetings. We get about 8,500 people for that. This year, we had 28,000-plus people for the (virtual) sessions. We had almost four-times the people and we did everything we normally do. We did Virtual Town Halls with members of Congress. We are still doing it, so it doesn’t even have to happen that week.</p>
<p>So, what we have found is a new foundation on which we engage people in Washington. We had a Leadership Live event with NAR’s Leadership Team with our members. We had almost 20,000 people live with us. Within two days after we had over 100,000 members view it. So, I think COVID has forced us to have to do things differently. It was going to happen invariably anyway, but now in order for us all to sustain ourselves, everyone is playing that game… We have found that even some of the smaller “Mom and Pop” shops all the way to the mega-franchises are all doing things that are more advanced today than I have ever seen in this industry.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The real estate industry has bounced back quickly as COVID restrictions have been lifted. A major reason for the rapid turnaround has been the industry&#8217;s use of technology. You have been an advocate of Realtors use of technology and the founder of the Strategic Business Innovation and Technology Group. With that in mind, do you feel that further technological advances are critical to the industry&#8217;s future and are no longer a threat as some had feared?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bob-goldberg-2017-ceo-update.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33619 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bob-goldberg-2017-ceo-update.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="252" /></a>Goldberg:</strong> I think that question is spot-on. I think it is something that will continue to accelerate. Our Emerging Technology group really encompasses what we are doing in our Second Century Ventures and our Reach (technology) accelerator program. People don’t realize this, we have over 100 technology companies of which we have an equity investment in to advance the industry. We were one of the first investors in DocuSign, for example. Now everybody does e-signatures. We have two remote notary companies that we are equity owners of. We have over 100 of those and they stand in both the residential and commercial arenas.</p>
<p>I look at the fact that we were doing this in the last 10 years and really pushed hard to make sure that Realtors had a voice in what was happening in technology. My biggest fear and I used to run this (initiative) before I became CEO for NAR, was that companies that are in the technology field—these small start-ups that had no legacy handcuffs on them are in the best position to disintermediate our members because they are just out there doing their thing. We felt that if we participated by having an equity investment in those companies that we have a chance to influence those companies so they become Realtor advocates and not Realtor adversaries. And, that is something that I think will continue… We are also one of the top technology accelerators in the world, not just in real estate, but in the world period. So, the fact that we have an opportunity with such a dominant foundation here allows us to continue to build relationships with these companies that are innovating every day and bring solutions to our members to help them improve their ROI (return on investment).</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With the recent civil unrest in Minneapolis, Kenosha and elsewhere, and with President Trump&#8217;s recent decision to repeal the affirmative further fair housing regulation, is the association undertaking any further actions to promote fair housing?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bob-Goldberg-2020-Full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33618 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bob-Goldberg-2020-Full.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="375" /></a>Goldberg:</strong> Yes, the center of the lane we play in is fair housing. I am pleased to say that even as early as January before even the mess that was occurring up in Long Island with the <em>Newsday</em> reports, we doubled down as a Leadership Team with regards to Fair Housing. President Vince (Malta) coming in, John Smaby (2019 President) last year and Charlie Oppler (2020 President-Elect) coming in, felt that we should be doing more in this arena. So, we hired a Director of Fair Housing, a gentleman named Bryan Greene. He came from HUD and was responsible for Fair Housing at HUD and we said why don’t we bring him on board with us and develop programs. This was very much pre-Long Island and was pre the situation that occurred with the unfortunate death of George Floyd. We were already saying that ‘You know what with fairness and justice, we need to be the player in housing to show what we are all about. And so, we brought Bryan on and developed the ACT (Accountability, Culture Change and Training) program, which I am sure Bryan talked to you about. (<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: HGAR held a webinar featuring NAR Director of Fair Housing Greene earlier this year) …</p>
<p>We did an Implicit Bias video, which I am very proud of as an association, which is about a 45-minute video. I think every member should be watching that. We are also asking our employees at NAR to make sure they are looking at it as well. We just converted many of our ads in our consumer ad program to Fair Housing ads. We have been running full-page ads in both the <em>New York Times</em> and Wall Street Journal about NAR’s commitment to Fair Housing. I think as you have seen with the programming we did at Leadership Summit and what we also did at the Mid-Year Legislative meetings, we have substantially increased and improved (the promotion of) more conversations and open dialogue about what we need to do in the Fair Housing arena and we have really expanded our outreach to the multi-cultural groups that are involved in housing as well and to say that we all need to do more to ensure that housing truly is fair and equitable and we as an industry need to do a better job…</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Besides COVID-19, what are the key impediments to growth in the real estate industry for the remainder of 2020 and for 2021?</p>
<p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> You know it is interesting because home sales are booming, except for the fact that the impediment, which is the lack of inventory. In the new home arena where we are a partner with the National Association of Home Builders and working very closely with them with what they are doing to help increase more housing inventory, what has happened is as we all know, lumber prices have skyrocketed, so therefore entry-level, first-time buyer homes are hard to come by. So, we keep working and pushing with them to see if there are things that can be done to increase that. With interest rates so low, which is a good thing, we have to encourage more people to feel confident that if they were to put their home up for sale in a hot market that there is an opportunity for them to move up in other homes. The problem is people don’t feel confident that if I go to sell my house, is there something affordable that I can move up to?</p>
<p>The last thing I would want to say in terms of a possible impediment is what is still going to happen with this pandemic. We are still in the heart of everything that is going on—the negatives, such as the infection rates fluctuating with rates going up in certain markets. They are talking about if there is going to be a second wave (of COVID-19). I don’t know what the definition of that is because there are some areas that are just skyrocketing in numbers while others have ebbed a bit. So, I think it is just a matter of if it turns south again and government has to go back into pulling back with greater restrictions, and some areas have done that and some have backed off on where they were before, that could be a huge impediment to the growth that we are seeing.</p>
<p>I think the good news to those impediments is that our members have been able to show, certainly since we pushed hard and worked very closely with our state associations to make sure that real estate was deemed as an essential service, that real estate can still be conducted if done safely and done the right way. Consumers demand it, our members know what to do. They don’t want to put consumers in harm’s way. So, I am hopeful that even if government were to be more restrictive again, that real estate would be left out of those restrictions because I think we as an industry have been able to show that based on the sales volume and in how busy it is, that we have been able to conduct our industry as a fair and safe haven for potential buyers and sellers… So, I think that whatever impediments are there, I think we can certainly overcome them as an industry.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Confirming what many Hudson Valley residential brokers have seen since the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, the National Association of Realtors reported that the US existing home sales market is very hot.</p>
<p>NAR reported that home sales in August were the highest in nearly 14 years (December 2006).</p>
<p>Existing-home sales continued to climb in August, marking three consecutive months of positive sales gain. Each of the four major regions experienced both month-over-month and year-over-year growth, with the Northeast seeing the greatest improvement from the prior month.</p>
<p>August existing-home sales in the Northeast jumped 13.8%, recording an annual rate of 740,000, a 5.7% increase from a year ago. The median price in the Northeast was $349,500, up 10.4% from August 2019.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, rose 2.4% from July to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6 million in August. Sales year-over-year increased 10.5% from a year ago (5.43 million in August 2019).</p>
<p>“Home sales continue to amaze, and there are plenty of buyers in the pipeline ready to enter the market,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Further gains in sales are likely for the remainder of the year, with mortgage rates hovering around 3% and with continued job recovery.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $310,600, up 11.4% from August 2019 ($278,800), as prices rose in every region. August’s national price increase marks 102 straight months of year-over-year gains.</p>
<p>Total housing inventory at the end of August totaled 1.49 million units, down 0.7% from July and down 18.6% from one year ago (1.83 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.0-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 3.1 months in July and down from the 4.0-month figure recorded in August 2019.</p>
<p>Scarce inventory has been problematic for the past few years, according to Yun, an issue he says has worsened in the past month due to the dramatic surge in lumber prices and the dearth of lumber resulting from California wildfires.</p>
<p>“Over recent months, we have seen lumber prices surge dramatically,” Yun said. “This has already led to an increase in the cost of multifamily housing and an even higher increase for single-family homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yun says the need for housing will grow even further, especially in areas that are attractive to those who can work from home. As highlighted in NAR’s August study, the 2020 “Work From Home Counties” report, remote work opportunities are likely to become a growing part of the nation’s workforce culture. Yun believes this reality will endure, even after a coronavirus vaccine is available.</p>
<p>“Housing demand is robust but supply is not, and this imbalance will inevitably harm affordability and hinder ownership opportunities,” he said. “To assure broad gains in homeownership, more new homes need to be constructed.”</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 22 days in August, seasonally equal to the number of days in July and down from 31 days in August 2019. Sixty-nine percent of homes sold in August 2020 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 33% of sales in August, down from 34% in July 2020, but up from 31% in August 2019. NAR’s 2019 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in late 2019—revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 33%.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, purchased 14% of homes in August, a small change from July’s figure of 15% and equal to the August 2019 rate of 14%. All-cash sales accounted for 18% of transactions in August, up from 16% in July 2020 and down from 19% in August 2019.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in August, equal to July’s percentage, but down from 2% in August 2019.</p>
<p>“The past few months have shown how valuable real estate is in the country, both to our nation’s economy and to individuals who have been given an opportunity to rethink their location and redesign their lifestyle,” said NAR President Vince Malta, broker at Malta &amp; Co., Inc., in San Francisco, CA. “NAR maintains robust advocacy efforts on behalf of our 1.4 million Realtors—including hundreds of thousands of housing providers—to ensure this industry can continue to lead in America’s economic recovery.”</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 2.94% in August, down from 3.02% in July. The average commitment rate across all of 2019 was 3.94%.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales sat at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.37 million in August, up 1.7% from 5.28 million in July, and up 11.0% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $315,000 in August, up 11.7% from August 2019.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 630,000 units in August, up 8.6% from July and up 6.8% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $273,300 in August, an increase of 7.8% from a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>For three straight months, home sales have climbed in every region compared to the previous month. Median home prices grew at double-digit rates in each of the four major regions from one year ago.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales increased 1.4% in the Midwest to an annual rate of 1,410,000 in August, up 9.3% from a year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $246,300, a 10.7% increase from August 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South rose 0.8% to an annual rate of 2.60 million in August, up 13.0% from the same time one year ago. The median price in the South was $269,200, a 12.3% increase from a year ago.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West inched up 0.8% to an annual rate of 1,250,000 in August, a 9.6% increase from a year ago. The median price in the West was $456,100, up 11.8% from August 201</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus and Town of Wallkill Supervisor Frank DenDanto confirmed that Orange County Dinosaur Park, LLC, which operates similar Dinosaur theme parks—“Field Station Dinosaurs” in Leonia, NJ and in Derby, KS, is looking to develop a “Dinosaur Kingdom” project on ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WALLKILL—A firm that is looking to develop and operate a Dinosaur theme park here just off Route 17 in Fair Oaks has filed applications with the Town of Wallkill and the Orange County Planning Department, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has learned.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus and Town of Wallkill Supervisor Frank DenDanto confirmed that Orange County Dinosaur Park, LLC, which operates similar Dinosaur theme parks—“Field Station Dinosaurs” in Leonia, NJ and in Derby, KS, is looking to develop a “Dinosaur Kingdom” project on 137 acres of land just off Exit 116 in the Fair Oaks section of the village.</p>
<p>Officials with Field Station Dinosaurs could not be reached for comment at press time on the proposal in Orange County.</p>
<p>Town Supervisor DenDanto stressed that the project is very early in the approval process but project representatives met via Zoom with the village’s Planning Department last month. The initial plans call for the theme park to encompass about one-third of the total parcel.</p>
<p>While the scope of the project is still to be revealed, Supervisor DenDanto said that it is smaller than the $500-million LEGOLAND New York theme park under construction less than 10 miles from the Dinosaur park proposal. The property is on Goshen Turnpike within less than a mile from the Route 17 exit and abuts Weld and Tarbell roads.</p>
<p>He said that the venture is a “multi-million-dollar project,” but the total cost will depend on a number of factors. “Depending on how they decide to fit out the park—if they use static replicas or animatronic replicas, obviously that affects the budget line substantially,” Supervisor DenDanto added. The firm’s New Jersey park uses animatronic replicas.</p>
<p>The early plans call for a substantial portion of the project remaining green. He said that RJ Smith of Rand Commercial, brought the project to the town for consideration. Ross Winglovitz, P.E., M.ACE, managing principal of engineering &amp; Surveying Properties PC of Montgomery is also working on the project. Although early in the process, the project could secure approvals as early as in a few months, the Supervisor noted.</p>
<p>The Supervisor said that the original layout of the project does not call for any rides but pathways into vignettes where patrons interact with the dinosaur replicas. A tram would be built for those that do not wish to walk the trails, he noted. The plan also calls for a Welcome Center that would have a retail component and the property would also feature an educational component.</p>
<p>“While it is really early in the formulation process, what is really exciting for us is that they came to us and we think it will be an ideal fit given how the 17-86 corridor is beginning to shape up as an entertainment/vacation destination for the Hudson Valley,” DenDanto said.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Neuhaus said that at first blush “this is an exciting project” and would complement the LEGOLAND New York theme park, which is slated to open in the spring 2021.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president and CEO of the Orange County Partnership, added, “Orange County has become very desirable for tourism destinations and with LEGOLAND just a few miles away this provides our tourists additional options.”</p>
<p>According to the company’s website, its Leonia, NJ park is closed for the 2020 season due to storm damage caused by Tropical Storm Isaias in early August. It is scheduled to reopen in May 2021.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NANUET—One of the largest residential brokerage firms in the Hudson Valley region has formed a new partnership with Howard Hanna Real Estate Services that significantly expands Howard Hanna Real Estate’s presence in Downstate New York State.</p>
<p>The deal was announced today by Marsha Rand, founder and President of Rand Realty, and Helen Hanna Casey, CEO of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, during a joint virtual meeting with their employees.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer of the newly formed Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, tells<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the partnership involved Howard Hanna Real Estate Services making an investment in Rand Realty. He stressed, however, that the Rand family maintains ownership in the company and will continue to operate the residential brokerage firm that has more than 1,000 residential real estate sales associates and operates 28 offices. The brokerage firm serves Bergen County, Passaic County, Hudson County, Morris County, and Essex County in New Jersey; as well as Rockland County, Orange County, Westchester County, Bronx, Sullivan County, Ulster County and Putnam County in New York. No further financial details on the partnership were released.</p>
<p>Rand Realty had been affiliated with Better Homes and Gardens. Howard Hanna Real Estate Services is headquartered in Pittsburgh. The full-service real estate company has 325 real estate, mortgage, insurance, title and escrow service offices across 10 states, including Allen Tate Realtors in the Carolinas, with more than 11,000 sales associates and staff.</p>

FILE PHOTO</p></div>
<p>“When I opened Rand Realty in 1984, my vision was to build a brokerage devoted to agents and homeowners alike,” said Rand. “Howard Hanna is a company that shares that mission. Because of that, and because of our shared experiences as family-owned businesses and industry innovators, I am very excited about the future of Rand Realty, now Howard Hanna | Rand Realty. By combining our expertise, we can create an even more exceptional real estate experience.”</p>
<p>Casey added, “This union brings together leading real estate industry professionals from two of the most respected and trusted family-owned companies in the business and blends them into one unified industry leader.”</p>
<p>Howard Hanna became the largest New York State brokerage after merging with Nothnagle Realtors and RealtyUSA in 2017.</p>
<p>“Howard Hanna is very excited to partner with Rand Realty and for our teams to work together to continue to do great things in New York,” said Howard W. &#8220;Hoby&#8221; Hanna, IV, president of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services. “At Howard Hanna, we’ve been on a focused growth strategy since the early 2000s. Our plan has always been to partner with like-minded brokerage firms where we believe two cultures and philosophies can mesh and blend together.”</p>
<p>He added, “As ambitious as we have been in New York State, we knew we would only enter the downstate market if we could create a partnership with the Rand company family and agents, who we have trusted and admired. This partnership will allow us to continue to expand and grow in the New York housing market, and we are very excited to welcome the Rand team and offices into the Howard Hanna family.”</p>
<p>The companies reported that Rand Realty finished 2019 with a closed sales volume of more than $2 billion and more than 6,000 homes sold in total, according to a research report produced by REAL Trends in March 2020. In New York State, Howard Hanna finished 2019 with a closed sales volume of more than $5 billion and over 29,000 homes sold in total. Howard Hanna’s total sales volume across its multiple regions totaled more than $22 billion, as well as a total of more than 100,000 houses sold, according to a research report produced by REAL Trends in March 2020.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—At a press conference staged outside the Castle Hill YMCA today, officials with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors celebrated the official merger of the two organizations.</p>
<p>Eliezer Rodriguez, CEO of the former BMNAR, officiated the festivities that included speeches by a host of Bronx dignitaries, HGAR and former BMNAR officials. The merger of BMNAR into HGAR was approved by both the BMNAR and HGAR Board of Directors, as well as the National Association of Realtors. In total, HGAR will now have nearly 1,500 members in the Bronx.</p>
<p>As a result of the merger, the Bronx Chapter of HGAR has been created and will initially operate out of the former BMNAR offices on Williamsbridge Road. Rodriguez has joined HGAR to assist with the expanded organization’s legislative advocacy agenda and the development of a stronger Commercial and Investment Division. He now serves as HGAR’s Director, Advocacy, Commercial and Legislative Issues for the Bronx and Manhattan. Vincent Buccieri, BMNAR’s 2020 President, will now serve as the Bronx regional director on HGAR’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to officially welcome the Bronx to HGAR and look forward to expanding our presence there. With its proximity to the Lower Hudson Valley, this is a natural step that will greatly benefit all of our members,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of HGAR and president and chief strategic growth officer at OneKey™, MLS.</p>
<p>In his speech to the assemblage, Haggerty related, “We have used the word ‘merger’ quite a bit today, quite frankly I do not view this as a merger. I view this as a partnership between two strong, vibrant organizations to create an even stronger, more vibrant organization that can deliver more effective services that can advocate more effectively for home ownership and private property rights.”</p>
<p>Rodriguez added, “We had been talking about this for a while, and it’s in the best interest of both the Bronx and the Hudson Valley. We can offer a lot of great political connections and expertise in the commercial real estate sector, and we will benefit by being able to provide all of our Bronx members with the resources that a larger organization can provide. It’s really a great fit for both associations.”</p>
<p>HGAR President Gail Fattizzi and HGAR President-elect Crystal Hawkins-Syska noted their Bronx roots with Fattizzi being raised in the University Heights section of the borough, while Syska’s childhood years were spent in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Both spoke of the merger’s benefits to Bronx Realtors going forward.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really exciting that your president is a Bronx girl and your president-elect is a Bronx girl,” Syska said, noting that her parents are still proud residents of the Bronx.</p>
<p>Fattizzi noted one advantage of the merger is the bridging of HGAR’s reach between Westchester and central Manhattan. “By joining our organizations together, we’ll create greater political and legislative advocacy, help with expanding our Commercial Investment Division and bring in new talent to our organization,” she said.</p>
<p>As members of HGAR, all Bronx Realtors are able to participate in OneKey™ MLS, the first regional MLS in the New York Metro area which was created by HGAR and The Long Island Board of Realtors. OneKey™ MLS currently has 42,000 subscribers.</p>

More government aid was not included for small business which has been negatively affected by COVID. House members ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The House and the Senate have passed and President Trump has signed a stopgap funding resolution through Dec. 11. This is a big step in keeping certainty going for the country and the economy at large.</p>
<p>Included in this resolution is an extension of the National Flood Insurance Program through next September, which will keep home purchases that require flood insurance more affordable. More government aid was not included for small business which has been negatively affected by COVID. House members have tried to attach repeals of the SALT cap, but that is not popular with lawmakers from low taxed states.</p>
<p>On a state level, lawmakers are considering revenue raiser enhancers to avoid draconian budget cuts. The MTA needs $12 billion from the federal government or commuter rail service west of the Hudson could be shut down. Metro North and the Long Island Rail Road could lose half of its current service.</p>
<p>One of the revenue raisers being promoted for the New York City area is a pied a terre tax which would primarily hit the affluent people who maintain an apartment in New York City. This could theoretically generate significant revenue, however, the downside result could be the abandonment of New York City by the owners of these apartments.</p>
<p>On a local level, the Human Rights Commission of Westchester County reported that only two fines have gone out to co-op apartment boards so far under the county co-op law. According to the FOIL request that HGAR submitted to Westchester County there have been at least 278 rejections and likely well over 300 at this point.</p>
<p>The commission made several recommendations, one of which was requiring a uniform application for all co-ops to use. Legislators generally support a reason in writing stating why a prospective purchaser, or renter is being denied from the co-op. Stay tuned for updates.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Botsoe, who has more than 30 years real estate experience, made history three years ago when she became the first African American president of the more than century-old Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The New York State Association of Realtors announced today at its 2020 Virtual Fall Business Meetings that veteran Westchester Realtor Dorothy Botsoe, Broker/Owner of Dorothy Jensen Realty, Inc. of White Plains, has been named NYSAR 2020 Realtor of the Year.</p>
<p>Botsoe, who has more than 30 years real estate experience, made history three years ago when she became the first African American president of the more than century-old Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>During her HGAR presidency in 2017, she also made history by doing something that no other president had ever done in the past—personally reaching out to HGAR’s then 11,000 Realtors with her “Tea with the President” series. She traveled through all four counties—Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange, as well as the Bronx—to meet with Realtors and listen to their concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>Botsoe said being named the 2020 NYSAR Realtor of the Year is an “overwhelming honor.”</p>
<p>“It’s amazing that my peers think I’m so deserving of such consideration,” she said. “I never think about an award – it’s always about service and advocating for consumers and other Realtors. I do it selflessly, because at the end of the day, it’s about what’s in the best interest of the consumer and the real estate industry.”</p>
<p>Botsoe’s involvement with NYSAR began more than 20 years ago and since then she’s served more than 150 times on various committees, such as the Housing Opportunities Foundation, Legislative Policy Forum and Education Management Committee.</p>
<p>A native of Ghana, West Africa, Botsoe opened her own brokerage in 1995, specializing in all aspects of real estate including sales, leasing and real estate owned/foreclosure specific work. She holds a B.A. in Business Administration from SUNY Purchase.</p>
<p>Her accomplishments and positions include honors such as the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Realtor of the Year (2012), the New York State Women’s Council of Realtors Member of the Year (2007), the New York State Chapter of Women’s Council of Realtors President (2003) and New York State Graduate Realtor Institute Chapter President (2003). She has served on the board for the Women’s Council of Realtors as Governor, Treasurer and President at both the local and state levels. She also served as Second Vice President and Director for the former Westchester County Board of Realtors and has also served on the National Association of Realtors Board of Directors and its Diversity Committee.</p>
<p>At HGAR, Botsoe currently serves on the Board of Directors, the Fair Housing Task Force and the Legislative Council and the Global Business Council. Last year she co-chaired HGAR’s Fair Housing &amp; Cultural Diversity Committee.</p>
<p>She has been an avid supporter of RPAC and has continuously been listed in HGAR’s “RPAC Honor Roll,” donating more than $10,000 to RPAC annually. She has also been inducted into NYSAR’s “RPAC Hall of Fame” and is always a staple at NYSAR’s Lobby Day in Albany.</p>
<p>Two years ago, she co-chaired HGAR’s RPAC Committee, while also serving as the Immediate Past President of HGAR. Among the events she created and organized for RPAC were Zumba Fitness, Realtor Olympics, a visit to the Culinary Institute of American and many other Networking events.</p>
<p>In addition, Botsoe was honored by the Westchester Residential Opportunities (WRO) in 2017 for her tireless work for the full-service housing counseling organization that helps families and individuals in Westchester and the lower Hudson Valley by educating first-time homebuyers. She served on WRO’s Board of Directors for two years and is currently a member of its Diversity Committee.</p>
<p>NYSAR also gave special recognition at the Virtual Fall Business Meetings to  significant contributors to the Realtor Political Action Committee, including HGAR members Michael Schmelzer of Tryax Realty Management Inc. for his $150,000 contribution and Dorothy Botsoe, Nancy Kennedy and HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty for their $50,000 contributions to RPAC.</p>
<p>The most recent HGAR members to have been named NYSAR Realtor of the Year honor include J.P. Endres in 2010, the late Henry Fries in 2006 and Savo Fries in 2004.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><em>Editor’s Note: The following is the full text version of the<strong><a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2020/10/OneKey-MLS-3rd-Qtr-2020-Real-Estate-Market-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2020 Third Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report </a></strong>Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx Counties, New York released on Oct. 5 by OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC.</em></p>
<p>WHITE PLAINS—After experiencing solid first quarter sales, real estate practitioners in the lower Hudson Valley region, served by OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC, were prepared for an active second quarter developing new inventory and accommodating high buyer interest, both earmarks of second quarter activity. Instead, COVID-19 happened, and the market came to an abrupt halt with real estate agents unable to show properties and were confined to virtual interactions with buyers and sellers. Resiliency, creativity, and technology all began to replace shock and practitioners soon learned to navigate their new environment resulting in historically high single-family residential third quarter sales figures. The optimism is back.</p>
<p>Single-family residential sales figures increased across the board throughout the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area with the exception of Bronx County, which likely felt the impact of the hard-hit New York City market. Sullivan County experienced a 45% increase in sales over the third quarter of 2019 with 384 single-family residential units sold compared to 264 units in 2019. Westchester County, the largest county in the region, saw single family residential sales increase from 1,940 in 2019 to 2,173 in 2020, a 12% gain. The single-family residential sales gain in Putnam was 8.4%, 350 sales compared to 323 in 2019; third quarter sales in Rockland were up 4.8% to 674 units compared to Q3, 2019 when 643 sales took place. Orange County sales were up 7.9%. There were 1,190 sales in Orange as compared to 1,103 sales in 2019, Q3.</p>
<p>Median sale prices of single-family homes were up in all counties including the Bronx despite a decrease in sales in that borough. Sullivan County had the highest percentage increase at 33.1% ($197,550 up from $148,450 in 2019). The median sale price in Westchester increased 15.9% to $810,000 from $699,00 (Q3, 2019), the Orange County median was up 14.6% to $330,000 from $288,000 in the third quarter of 2019, Rockland’s median increased 7.4% to $510,000 (from $475,000) and Putnam County’s median rose 9.7% to $411,250 from $375,000 in 2019.</p>
<p>A concerning number in Westchester County is the eroding state of co-op sales, which have decreased for several quarters and were down 25.7% in the third quarter as compared to third quarter 2019. Units sold in the third quarter were 339 versus 456 in 2019. There was no concomitant drop in price however. The same has held true for Bronx County where sales of co-ops decreased 35.5% and have been decreasing over several quarters. The price of a co-op in Bronx County increased 8% to $237,500. Co-ops do not represent a significant part of the market in the other counties served by OneKey MLS LLC.</p>
<p>Condominium sales were down in all counties with the exception of Putnam County where “condo” sales were up 28% to 50 units from 39 in third quarter, 2019. Ironically, condominium prices increased in all counties except Putnam.</p>
<p>Multi-family sales were down across the board leading to speculation that some of these decreases, both condo and multi-family, may be more a function of COVID-19-related issues than lack of buyers and/or interest. The weakness in the condo, co-op and multi-family sectors took a toll on overall sales figures with Westchester County’s total residential sales down 1.3% to 2,949 units compared to 2,988 units in 2019, Q3 and Bronx sales down 29.6%.</p>
<p>Other counties having less significant condo and co-op markets fared better in the quarter. Putnam County registered an overall increase of 8.6% total residential sales, Orange County sales were up 4.6%, Rockland’s rose 2.2% and Sullivan County with a virtually non-existent condo or co-op inventory was still up 42.2%.</p>
<p>Lack of inventory continues to hamper sales in all residential categories. Recently listing activity has increased as buyers become more comfortable with the measures in place to protect them from exposure to the COVID-19 virus as well as the vibrancy of the market. It is difficult to predict market conditions going forward. In the short term, the market remains strong with the number of properties in contract being exceptionally high at this point of the year. These contracts should represent closed sales before year’s end. Interest rates remain at historic lows, which contributes to affordability. There is also the migration to the suburbs, which is currently a factor and has created huge demand. What is difficult to evaluate, however, is how long a complete economic recovery will take and how that will impact the market going forward?</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Small Business Administration will begin processing PPP loan forgiveness applications. Businesses’ are eligible for the forgiveness program if they spent 60% or more of the loan on payroll, and for other uses such as rent, electric or mortgage payments. The PPP program saved many businesses from going under. Businesses should submit their applications to the small business lender they worked with to obtain the loan.</p>
<p>The second update has to do with the National Flood Insurance Program. Congress has reauthorized the program for one year. This will help to ensure that homes that require flood insurance can receive financing allowing for the sale of the home. NAR President Vince Malta stated, “NAR thanks lawmakers for including a one-year extension of the National Flood Insurance Program in this Continuing Resolution, but the job is not done.” Malta, a broker at Malta &amp; Co., Inc., in San Francisco, CA. went on to say, “As the 116th Congress nears its end, the House and Senate are missing a golden, bipartisan opportunity to move meaningful NFIP reform legislation authored by Chairwoman Maxine Waters and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry, which addresses the program’s viability and affordability. NAR urges Congress to make long-term reform a priority moving forward.” A five-year reauthorization would be the best thing long term for the program’s viability, but the one-year extension is better than a short term one.</p>
<p>Finally, Congress has still not approved aid for state and local governments. This will hold back the recovery as government workers will be laid off, or furloughed due to a shortage of funding. Congress must come to a deal, in order to avert a deeper economic meltdown. Vital services, such as trash collection, for instance, are now being reduced in New York City because of this.</p>
<p>The state must also resist any increase in transfer taxes. New York has the highest real estate taxes in the country. Any increase will further erode New York’s tax base. Stay tuned for updates.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Sept. 30, U.S. District Court Judge Eric R. Komitee for the Eastern District of New York, issued a decision that deals a temporary blow to two cases filed more than a year ago by the Community Housing Improvement Program and the Rent Stabilization Association of N.Y.C., in one case, and several landlords, in another [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3jPJKzp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3jPJKzp</a>] (collectively, “<em>CHIP</em>”), in opposition to the Statewide Housing Security and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (the “2019 Act” or “Act”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2xA6lth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2xA6lth</a>] passed on June 14, 2019.</p>
<p>Since the cases involved similar issues the court issued one decision addressing both actions. In light of this decision, it is likely that the Plaintiffs will appeal the decision. The court addressed, among others, two major constitutional issues: (1) whether the 2019 Act resulted in an unconstitutional “taking;” and (2) whether it violated the “Contracts” clause contained in Article I of U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Provisions Highlighted by the Court</strong></p>
<p>In the Opinion, Judge Komitee highlights some of the more “notable” provisions of the 2019 Act:</p>
<p>• “Cap the number of units landlords can recover for personal use at one unit per building (and only upon a showing of immediate and compelling necessity).” N.Y. Reg. Sess. § 6458, Part I (2019).</p>
<p>• Repeal the “luxury decontrol” provisions, which allowed landlords, in certain circumstances, to decontrol a unit when the rent reached a specified value. Id. at Part D, § 5.</p>
<p>• Repeal the “vacancy” and “longevity” increase provisions, which allowed landlords to charge higher rents when certain units became vacant. Id. at Part B, §§ 1, 2.</p>
<p>• Repeal the “preferential rate” provisions, which allowed landlords who had been charging rates below the legal maximum to increase those rates when a lease ended. Id. at Part E.</p>
<p>• Reduce the value of capital improvements — called “individual apartment improvements” (IAI) and “major capital improvements” (MCI) — that landlords may pass on to tenants through rent increases. Id. at Part K, §§ 1, 2, 4, 11.</p>
<p>• Increase the fraction of tenant consent needed to convert a building to cooperative or condominium use. Id. at Part N.</p>
<p>• Extend, from six to 12 months, the period in which state housing courts may stay the eviction of breaching tenants. Id. at Part M, § 21.”</p>
<p>It is important to note that the 2019 Act “repealed” many of the provisions which, under original rent regulations passed decades ago, were set to expire at a finite point in the future. In a previous article [see <a href="https://bit.ly/34NCP3r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/34NCP3r</a>], it has been noted that the rent stabilization and rent regulation laws were not intended to go on in perpetuity. Yet, under the 2019 Act, critical provisions of the New York Rent Regulation laws were extended in perpetuity. This is something that not only contradicts the original intent of previous rental regulations, it provided no notice to property owners about the rights that were being stripped from them. In April, a New York State Supreme Court decision in <em>Regina Metropolitan Co., LLC v. New York State Division of Housing and Community Preservation (“Regina Metropolitan”)</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/38I4y79" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/38I4y79</a>], not only barred the retroactive applicability of the 2019 Act, but also potentially laid the ground work that could ultimately provide a basis for a challenge regarding the constitutionality of parts of the Act.</p>
<p>The rent regulation laws were passed many years ago to address housing shortages that existed immediately following World War II. In 1969, the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (“RSL”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3iCns3U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3iCns3U</a>] was passed in New York City. In 1974, New York State also passed the Emergency Tenant Protection Act. These laws were enacted to further address housing shortages and issues that existed at that time. However, none of these previous regulations were enacted to remain in effect in perpetuity, and in fact, they were passed with the requirement that there be a periodic reassessment of whether these rent regulation laws were still necessary. The New York Supreme Court in Regina Metropolitan pointed out that the legislature did not provide a rationale for many of the provisions passed under the 2019 Act.</p>
<p><strong>The 2019 Act and The Constitutional “Takings” Clause</strong></p>
<p>Judge Komitee states in his Opinion that “[w]hen a government authorizes ‘a permanent physical occupation” of property, a taking occurs [citations omitted].” He further states that “[p]hysical takings are characterized by a deprivation of the ‘entire bundle of property rights’ in the affected property interest—‘the rights to possess, use and dispose of’ it.” Under the 2019 Act, the “luxury decontrol” provision, the “vacancy” and “longevity” increase provisions, and the “preferential rate” provisions were all repealed completely, not reasonably extended or modified. While the judge in CHIP, in his opinion, believes that the 2019 Act did not take away an entire “bundle” of rights from owners, it clearly did not simply deprive owners of a singular strand. In fact, the Act stripped owners of a significant and sizeable “bundle” of real property rights.</p>
<p><strong>The 3-Factor Test Used in Determining a ‘Constitutional Taking?’</strong></p>
<p>The Opinion in <em>CHIP</em> indicates that “[e]ven without rendering property worthless, a regulatory scheme may still effectuate a taking if it ‘goes too far,’ in Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.’s words. [citation omitted].” As pointed out by Judge Komitee, “[i]n the current era, courts apply the three-factor test to determine whether a regulation that works a less than-total destruction of value has gone too far. The factors are: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action in question.” [See <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City</em> (U.S. Supreme Court, 1978) at <a href="https://bit.ly/3jTgFDe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3jTgFDe</a>]. These factors must be analyzed in order to determine whether or not a plaintiff has been deprived of property without just compensation or due process.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 1: Economic Impact</strong></p>
<p>According to Judge Komitee, the “economic impact” against the plaintiffs “…needs to be calculated on an owner-by-owner basis, and those calculations will vary significantly depending on when a property was purchased, what fraction of its units are rent stabilized, what improvements the landlord has made, and many other metrics.” The judge stated that “[a]t best, Plaintiffs can make vague allegations about the average diminution in value across regulated properties.” Since, its passage, the 2019 Act has clearly had a significant impact on property values and the “vague allegations” referred to in the Opinion, at the very least warrant the presentment of evidence at trial. A summary determination that there is no economic impact is not only vague, it contradicts the clear evidence in the market to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 2: Interference with Investment-Backed Expectations</strong></p>
<p>The second factor deals with the extent to which enacted regulations “…interfere with reasonable investment-backed expectations.” Judge Komitee, citing a Second Circuit Court of Appeals case [see <em>Allen v. Cuomo</em> (U.S. Ct. App 2d. Cir, 1996) at <a href="https://bit.ly/3lFwjm0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3lFwjm0</a>], indicates that “…the nature of each landlord’s investment-backed expectations depends on when they invested in the property and what they expected at that time.” It is clear that each of these plaintiffs invested in and purchased their properties prior to the enactment of the 2019 Act and it is safe to assume that none of their expectations included a substantial diminution in property rights and investment expectations. For example, where a landlord was able to reasonably increase rental rates and recoup capital investments, these rights and benefits have been severely restricted, if not altogether eradicated by the 2019 Act.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 3: The Character and Magnitude of the Regulatory Taking</strong></p>
<p>The third factor focuses on “…the character of the governmental action in question.” Judge Komitee citing <em>Penn Central</em>, explains that “[a] taking may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.” Judge Komitee, however, goes on to quote language from another notable U.S. Supreme Court case [see <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</em> (2005) at <a href="https://bit.ly/3iTexK8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3iTexK8</a>], which provided that “…the <em>Penn Central</em> inquiry turns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation’s economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests…,” and then relying on this language, dismissed the plaintiffs’ regulatory-takings claim. Again, a plain reading of the Penn Central 3-factor test and the above language, it is not clear how a dismissal could be warranted without permitting the plaintiffs to establish the “magnitude” of the impact of the 2019 Act on their property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Did the 2019 Act Violate the ‘Contracts’ Clause of the Constitution?</strong></p>
<p>Under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, States are prohibited from “pass[ing] any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts….” In analyzing a claim under the “Contracts Clause”, a Court “…must ask three questions: ‘(1) is the contractual impairment substantial and, if so, (2) does the law serve a legitimate public purpose such as remedy a general social or economic problem and, if such purpose is demonstrated, (3) are the means chosen to accomplish this purpose reasonable and necessary[?].’” Judge Komitee indicated that one of the plaintiffs, 74 Pinehurst LLC, “…adequately allege[d] that the 2019 amendments ‘substantially impair’ its executed leases by affecting a critical term of their executed lease agreements — the monthly rent.” However, the court summarily determined that the plaintiff did not satisfy the second and third questions and dismissed the Contracts Clause claim.</p>
<p>Again, there was not much analysis offered as to why the second and third questions were not answered, especially where there was no hearing held to allow those prongs to be addressed. As pointed out in <em>Regina Metropolitan</em>, there were many concerns as to whether the legislature established that these new laws “served a legitimate public purpose”, and whether the means were “reasonable and necessary.” It seems that the court in <em>CHIP</em> also failed to address these critical issues.</p>
<p><strong>The Fight is Far from Over</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that the fight against the 2019 Act is not over. The appeal process will be crucial in determining whether the plaintiffs will be successful in overturning all or portions of the 2019 Act. We must now wait to see how the lawsuits filed in both federal and state courts will proceed through the appellate process. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, property values and rental markets throughout New York State, and particularly in New York City, were dramatically and negatively impacted by the 2019 Act. The pandemic has only exacerbated these effects. The Act, passed to afford tenants added protections, has had the opposite effect. Landlords have drastically cut capital improvements and have also decided to keep many rental units off the market. Rather than increase the availability of housing, the 2019 Act has only reduced the amount of affordable (and renovated) housing units made available to tenants.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Previously adopted by the Department of State, the changes to the advertising guidelines will take effect on November 2, 2020.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So much is happening today. We’re all riding a big surge in real estate activity and we’re all surprisingly busy this fall. There are all sorts of new COVID-19 protocols, Executive Orders and recent rollbacks of permissible real estate activity in various regions and new fair housing requirements. As a result, it’s easy for some things to fall through the cracks and be overlooked. That’s why this month’s article will update everyone on a few things that otherwise might have gone overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Advertising Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Previously adopted by the Department of State, the <strong>changes to the advertising guidelines will take effect on Nov. 2, 2020</strong>. The following is a link to the DOS website that provides the full regulations, guidance, and checklist: <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/re_advertising/re_advertising.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/re_advertising/re_advertising.html</a>.</p>
<p>The new changes focus primarily on properly identifying listing brokers and their listings. The new regulations also expand the scope of application. For starters, Section 175.25(d)(3)(ii) of the regulations was revised to require the new rules and regulations to apply to every page of a website, <strong>including any page that displays multiple properties or property search results</strong>. This means that proper disclosures must be provided on any page that displays properties or search results, <strong>including all IDX feeds</strong>. In addition, a link to the broker or brokerage website with whom the licensee or team is associated will be required to be on the homepage of the website, unless the broker or brokerage does not have a website.</p>
<p>However, the most significant changes to the advertising regulations included the addition of subsections (i) and (ii) to Section 175.25(d)(6). Section (i) states:</p>
<p>No real estate broker, associate real estate broker, or real estate salesperson shall advertise in any manner or make reference to in any advertisement property that is subject to an exclusive listing agreement of another broker, <strong>without authorization from the exclusive listing broker</strong>. Such advertisements must <em>clearly and conspicuously disclose the name of the exclusive listing broker immediately after one of the following phrases:</em></p>
<p><em>“Listing Provided by [insert name of the exclusive listing broker],”</em><br />
“Listing by [insert name of exclusive listing broker],”<br />
“Listing Broker Contact [insert name of exclusive listing broker],”<br />
“Listing of [insert name of exclusive listing broker],”<br />
“Listing Provided Courtesy of [insert name of exclusive listing broker],”<br />
“Listing Courtesy of [insert name of exclusive listing broker],” or<br />
“Listing Agent Contact [insert name of exclusive listing broker].”</p>
<p>The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the listing broker is clearly identified and consumers are directed to the broker who actually has the listing. NYSAR has indicated that “clearly and conspicuously” means “above the fold,” so if you have to scroll down to find the information, it is not clear and conspicuous. This provision applies to all websites, social media posts, print ads, etc.</p>
<p>Subsection (ii) of the regulations further provides that:</p>
<p>Any real estate broker, associate real estate broker, or real estate salesperson that pays a third-party for advertising involving a property that is subject to an exclusive listing agreement of another broker must, in addition to the requirements in subparagraph (i), include in any advertisement that provides the advertising broker’s <em>name words to disclose that the advertisement</em> is a paid advertisement using at a minimum the word “<strong>advertisement”</strong> immediately following the real estate broker, associate real estate broker, or real estate salesperson’s name.</p>
<p>This provision requires that licensees are responsible to ensure that properties that are advertised on third-party websites or portals (i.e. Zillow, StreetEasy, etc.) comply with this rule. Failure to ensure that these rules are followed can subject the licensee to discipline. Again, the “clear and conspicuous” requirement applies to these types of advertisements, and in addition to complying with disclosure of the listing broker information as provided for in subsection (i), a broker must also include words that indicate it is a paid “advertisement.”</p>
<p><strong>Landlord Rent Regulation Litigation</strong></p>
<p>In January 2020, the Department of State provided guidance relating to the Statewide Housing Security &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019 and the Housing Stability &amp; Tenant Protection Act of 2019. (most Realtors refer to these acts as the new “Rent Regulations” or “Rent Guidelines”). The DOS guidance indicated that landlords could not seek to collect a “Broker Fee” from a prospective tenant, which ran contrary to many real estate practices, especially in New York City. As a result, NYSAR, REBNY and other brokerages filed a lawsuit and obtained a temporary restraining order. After numerous extensions by the state, Respondents submitted opposition papers on Sept. 11, 2020. Oral arguments have yet to be scheduled. Until such time that the court hears and rules on this matter, the temporary restraining order shall remain in effect and <strong>a landlord may still require prospective tenants to pay a “Broker Fee” for renting a property.</strong></p>
<p><strong>OneKey Amends Clear Cooperation Rule</strong></p>
<p>Recently, the Board of Managers for OneKey MLS met and a modification to the Clear Cooperation rule was made. Below is the rule with the noted changes in<em> italics:</em></p>
<p>302.2 NAR Clear Cooperation Policy &#8211;<strong>Effective May 1, 2020</strong><br />
a. Within one (1) business day of marketing a property to the public, the listing broker must submit the listing to the MLS for cooperation with other MLS participants. Public marketing includes, but is not limited to, flyers displayed in windows, yard signs, digital marketing on public facing websites, brokerage website displays (including IDX and VOW), digital communications marketing (email blasts), multi-brokerage listing sharing networks and applications available to the general public.</p>
<p><strong>(NAR Mandatory Statement 8, Updated 11/11/19).</strong></p>
<p><em>b. Commercial, nonresidential, properties are not subject to this rule.</em><br />
<em> c. All residential property classes are subject to this rule, including the following:</em><br />
<em> (1) residential 1-4 family homes (but not residential properties with 5 or more units),</em><br />
<em> (2) residential cooperative apartments, condominiums, units in a home owner’s association (HOA), townhouses, and mobile homes,</em><br />
<em> (3) residential rentals, and</em><br />
<em> (4) vacant land that is zoned only for residential development.</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that commercial/nonresidential properties and residential properties with five or more units are not subject to the Clear Cooperation rule; however, all other land uses, including co-ops, condos, HOAs, residential vacant land and <strong>rentals</strong> are subject to the rule.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Realtors, like jugglers, need to keep a lot of balls in the air. One slip in concentration and all the balls fall to the ground. In addition to your brokerage and colleagues, you have at your fingertips many sources for keeping track of news and information. These include articles and updates from NYSAR, NAR, HGAR, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> reporting, OneKey and myself. All of these resources can and should be used to help you keep juggling. Make sure you avail yourself of all of these resources to keep you up to date and in compliance with all the new rules, regulations and laws.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s been more than six months since the onslaught of COVID, and many Westchester businesses have closed or are still floundering. But perhaps one of the industries hit hardest by the pandemic has been tourism.</p>
<p>After 47 years in operation, the renowned Westchester Hilton in Rye closed its doors in July. With 445 guest rooms, 19 meeting rooms and 33,000 square feet of event space, the hotel had played host to celebrities and even former U.S. presidents over the years.</p>
<div id="attachment_33955" style="width: 261px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RITZ-CARLTON-WHITE-PLAINS.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33955" class=" wp-image-33955" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RITZ-CARLTON-WHITE-PLAINS.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33955" class="wp-caption-text">The Ritz-Cartlon Westchester in White Plains</p></div>
<p>Earlier this year, the Doral Arrowood in Rye Brook ceased operations after 37 years in business. The 114-acre campus offered 400 rooms, three restaurants, plus golf and tennis courts. Tarrytown’s Castle Hotel &amp; Spa, along with the Ritz-Carlton in White Plains, closed temporarily for renovations and are planning re-openings in 2021.</p>
<p>“All of our hotels have been affected by the pandemic,” acknowledged Natasha Caputo, director, Westchester County Tourism &amp; Film. “Here in Westchester, business travelers represent the biggest market, and with so many states still listed on New York’s COVID travel advisory list, there’s been a huge decline in this market.”</p>
<p>Social events and weddings have also seen a marked decrease. “Westchester is a destination for so many weddings because of all that we have to offer here, but hotels must adhere to New York State guidelines for maximum capacities,” Caputo added.</p>
<p>In the pre-pandemic era, Westchester’s tourism industry was booming. A recent report from the Westchester County Tourism &amp; Film office indicated the county’s $2-billion tourism industry reached record levels in 2018. Hotel activity was up by 8%, with occupancy rising to 73.8%. The report also showed that travel and tourism continued to be a significant driver of the county’s economy. Local and state taxes generated by the industry came in at $233 million at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>This January, Westchester County launched a new tourism campaign called “Beyond,” aimed at attracting new visitors for a destination getaway. Just two months later, though, the pandemic put a temporary halt to those plans.</p>
<div id="attachment_33956" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Abby-Inn-Spa.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33956" class=" wp-image-33956" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Abby-Inn-Spa.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33956" class="wp-caption-text">The Spa at The Abbey Inn, Peekskill</p></div>
<p>Still, there has been some unexpected good news on the horizon, even during these challenging times. The 153-room SpringHill Suites by Marriott opened this summer in Tuckahoe. Earlier this year, the much-anticipated Abbey Inn &amp; Spa opened in Peekskill, sitting on 65 acres overlooking the Hudson River. The luxury hotel offers 42 rooms, a farm-to-table restaurant and a spa. Constructed in 1872, it originally served as a convent and chapel for the Episcopal Sisters of Saint Mary.</p>
<p>“We actually opened in mid-March, just as the pandemic was hitting our region,” said Gilbert Baeriswil, General Manager. “I guess the timing wasn’t great, but who could have predicted anything like this.”</p>
<p>Some of the facility’s first guests were first responders serving the area, who were offered discounted rooms. However, by mid-May, when the weather began to change, the Inn started to see an in influx of people from New York City, looking for a quick and easy getaway. “Given the situation, business has far exceeded our expectations,” said Baeriswil.</p>
<p>The Inn’s courtyard was quickly adapted for outdoor dining to supplement the 50% occupancy requirements for their restaurant. “We’re going to stretch the outdoor dining for as long as we can,” added Baeriswil.</p>
<p>While there were employee layoffs shortly after opening, most of them are now back. The spa recently opened, with all employees wearing face shields and all treatment rooms sanitized with ultraviolet light following each treatment. Spa customers are also required to have their temperatures taken prior to their massage or facial.</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate in that we are a smaller, boutique hotel located on a large piece of property with walking trails,” said Baeriswil. “It’s a big attraction for people from New York City, the lower Hudson Valley and Connecticut—especially because we are so close to Bear Mountain and other Hudson Valley attractions.”</p>
<p>The Inn’s largest ballroom can accommodate up to 120 people for weddings or other events, but is now limited to the maximum number of 50 people. A smaller meeting room, which is the former chapel, normally holds up to 50 people, but now only 25.</p>
<div id="attachment_33958" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WC-Marriott-Grand-Ballroom.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33958" class="wp-image-33958" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WC-Marriott-Grand-Ballroom.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="236" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33958" class="wp-caption-text">The new Grand Ballroom at the Westchester Marriott in Tarrytown</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Terry McAneney, General Manager of the Westchester Marriott in Tarrytown, has been working with the County Office of Tourism &amp; Film to re-purpose the hotel during the pandemic as a filming venue for movies, television shows or commercials. Producers of the popular NBC series, “The Blacklist,” recently used the hotel’s lobby, guest rooms and pool for various scenes.</p>
<p>“The hotel is in a great location—right off I-287, and we have over 900 parking spaces, which is perfect for production companies,” said McAneney. “We want to make it easy for people to do busines with us, and our ballroom has its own entrance so people and equipment can move in and out without having to go through the lobby.”</p>
<p>Last year, the hotel took on the task of modernizing its 10,000-square-foot ballroom, adding new carpeting, painting, wallpaper and lighting. While it can now seat up to 1,000 people, the ballroom is limited to only 50, due to COVID social distancing restrictions. “Yes, this has hurt us,” admitted McAneney. “People are not traveling for business and most have postponed weddings or other social events. And now with the list of quarantined states growing, it could be quite some time before things start to get back to normal.”</p>
<p>Some of their employees have been furloughed and the hotel’s restaurant and pool remain closed. The fitness center is open at one-third capacity and Ruth’s Chris Steak House, attached to the hotel, is open every day. “We’re working hard to keep our doors open, and we have seen an uptick in weekend visits from local residents who just want to get out of the house for a change,” added McAneney.</p>
<p>Kevin Johnson, general manger of the DoubleTree by Hilton in Tarrytown, echoes McAneney’s concerns. The DoubleTree’s Grand Ballroom also offers 10,000 square feet of space, most of which has remained empty since the pandemic began. “Very few people want to have a wedding with just 50 guests, so a lot of people have just cancelled their plans,” he said. “Some have opted for simple weddings with a Justice of the Peace, and others have reserved venues in states that allow larger gatherings.”</p>
<p>Like so many other area hotels, the DoubleTree has been forced to lay off employees, but Johnson hoped that he’ll be able to bring them back soon. “We’ve been doing some smaller corporate events and we’re just working with what we have for now,” he said. The hotel’s leisure travel market has picked up slightly with people in the New York metro area looking for a quick weekend getaway.</p>
<p>Normally during October, the hotel is completely booked with travelers from out-of-state visiting the Hudson Valley and all of the Halloween events in Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow.</p>
<p>“However, this year, even the special events have been forced to limit the number of people attending, and none of the tour buses are operating now,” he said.</p>
<p>The hotel’s restaurant, Bistro Z, remains open and its spacious outdoor patio is helping to keep business going. They plan to invest in heat lamps for the cooler weather ahead. Inside, the 75-seat restaurant now offers only 30 socially-distanced seats.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, Westchester may be faring a bit better than hotels on a national level. A recent survey of American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association (AHLA) members shows that the hotel industry remains on the brink of collapse due to the pandemic. Results indicate 68% of hotels have less than half of their typical, pre-crisis staff working full time.</p>
<p>Almost half of those surveyed also fear they are in danger of foreclosure by their commercial real estate lenders, and more than two-thirds report they may be able to last only another six months at the current projected revenue and occupancy levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the AHLA has initiated “Save Hotel Jobs,” a grassroots program for hoteliers across the country, urging lawmakers to pass additional stimulus relief. “Every Member of Congress needs to hear from us about the urgent need for additional support so that we can keep our doors open and bring back our employees,” said Chip Rogers, AHLA President and CEO. Rogers said the hotel and lodging industry contributes nearly $660 billion to the U.S. GDP.</p>
<p>Early this month, another ALHA survey found that nine in 10 American voters support Congress passing another COVID relief bill to help distressed businesses. In fact, 50% selected travel and tourism as the top two most affected industries.</p>
<p>Beginning this Fall, the Tourism &amp; Film office initiated “Westchester With Care,” a program enlisting area businesses and non-profits to help fight COVID-19 and safeguard the health and well-being of all who live, work and visit in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Participating businesses are asked to take an online pledge to follow CDC and New York State Department of Health guidelines for cleaning, providing employees with training in sanitizing best practices, monitoring employees for COVID, using protective equipment and face coverings, reducing capacities and maintaining social distancing.</p>
<p>“The rebound process for the tourism will be slow and steady,” acknowledged Caputo. “When full travel is ready again, we have the space here in Westchester, and our hotels will be able to accommodate social distancing in comfortable and appealing settings.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Hudson Valley’s real estate market and overall economy,<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> this month turned to a veteran real estate executive— Martin Ginsburg—who has for 57 years thrived in boom times and survived a number of major real estate downturns and deep recessions for some much needed perspective.</p>
<p>The 85-year old affable founder and principal of Ginsburg Development Companies has developed more than 10,000 housing units, mostly in the New York metro region, including Westchester, Rockland and Orange counties. The Valhalla-based company, prior to the Great Recession, mostly focused on condominium developments and built such notable successful and prestigious luxury developments, including: Boulder Ridge, Pondside, Mystic Pointe, Marbury Corners, Christie Place, The Fairways at Wallkill, Harbors at Haverstraw, Quaker Green and Gillette Ridge.</p>
<p>Some of its notable completed rental apartment projects and developments in progress include: River Tides, 1177 and Stratus in the Greystone neighborhood of Yonkers, The Lofts in Hastings-on-Hudson, Harbor Square in Ossining and Fort Hill Apartments in Peekskill, The Metro in Downtown White Plains and The Landing in Mohegan Lake. In 2020 the readers of <em>Westchester Magazine</em> voted GDC as “Westchester’s Best Luxury Apartment Developer.”</p>
<p>In response to the market forces after the Great Recession, GDC, whose motto is “Always with Integrity” has concentrated on rental housing development almost exclusively. The company began operations in the early 1960s in Tuckahoe and currently makes its home in Valhalla.<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GINSBURG_0299.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34001 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GINSBURG_0299.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s find out his views on the rental housing market today and the market forces that he believes will drive activity post COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: What is the state of the rental apartment market in Westchester County and is the influx of New York City residents to the county driving leasing volume?</p>
<p><strong>Ginsburg:</strong> I would say we are definitely seeing people coming out of New York City. We always had a flow of people coming out of New York City, particularly in our Yonkers apartments. I would say, however, that we are busy seeing people from New York City (Manhattan and Brooklyn) in our Peekskill property (Fort Hill).</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Has this exodus trend from New York City prompted GDC to invest in additional projects in Westchester and other Hudson Valley counties, and if so, where?</p>
<p><strong>Ginsburg:</strong> We are active in Rockland County in Haverstraw (Harbors at Haverstraw) and we have been there a long time. We are starting a new 252-apartment project there. We just completed 536 units (apartments, condominiums and townhomes) and we are leasing the last part of the Harbors project there. We have very strong activity there from New York. This is very high-end, on the water apartments.</p>
<p><em>Editor’s Note: Ginsburg then discussed one of his more high-profile developments, the redevelopment of the former Westchester Financial Center in Downtown White Plains into the mixed-use City Square development.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ginsburg-Groundbreaking_photo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34002 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ginsburg-Groundbreaking_photo.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="267" /></a>We are leasing the offices and we are building the (188) apartments, which were converted from where Pace University had their school… We are keeping part of the offices—the top three floors are going to be retained as penthouse offices with their own entrance, which is what it was before. And then we are doing a pretty unique residential development there with a strong art focus. It is going to be a real atelier type of approach with high ceilings and we are going to expose the concrete and duct work. A very New York City type design that you might see on the Lower East Side. There aren’t too many things like that in Westchester, a very art-focused (project). Every apartment is going to have its own gallery. I think we will be marketing (the property) in the spring and we may even start earlier. We are busy building (right now). We will probably have something out on it maybe before the end of the year. Occupancy will probably be by early next year. It’s been really tough to get any momentum going because of this COVID business. It’s really hard to build right now.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Do you believe this migration from New York City to the suburbs will be a short-term or long-term trend?</p>
<p><strong>Ginsburg:</strong> I think New York City is still New York City and that is not going to change and I think as soon as they have this COVID business under control it will recover. I am assuming that next year is still a COVID year as people wait for the vaccines to come out (and be distributed) and become more secure. I think that in 2022 it (COVID) will already be part of history. They had this “Spanish flu” in 1918 after World War I (that killed 625,000 Americans) and after the flu came the Roaring ‘20s, that was one of the country’s hottest streaks as far as the ‘go-go’ times. People’s memories are very short that way. I think New York is still the commercial center of the country and maybe the world. (Post COVID-19) I think that people will not come to Westchester to get away from COVID like they are doing now. One thing I always felt is that Westchester is a hidden secret from New York City because all the people that have lived in either the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, think that Westchester is upstate… A lot of people are going to learn (just how close Westchester is to New York City. It is so much nicer. We are green up here. You drive around Westchester it is a beautiful county. We got parks, we got lakes, we got the Hudson River, it really is beautiful. I think people will have a lesson in geography. A lot of people are going to learn how close Westchester is (to New York City) and it will be part of their memory bank now and maybe it will register that way. And I think long-term it will be more important than COVID.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What are the impediments to growth at this point, COVID-19, rising cost of lumber, natural gas moratorium?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GINSBURG-PEEKSKILL-GROUNDBREAKING.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34000 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GINSBURG-PEEKSKILL-GROUNDBREAKING.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Ginsburg:</strong> The major thing is high taxes. High taxes are a killer, both New York State taxes, local taxes and real estate taxes. That is a killer, certainly in our area. In order to attract investment, the numbers have to work out. When you put the taxes in, it is certainly an impediment. Almost all of the new development has definitely an IDA PILOT or you can’t make the numbers work… Right now, the (incentives) allow you to make the numbers work so you can get the financing. So, there has to be government flexibility to encourage development and a lot of parts of the state are not really that (business) friendly, which is holding down development there. That is not so much the case in cities in Westchester, New Rochelle for example has all that development because of its program.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What was the most difficult time your firm has faced in its more than 57 years in business and what was the most rewarding?</p>
<p><strong>Ginsburg:</strong> I would say the most difficult time was the ‘Great Recession.’ That was really a bad time. For us it lasted from 2008 to 2011, 2012. That was a long drawn out thing for us. We were deeply invested all over the place and we were building for sale (properties) mostly. So, when you are building for sale you are buying land and when you had a period like that, land was worthless. Nobody wants land. So, we ended up that we were in a deep hole that took us a long time to get out of. I still have debt that I am paying off from that period.</p>
<p>I would say in terms of the most rewarding is whatever I am working on currently. That is where my energy is. One of these days I would like to also write a book because I have done a lot of work over the years. I have probably done more residential work north of New York City than any living person. I am sure of that… I am always trying to do everything better. Whatever I have learned I am trying to make sure that I don’t go backwards on anything.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> One of the lessons Ginsburg, who will turn 86 years of age next month, learned from those hard times was switching from for-sale projects to rental apartment communities, which afford his firm the advantage of retaining an asset as compared to the for-sale development. He quipped that at age 85, he at last is “in a good groove.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Homes sales in the northern suburbs of New York City, with the exception of the Bronx, have emerged strong from the COVID-19 restrictions on real estate showings that were lifted in June and most brokerage firms expect that trend of high sales to continue for the remainder of this year.</p>
<p>As <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> went to press, sections of the Hudson Valley and New York City were seeing increases in daily COVID infection rates and some isolated “hot zones” were subject to some state restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. However, for the most part, the conventional real estate transaction has been re-established and buyer demand, including an increase in interest from New York City residents, is fueling strong sales activity. The only real normal market-related impediment to sales activity is a continued lack of available for-sale inventory throughout the region.</p>
<p>According to the “<a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2020/10/OneKey-MLS-3rd-Qtr-2020-Real-Estate-Market-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2020 Third Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx Counties, New York</strong></a>” released on Oct. 5 by OneKey™ Multiple Listing Service LLC, the single-family segment throughout the region, with the exception of the Bronx, posted increases in sales as compared to last year. Sullivan County experienced a 45% increase in single-family sales over the third quarter of 2019; Westchester County, posted a 12% single-family residential sales increase; Putnam County’s single-family sales were 8.4% higher, while Rockland single-family home sales were up 4.8% and Orange County posted a very respectable 7.9% single-family sales gain.</p>
<p>The Bronx, which likely felt the impact of the troubled New York City market from the coronavirus outbreak, suffered a 21.7% single-family sales decline.</p>
<p>Median sale prices of single-family homes were higher in all counties and significantly higher in some locations. Sullivan County had the highest percentage increase at 33.1% ($197,550 up from $148,450 in Q3 2019). The median sale price in Westchester increased 15.9% to $810,000 from $699,00 (Q3, 2019), the Orange County median was up 14.6% to $330,000 from $288,000 in the third quarter of 2019, Rockland’s median increased 7.4% to $510,000 (from $475,000) and Putnam County’s median rose 9.7% to $411,250 from $375,000 in 2019. The median single-family home price in the Bronx increased 2.5% to $525,000 in the third quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>If there are concerning trends in the region it is the weak sales in the co-op and condominiums sectors. In Westchester County co-op sales were down 25.7% in the third quarter as compared to third quarter of 2019, while condominium sales fell 19% during the same period. Bronx County co-op sales decreased 35.5%, while condominium sales activity fell nearly 31% during the third quarter of this year as compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>OneKey MLS, LLC Board of Managers Chair Leah Caro, who is also president and principal broker of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville, noted that it was June 10th when restrictions on in-person showings were lifted by the state and “real estate came out of hibernation.”</p>
<p>In an interview on the Building and Realty Institute’s radio program Building Knowledge on WVOX-AM, Caro stated, “Third quarter sales were wild,” noting the double-digit increases in single-family home sales and median sale price in Westchester County.</p>
<p>A key data point for the markets is the low level of inventory. Caro related that the inventory of single-family homes for sale in Westchester fell 28.4% in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to a year earlier. She added markets throughout the OneKey MLS area are suffering low inventory levels as well.</p>
<p>“You know what that means, it means people are buying what is out there, just snapping it up, and it also means that anyone thinking of selling their house, get with the program and get your house on the market because the market is there for you,” Caro said.</p>
<p>She theorized that the slowdown in the co-op and condo markets is at least partially due to property owners being more cautious about lifting COVID-restrictions.</p>
<p>Across Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties, the coronavirus has escalated buyer demand to an unparalleled degree, according to a third quarter report released by Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>“New York City buyers leaving the city have rewritten the rules of what today’s buyers want and need. As entire families work from the same home, additional space is a necessity, and the safety of lower density communities during the pandemic has driven demand to historic levels in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties,” said Elizabeth Nunan, president and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence. “Homes on large parcels that will accommodate extended family with space for one or more home offices represent the new ideal home.”</p>
<p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors President Gail Fattizzi, who is also executive director of local independent brokerage real estate network Westchester Real Estate Inc., noted that the trends of higher sales and depleted inventory is happening in markets across the country.</p>
<p>In the Westchester Real Estate third quarter market report, Fattizzi stated that New York City rental prices are down 20% to 25% with a 50% increase in vacant rental units and property sales in the city have also slowed, though she added that there can be signiﬁcant variances from neighborhood to neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are encouraged by home sales so far this year, particularly single-family properties, in a year where a worldwide pandemic and U.S. presidential elections could easily have sidelined the housing market,” Fattizzi said. “The Hudson Valley is resilient and we expect the real estate market here to continue strong through the end of 2020 and into 2021, barring any other unforeseen major obstacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking forward, she believes that mid-range priced properties will continue to be very strong and that buyers should be prepared to wait on lines with dozens of others at open houses for new listings and then plan to compete with over-ask offers. They need to be well-prepared and act quickly to ﬁnd success, she said.</p>
<p>“Despite this, sellers should avoid overly aggressive listing prices if they want to sell this year. While buyers fall over each other to compete for well-priced and located homes, and bids are often above the asking price, they are refraining from sky-high offers and overpriced listings,” Fattizzi warned. “Sellers of luxury homes can expect more interest than they’ve seen the past few years.”</p>
<p>Sales of homes priced at $3 million and above in Westchester were up 50% year-over-year from 2019 to 2020, reﬂecting what she described as a willingness to invest in greater space, comfort and amenities as people are now spending more time at home.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHITE PLAINS—In his State of the County address last evening, which was delayed due to a County Legislator testing positive for COVID-19, earlier this month, Westchester County Executive George Latimer said that while the pandemic is far from over, he is confident the county will recover from the virus’ ill effects.</p>
<p>Noting that the virus first emerged seven months ago, Latimer described the coronavirus’ impact on Westchester by saying: “the county was shaken to its core by the COVID-19 pandemic. It has permeated every aspect of our life here in Westchester County.”</p>
<p>In his speech at the chambers of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the County Executive said, “My friends, we all know the storm clouds still hang over us, we know this squall is far from over—but I am here to tell you tonight that the State of our County is fierce. We are our County, every single one of us, and we are imaginative, and resourceful and we will not let any storm, no matter how heavy the rain or how vicious the winds, claim victory over us—ever.”</p>
<p>The address included a series of short videos that detailed the path the county was on prior to the onset of Coronavirus, the county’s unified response to the pandemic, a plan to move Westchester County forward and a tribute to the Board of Legislators for their work during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Among the initiatives highlighted by the County Executive included: passing a 2020 budget that included a $1-million cut to the Westchester County property tax levy, the establishment of the Urban County Consortium and the Community Development Block Grant Program, breaking ground on the Memorial Field Reconstruction Project in Mount Vernon, furthering Fair and Affordable Housing in Westchester, creating a robust Census outreach and awareness campaign and funding for various environmental initiatives.</p>
<p>Latimer praised Commissioner Dr. Sherlita Amler and the Westchester County Department of Health, who he said rose to the task from the onset of COVID-19, particularly in light of the fact that Westchester was one of the first known hot-spots in the Country.</p>
<p>“In the beginning of March our public health nurses, especially the first three out in the field: Chevon Jones, Caitlin Doyle-Goldsmith, and Cathy Gomez, were busy diagnosing the first cases in New Rochelle,” Latimer said. “They weren’t scared, they didn’t hesitate, in fact their words to 60 Minutes were: ‘This is what public health is, and so this is what we do. This is our job.’ It might be their job – but they are also heroes in every sense of the word, and for that we thank them.”</p>
<p>Latimer also mentioned a number of economic recovery initiatives that have been introduced over the past few months, including setting aside $10 million in funding to create an initiative to support small businesses and nonprofits facing challenges due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>He closed the State of the County address by telling county residents as the coronavirus continues to affect their daily lives: “We pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and move forward—together, united.”</p>
<p>Latimer concluded: “We pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and move forward. Together. United.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>2020 has been a roller coaster of a year. It started out with a booming economy, a robust real estate market and an optimistic outlook for the year. That all quickly changed two months later when the economy virtually came to a halt due to the pandemic. Election Day is now here. As I write, early voting has already started. Below is a rundown of the levels of government up for election this year.</p>
<p>First, is the House of Representatives. All 435 members are up for election this year. Currently Democrats control the House. It takes 218 seats to win a majority. Current election reports show that the Democrats are likely to keep the House and could expand their majority.</p>
<p>In the Senate only about one-third of the seats are up this year. Currently, Republicans control the Senate. Democrats will need to win three seats in order to take control of the Senate if they win the White House, or four seats if the President is re-elected since a 50-50 tie is broken by the Vice President.</p>
<p>All of the seats in the New York State Senate and Assembly are up for election this year. Democrats have wide majorities in both chambers and are expected to keep control. No state-wide office is up for election until 2022.</p>
<p>Please make sure you get out and vote. No matter who you vote for, it is important to exercise your constitutional right. Stay tuned for election results.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ELMSFORD—Since the pandemic began in March and restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of the virus, all too frequently news reports have detailed the unfortunate closure of a popular business somewhere in the Hudson Valley. Recently, news came that COVID-19 took another business victim—the storied Westchester Broadway Theatre in Elmsford which had been a staple for many in the region for nearly a half century.</p>
<p>Like other long-standing businesses that have shut their doors for good due to the pandemic, the Westchester Broadway Theatre will be missed by its patrons and employees, as well as the actors and musicians and technical staff that staged so many productions there.</p>
<p>However, it is rare that a businesses’ impact could be detailed in such stark numbers as the ownership of the WBT described in a recent e-mail to its patrons.</p>
<p>Tucked in a business park for nearly 46 years, owners Bob Funking, Bill and Von Ann Stutler staged lavish and entertaining Broadway productions, many of which received rave reviews. In an e-mailed letter to patrons on Nov. 3, the WBT owners noted at its two Elmsford locations, the Westchester Broadway Theatre produced 217 Broadway musicals and plays, approximately 75 children’s shows, presented 1,500 Monday/Tuesday Specials, employed nearly 5,000 actors, musicians, directors, choreographers, set, lights, sound and hair designers.</p>
<p>The theatre also employed over the years 2,000 dining room and kitchen personnel and in total entertained and served lunch and dinner to an estimated 6 million customers.</p>
<p>The ownership added that the theatre hosted many senior citizens groups, those with physical handicaps, produced benefits for children in institutions, Wounded Warrior fund raisers, high school sports award dinners, weddings, memorial services, business sales meetings (IBM, Subaru, Professional Golf) and many more. The Hudson River Clearwater summer scholarship and the White Plains Senior scholarship were awarded each year at the WBT.</p>
<p>In its e-mail and also in a message on its website, the WBT ownership said the coronavirus’ impact on the theatre industry has been devastating.</p>
<p>“As the world has been plunged into the intense emergency of COVID-19, Broadway has announced it will not reopen until June 2021 or later. Dinner-Theatre, because of social distancing requirements, will be the last entertainment category to be given permission. That may not happen until the end of 2021,” the WBT ownership stated in the Nov. 3 e-mail. “Our landlord, Robert-Martin, does not want to continue supporting our lease and we have no alternative but to close WBT after nearly 46 years. Sadly, the interior is to be destroyed and the building turned into a warehouse.”</p>
<p>They added that the theatre “had to use all its available funds to desperately try to keep the theatre going. Due to this ongoing situation the theatre is financially unable to offer refunds to those customers with advance tickets but has been able to arrange what we believe is a good alternative.” They noted that the White Plains Performing Arts Center has offered to try assisting affected WBT ticket holders by honoring outstanding tickets and gift cards for a future WPPAC show. The WPPAC is receiving no remuneration of any kind for performing this service, they noted.</p>
<p>On the WBT’s website, Stephen Ferri, White Plains PAC’s executive producer, states, “As someone who grew up seeing and working on shows at WBT, it’s with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to our colleague. The work they have done over the years was remarkable. When we heard of this news, we knew we had to do something to not only honor their legacy but also make sure we keep professional theatre alive in Westchester. We are honored to have the torch passed to us at White Plains PAC to take on that task!”</p>
<p>For more information on WPPAC, the details on the exchange program and to take a look at their past productions visit www.wppac.com/wbt . The WPPAC can also be contacted via e-mail at boxoffice@wppac.com or by phone at 914-328-1600.</p>
<p>The WBT ownership in a message to its patrons and employees stated, “It is with a heavy heart that we leave you but wish you much good will, heartfelt thank you, and of course, good live theatre going in the near future. We will miss you!”</p>
<p>Editor’s Note: As a patron of the WBT who has seen a host of very entertaining productions at the theatre, perhaps the most enjoyable part of my evening would be to walk down the two entrance hallways to the dining area and stage to see the numerous photographs of past productions taken by my longtime friend and Real Estate In-Depth photographer John Vecchiolla. While I will miss going to the WBT to celebrate my wedding anniversary or a holiday, the chance to see John’s great photography is perhaps what I will miss the most. A staple of the Hudson Valley’s entertainment industry is gone, one can only hope that perhaps the White Plains Performing Arts Center will help fill the void left by the WBT’s closure.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Brown is often quoted in international newspapers and appears in media broadcasts on a regular basis. His approach in servicing both buyers and sellers has helped him to achieve sales of more than $2 billion.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Growing your international residential real estate business in today’s “new normal” times requires listening, learning, pivoting and adapting. That advice, courtesy of Kevin Brown, senior global real estate advisor and associate broker with Sotheby’s International Realty in Manhattan, was presented on Nov. 5 during the 2020 Global Real Estate Summit, held virtually this year.</p>
<p>Brown is often quoted in international newspapers and appears in media broadcasts on a regular basis. His approach in servicing both buyers and sellers has helped him to achieve sales of more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>Held via Zoom video conference, Brown’s session concentrated on how to navigate and expand global real estate transactions during the continuing pandemic. “You have to be able to pivot your business plans and marketing during these uncertain times,” said Brown. “Be the best listener, learner and adapter that you can and work on getting ahead of the next stage of a crisis.”</p>
<p>Prior to COVID, almost 75% of Brown’s international real estate business came from real estate buyers and investors in China. However, when the pandemic struck, that market began to dry up. “All of a sudden, though, we started getting a lot of inquiries and referrals from Mexico and South America,” he said. “At that point, I had to pivot my marketing to south of the border, making more connections with brokers and bankers in that region.”</p>
<p>Brown’s mantra for expanding business is “follow the money.” He reads “Mansion Global” every week and keeps on top of trends, following where buyers are coming from and where they’re going.</p>
<p>“Then I just reach out to brokers in those areas because I know that every person I touch probably knows another 200 people,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s still all about relationships.”</p>
<p>He also invests in having all of his marketing copy translated to the language of the potential buyer, and even his business cards offer translations on the back. “It’s just another way of respecting your potential clients,” added Brown.</p>
<p>The virus itself was responsible for forcing just about everyone to pivot their business to virtual meetings and showings. “In New York City, we just didn’t do virtual tours, but now I do all of my pitches for major properties via Zoom,” he explained. “People just don’t want to have others roaming through their apartment right now, so I think this technology is definitely here to stay.”</p>
<p>Despite the unfavorable press that New York City real estate has endured lately, Brown remains optimistic. “Manhattan is not emptying out and I believe the marketplace is actually starting to recover,” he explained. On the international front, buyers are still looking to New York as a safe haven because of the way the virus has been handled and because of the region’s renowned health care facilities. “These clients can also escape to New York to be able to do their banking in a stable political system.”</p>
<p>On the domestic side, Brown sees a lot of people who moved to Long Island, the Hudson Valley or Connecticut starting to come back to Manhattan. “Many of them are keeping their suburban locations, and looking for smaller apartments in the city,” he said. “There’s also a shift away from open floor plans. People want their privacy and now everyone wants some outdoor space.”</p>
<p>Interest in Manhattan’s “hot” areas of Tribeca, the Meatpacking District and SoHo are giving way to the quieter neighborhoods of the upper East and West sides. With interest rates still on the decline, Brown predicts a great future for New York City.</p>
<p>Another big change that Brown has seen over the past year is that close to 95% of his business now comes from referrals, as opposed to only 60% just a year ago. To stay on top of this, he sends out some 35,000 e-mails every month to former and potential clients and referring brokers.</p>
<p>He keeps the content focused on lifestyle and community news. “Its so important to be touching someone every month and making that connection,” he added. “While it does take a certain amount of discipline, you have to be consistent to get the results.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It is not uncommon for real estate brokers and agents to make requests, and many times demands, at the closing table for certain documents, such as the lender’s Closing Disclosure, the Contract of Sale, and other documents. Brokers and agents claim that the law requires that these documents be provided because they are mandated under the New York State Department of State regulations [see<a href="https://on.ny.gov/3eSar4O" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://on.ny.gov/3eSar4O</a>] and other regulations to maintain copies of these documents.</p>
<p>Many times, agents attending a real estate closing demand that the parties and/or the parties’ attorneys provide them with copies of the CD, the Contract and even the Lead Paint Disclosure Addendum (which should already be in their possession since they are required by law to have this form signed early on in the process, prior to any closing), or else, as they state, “My broker will not pay me my commission!” This article will attempt to clarify certain misconceptions about what the brokers’ and agents’ duties are with respect to document retention requirements and which documents they are and are not entitled to.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements Under Section §175.23 of the DOS Regulations</strong></p>
<p>According to Section 175.23 (“Records of transactions to be maintained”), subsection (a) requires that “[e]ach licensed broker shall keep and maintain for a period of three years, paper and/or electronic records of each transaction effected through his or her office concerning the sale of real property used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, wholly or partly, as the home or residence of one or more persons improved by a one-to-four-family dwelling, or a condominium or cooperative apartment but shall not refer to unimproved real property upon which such dwellings are to be constructed.” Therefore, brokers are required to maintain records for a period of not less than three years for all transactions involving one- to four-family homes, condominium units and cooperative apartments, but not those involving vacant lots.</p>
<p>Copies of these documents may be maintained either electronically or physically. If maintained electronically, the brokerage firm must ensure that there is a backup maintained of all such records. Section 175.23(a) provides that the “records” must contain the following information:</p>
<p>(1) the names and addresses of the seller and the buyer,<br />
(2) the broker prepared purchase contract or binder, or if the purchase contract is not prepared by the broker, then the purchase price and the amount of deposit (if collected by broker),<br />
(3) the amount of commission paid to broker,<br />
(4) the gross profit realized by the broker if purchased by him or her for resale,<br />
(5) any document required under Article 12-A of the Real Property Law, and<br />
(6) the listing agreement or commission agreement or buyer-broker agreement.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Section 175.23 (b) provides that “[i]n some transactions, the broker may not be provided a copy of the documents required to be maintained by subdivision (a) of this section. In such instances, the broker will not be found to have violated the requirements of this section.” Therefore, contrary to the opinion of many brokers, if the broker is not provided with a copy of some of the records referenced in subsection (a), then the broker, and in turn the salesperson, will not be deemed to have violated Section 175.23.</p>
<p><strong>Is A Broker Required to Maintain the Contract of Sale?</strong></p>
<p>Many brokers and agents also believe that they are required to maintain a copy of the fully executed contract in connection with a real estate transaction and that attorneys are required to provide them with a copy of it. This, however, is not the case.</p>
<p>Under Section 175.23(a)(2), the broker is only required to maintain “the broker-prepared purchase contract or binder, or if the purchase contract is not prepared by the broker, then the purchase price and the amount of deposit (if collected by broker).” Therefore, while it is commonplace in Upstate New York for brokers and agents to prepare the real estate contract, that is not the case in southern parts of New York State. In southern New York (notably most areas including and south of Orange and Dutchess counties), the real estate contract is prepared by attorneys. Therefore, in these instances, brokers are not required to maintain and are not entitled to receive a copy of the contract.</p>
<p>It is recommended that both real estate agents and attorneys discuss the issue of sharing a copy of the contract at the start of any engagement. Before an attorney shares a copy of the contract of sale with any party, including real estate agents, the attorney must obtain consent from the client to do so. Attorneys can choose to address this issue in their engagement letters and obtain advance consent from the seller or purchaser to provide a copy of the contract to limited parties such as real estate agents, brokers and title agents. Brokers and agents should also inform their client that they are not entitled to receive a copy of the contract unless the client provides his or her attorney with consent to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Are Attorneys Permitted to Provide Brokers </strong><strong>And Agents a Copy of the Contract?</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, the New York State Bar Association’s Committee on Professional Ethics issued an important ethics opinion [Ethics Opinion 1161, see <a href="https://bit.ly/2UgTg3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2UgTg3d</a>] clarifying an attorney’s obligation with respect to release of the copy of the contract of sale to real estate brokers and agents in connection with a transaction. The committee held that “[w]hen a lawyer rather than a broker prepares a real estate contract, the lawyer may not disclose the contract to the broker without the client’s informed consent….”</p>
<p>Rule 1.6(a) of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct (the “Ethics Rules”) provides that a lawyer “…shall not knowingly reveal confidential information” without the client’s consent. And, while this rule applies specifically to attorneys, it is important to note that brokers and agents, who are also bound by the fiduciary duty of confidentiality, may not reveal confidential information without first obtaining the client’s consent.</p>
<p>Under the Ethics Rules, “confidential information” means “information gained during or relating to the representation of a client, whatever its source, that is (a) protected by the attorney-client privilege, (b) likely to be embarrassing or detrimental to the client if disclosed, or (c) information that the client has requested to be kept confidential.” This is one of the most important duties in an attorney-client relationship and is just as important in the agent-client relationship in a real estate transaction. These issues should be discussed in advance, at the beginning of the real estate transaction so that there is no misunderstanding as to the obligations and duties of the parties with respect to releasing and receiving confidential information.</p>
<p><strong>May an Attorney Simply ‘Bury’ the Broker’s or Agent’s Request?</strong></p>
<p>The committee also indicated that the attorney “…may not bury the broker’s request.” The attorney is required to let the client know that a request had been made by the broker or agent. The attorney is not permitted to simply ignore the broker or deny the broker’s request without letting the client know that a request has been made. Similarly, a broker or agent is not permitted to withhold information, such as an offer, without letting the client know in every instance. Under the Ethics Rules, an attorney “…shall promptly inform the client of,” among other things, “any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client’s informed consent…is required ….”</p>
<p>The Ethics Rules define “informed consent” as “…the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer [or agent] has communicated information adequate for the person to make an informed decision, and after the lawyer [or agent] has explained to the person the material risks of the proposed course of conduct and reasonably available alternatives.” The committee points out that the attorney, or alternatively, an agent, must consider the “…facts and circumstances” of each situation in order to “…determine the adequacy of disclosure.” The Opinion provides a useful analysis for all fiduciaries, whether attorneys or real estate agents, to utilize when determining the extent of the disclosure in instances requiring informed consent, as well as instances involving the sharing of confidential information.</p>
<p><strong>Is a Broker or Agent Required to Receive </strong><strong>A Copy of the Closing Disclosure at Closing?</strong></p>
<p>Another common misconception is that the brokers and agents are required to receive a copy of the Closing Disclosure at Closing, and that the brokerage firm is required to maintain a copy of the CD under Section 175.23. It is not uncommon for agents at the closing to request a copy of the CD because their brokerage firm requires it as a precondition for the agent to be paid a commission. Again, it should not be a requirement of the brokerage to condition payment of a commission upon receipt of the CD. The only information the broker or agent is required to maintain is that which is listed in Section 175.23.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Concerns and The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</strong></p>
<p>The same analysis and requirements that apply to the delivery of the contract or other confidential documents also apply to the delivery of the CD. Again, attorneys must obtain the consent of the client before releasing a copy of the CD at closing. Currently, with the introduction of the new Closing Disclosure (which replaced the previous HUD Settlement Statement), this is usually not a controversial issue. Most lenders prepare a separate Seller’s CD and Purchaser’s CD, which is permitted under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3eS0Ive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3eS0Ive</a>] as implemented by Regulation P [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3lpsjGL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3lpsjGL</a>], so as to address privacy concerns related to the release of the borrower’s private information. The release of the borrower’s personal and financial information is strictly governed by federal and state law. The National Association of Realtors has prepared a useful TRID Closing Disclosure Guide, which provides a detailed explanation of the disclosure requirements relating to the CD [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3loDv6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3loDv6s</a>].</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the event a client does not want the CD to be shared with the brokers or agents, or in the event there is only one collective CD prepared and the lender restricts sharing same, the agents must refrain from making any further demand. Additionally, if the parties refuse to share the CD, the brokerage firm should not refuse to pay the agent based on receipt of the CD.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity Adds Comfort</strong></p>
<p>Many misconceptions have developed over the years and have become commonplace, which brokers and agents believe are legal requirements. While many documents under the DOS Regulations and Article 12-A of the Real Property law are required to be maintained for three years, the items addressed in this article are not. This should allow brokers and agents to reduce some of the paperwork they maintain and also reduce the stress level in a transaction when an attorney or client does not want to share certain documents.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHITE PLAINS—When the 117th Congress convenes on Jan. 3, 2021, an era in Hudson Valley politics will come to an end.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> thought it only appropriate to honor a woman who has spent the past 32 years tirelessly advocating in the halls of Congress for her constituents in the 17th New York Congressional District—U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Lowey, who in 2018 became the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee, announced last fall that she would retire and not run for re-election to Congress in 2020. Beginning in January 2021, Democrat Mondaire Jones will represent the 17th New York Congressional District, replacing Rep. Lowey, who held the office for 16 terms beginning in 1988.</p>
<p>As the text of our conversation with the Congresswoman below will clearly reveal, Rep. Lowey represented the 17th District, which consists of a portion of Westchester and all of Rockland County, with distinction. She broke glass ceilings and was a strong advocate for human rights, education, health care and so much more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34392 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey-3.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Lowey in 2001 and 2002 was selected as the first woman and the first New Yorker to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She has been a leading Congressional proponent of educational opportunity, health care quality and biomedical research, improved homeland security preparedness, stricter public safety laws, environmental protection, women&#8217;s issues, national security and a champion for the United States to play a leading international role and national security.</p>
<p>An outspoken supporter of transportation, nuclear, and infrastructure security, Lowey was appointed to the Select Committee on Homeland Security and was recognized for her leadership in securing more than $20 billion for recovery efforts after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. She has also helped to obtain more than $68 million in federal funds to develop local bioterrorism response plans and to provide local first responders with interoperable communication devices, rescue equipment, and personal protective gear. Under Rep. Lowey’s leadership, federal funding for after-school programs has increased from $1 million in 1996 to $1 billion today.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-34395" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey.png" alt="" width="375" height="253" /></a>Among her many accomplishments, Rep. Lowey, as a candidate for Congress in 1988, pledged to clean up the Long Island Sound and in 1990 she passed legislation establishing a special Environmental Protection Agency office for Long Island Sound and has obtained millions of dollars in federal funding for local clean-up efforts. A co-founder of the Hudson River Caucus, Lowey has also taken a key role in protecting the New York City watershed and in preserving strong environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.</p>
<p>A native of the Bronx, Rep. Lowey graduated from the Bronx High School of Science; and received a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree from Mount Holyoke College. She served as Assistant Secretary of State for the State of New York before being elected to Congress. She and Stephen Lowey have been married for more than 50 years and have three grown children and eight grandchildren.</p>
<p>Let’s find out Rep. Lowey’s views on her past work, the upcoming Biden Administration and the chances for repeal of the SALT Cap and for enactment of a much-needed COVID relief package by Congress in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> You are now into your 16th term representing your constituents in the 17th Congressional District. Looking back, what would you say were your biggest accomplishments? Was there anything you would have liked to accomplish in your time in Congress that for whatever reason was not fulfilled?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34393 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey-2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Rep. Lowey:</strong> First of all, becoming the chair of Appropriations (Committee), especially breaking the glass ceiling for women. I also broke the glass ceiling becoming the first woman to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2001 and 2002. Legislation that actually saved and improved lives here in the Hudson Valley and around the world, such as .08 (blood alcohol content) drunk driving standard; food allergy labeling, which requires the main eight food allergies to be disclosed in plain language; investments in gender equity in federal medical research; record funding and a U.S. strategy for basic education, especially for girls around the world… women’s health funding at home and abroad; Title X and international family planning and at every level from pre-school to Head Start through higher education, record levels of support to improve access and equality.</p>
<p>Some of my most poignant memories were working to rebuild after Sept. 11th. That was really quite an extraordinary opportunity for me and again after Superstorm Sandy. Another was storming the Senate in 1991 to insist that Anita Hill be allowed to testify in Clarence Thomas’ nomination hearings (for the U.S. Supreme Court). We were just fighting for what was right at the time and now nearly 30 years later that is seen as a pivotal moment in the fight for women’s rights and equality. And then I have to include bringing “Bert” and “Ernie” to testify at a 1995 Labor-HHS hearing to support PBS (funding). I never got so much press in my life than that one. That was for saving PBS.</p>
<p>Before I finish my term in Congress I would like to get all of our appropriation bills passed and negotiate a final coronavirus package as well.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Post-Election, do you believe that President Biden will be able to finally negotiate a multi-year infrastructure bill with a likely split Congress?</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Lowey:</strong> Investments in infrastructure are long overdue and the Biden campaign put together a comprehensive plan to build a more resilient and sustainable infrastructure system that is suited to combat the effect of <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-34394" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nita-Lowey-1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a>climate change. With a clear majority in the House and the Senate still to be determined, I am confident the new administration will be able to work with both Democrats and Republicans to negotiate and pass an effective bill. I am always an optimist and with President Biden in the White House and hopefully this current President will take a good long vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> One of the more damaging pieces of the Federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act bill was the imposition of the SALT cap. Do you feel that under the new administration there is a good chance of repealing the SALT cap?</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Lowey:</strong> Well, capping state and local tax deductions at $10,000 is shameful, particularly when you consider the high tax burden in New York and the fact that Westchester and Rockland families and businesses already send more to the federal government than they get back in federal investments. The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors hosted several roundtables and spoke at my press conferences in support of my legislation that Rep. Peter King (R-Long Island) introduced to remove the cap. Simply put, this tax scam places a target on the backs of New York taxpayers, including many of my constituents and the bottom line is capping the SALT deduction is forcing some to leave New York State, leading to higher taxes or a significant reduction in vital local services, such as first responders and health care. So, I will continue to fight for the full restoration of the SALT deduction to protect taxpayers for the remainder of my term and I certainly hope the Biden Administration will work with Congress to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Now that the election is over, do you feel there is a greater chance for another coronavirus stimulus bill that would include the necessary state and local government aid? If no such aid is forthcoming, what will the consequences be for the state and Hudson Valley region?</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Lowey:</strong> President-Elect Biden has already proven that he is taking this crisis seriously by forming the Coronavirus Task Force and since the Senate failed to take up the House-passed Heroes Act, the House then passed an updated Heroes Act last month and Senator Mitch McConnell refused to bring the bill to the floor for consideration and negotiation. Just after the elections, Republicans signaled they would be willing to negotiate a bill, including significant state and local government aid. I am hopeful that they will stay true to their word and help New Yorkers in these difficult, tough economic times.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> When asked if no such aid is forthcoming, Rep. Lowey said such inaction would have a tremendous adverse impact on New York and the nation.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Do you feel that President Elect Biden will approve the New York City congestion pricing plan that has been delayed by the current administration?</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Lowey:</strong> Well, that is something that New York and the Biden Administration will have to work out. I look forward to see what they decide to do.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales continued to trend upward in October, marking five consecutive months of month-over-month gains, according to the National Association of Realtors. All four major regions reported both month-over-month and year-over-year growth, with the Midwest experiencing the greatest monthly increase. Existing home sales rose 4.7% in the Northeast in October.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—increased 4.3% from September to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.85 million in October. Overall, sales rose year-over-year, up 26.6% from a year ago (5.41 million in October 2019), according to the report released by NAR recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering that we remain in a period of stubbornly high unemployment relative to pre-pandemic levels, the housing sector has performed remarkably well this year,&#8221; said Lawrence Yun, NAR&#8217;s chief economist.</p>
<p>While coronavirus-induced shutdowns hindered virtually all markets, Yun said the housing industry has mounted an impressive rebound.</p>
<p>&#8220;The surge in sales in recent months has now offset the spring market losses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With news that a COVID-19 vaccine will soon be available, and with mortgage rates projected to hover around 3% in 2021, I expect the market&#8217;s growth to continue into 2021.&#8221; Yun forecasts existing-home sales to rise by 10% to 6 million in 2021.</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in October was $313,000, up 15.5% from October 2019 ($271,100), as prices increased in every region. October&#8217;s national price increase marks 104 straight months of year-over-year gains.</p>
<p>Total housing inventory at the end of October totaled 1.42 million units, down 2.7% from September and down 19.8% from one year ago (1.77 million). Unsold inventory sits at an all-time low 2.5-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 2.7 months in September and down from the 3.9-month figure recorded in October 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homebuilders&#8217; confidence has soared even though the actual production has not,&#8221; Yun said. &#8220;All measures, such as reduction to lumber tariffs and expansion of vocational training, need to be considered to significantly boost supply and construct new housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yun&#8217;s call for an increase in newly built homes comes on the heels of NAR&#8217;s quarterly Metropolitan Median Area Prices and Affordability report, which found that single-family existing-home prices rose in all of the 181 metropolitan areas NAR tracks. Sixty-five percent of those metros show double-digit price increases. Yun says replenishing the short supply of homes would help decelerate rising costs and improve market affordability.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 21 days in October, seasonally even with September and down from 36 days in October 2019. Seventy-two percent of homes sold in October 2020 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 32% of sales in October, up from the 31% in both September 2020 and October 2019. NAR&#8217;s 2020 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released last week—revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 31%.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, purchased 14% of homes in October, a small increase from the 12% figure recorded in September 2020 and equal to October 2019. All-cash sales accounted for 19% of transactions in October, up from 18% in September but unchanged from October 2019.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in October, equal to September&#8217;s percentage but down from 2% in October 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faced with many uncertainties in 2020, the real estate industry has been able to meet surprisingly strong homebuying demand and help lead our country&#8217;s economic recovery,&#8221; said NAR President Charlie Oppler, a Realtor from Franklin Lakes, NJ, and broker/owner of Prominent Properties Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty. &#8220;As we continue to help consumers secure housing and property, we will also remain vigilant in working to expand housing options, equality and affordability for all who are entering the marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 2.83% in October, down from 2.89% in September. The average commitment rate across all of 2019 was 3.94%.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales sat at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.12 million in October, up 4.1% from 5.88 million in September, and up 26.7% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $317,700 in October, up 16.0% from October 2019.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 730,000 units in October, up 5.8% from September and up 25.9% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $273,600 in October, an increase of 10.3% from a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Median home prices increased at double-digit rates in each of the four major regions from one year ago.</p>
<p>October 2020 saw existing-home sales in the Northeast climb 4.7%, recording an annual rate of 900,000, a 30.4% increase from a year ago. The median price in the Northeast was $356,500, up 20.2% from October 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales jumped 8.6% in the Midwest to an annual rate of 1,640,000 in October, up 28.1% from a year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $243,500, a 16.7% increase from October 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South increased 3.2% to an annual rate of 2.91 million in October, up 26.5% from the same time one year ago. The median price in the South was $272,500, a 15.7% increase from a year ago.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West inched up 1.4% to an annual rate of 1,400,000 in October, an 22.8% increase from a year ago. The median price in the West was $467,800, up 15.1% from October 2019.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The old proverb states, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” This becomes the challenge to all buyer agents acting in their client’s best interests; do the right thing, but don’t do it to such an extent to cause harm.</p>
<p>In past years, Realtors encouraged drafting a “love letter” to the homeowner, where the buyer would make an emotional appeal to the homeowner as to why they should sell their home to them. Another strategy was to employ the use of an “escalation clause” where a buyer’s offer increased incrementally based upon certain factors, hopefully making the buyer’s offer the winning bid. While both these ideas seemed like strong strategies and were supportive of acting in a client’s bests interests, they are now being questioned for their shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>Love Letters</strong></p>
<p>The idea is that the buyer sends a heartfelt letter to the homeowner explaining why the homeowner should sell their home to them. These letters are more about emotion and less about facts. While these letters sound like a great opportunity to have your client explain why they should be chosen, they have a strong potential of exposing your client to fair housing discrimination (and open the agent to fair housing violations) because they provide the homeowner with personal information and characteristics that might not otherwise be revealed. These factors may knowingly or unconsciously be used to reject your client.</p>
<p>The typical letter may say how the buyer looks forward to their children playing in the back yard, or hanging Christmas decorations on the front porch, or how they look forward to grandma being able to visit and make matzo ball soup in the kitchen. Or maybe they say how it’s close to the church they attend, or it’s near the military base where someone serves. While all this information creates character, it also lets the homeowner know things that they should not be aware of: religion, familial status, age, race, military status are just a few of the protected classes that may be revealed. Based upon this information, the homeowner may reject the client and, importantly for the Realtor providing this information, the agent may be in violation of fair housing laws (they’re not supposed to provide this information).</p>
<p>As a result, NAR, NYSAR and many brokerages discourage the use of “love letters.” Best practices dictate that in an effort to protect your client and yourself from fair housing issues you should:</p>
<p>1. Explain the pitfalls of these letters;</p>
<p>2. Remind your client that your duty and their decision to buy should be based upon objective criteria (price, terms, etc.) and not emotion;</p>
<p>3. Refuse to deliver, read, or assist in the writing of these letters; and</p>
<p>4. If you represent the seller who receives a letter, suggest they not read it and/or document all offers received and the seller’s reasoning for accepting/rejecting them.</p>
<p><strong>Escalation Clauses</strong></p>
<p>An escalation clause is a provision in an offer where the buyer agrees to increase the amount they are willing to pay based upon the highest offer presented. The clause will automatically increase the offer price just above that highest offer to a maximum cap, otherwise, they could pay too much (For example, Buyer A has an escalation clause that states that she “will pay $500 more than the highest offer up to a cap of $500,000.”) The benefit of an escalation clause is that it reduces the amount a buyer will pay to an amount just above the highest offer and reduces the risk of overpaying for a property. However, this practice is fraught with problems.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Realtors try to draft these clauses themselves. Usually, these clauses end up poorly drafted and expose their clients to liability. But, worse is that the Realtor may be deemed engaging in the “practice of law,” which is prohibited by the Code of Ethics and a violation of state law. Obviously, this is bad and could jeopardize the Realtor’s reputation or career. Realtors who are not licensed attorneys should never draft escalation clauses.</p>
<p>Second, in controlling the amount a buyer will pay for a property, the buyer may be revealing their maximum offer price. This is the buyer’s most prized secret. Armed with this information, the seller can now leverage it, as the Code of Ethics states that offers are not confidential and may be “shopped” by the seller. Therefore, a seller may now reveal how much the buyer is willing to pay in an effort to get another buyer to offer more. As a result, some escalation clauses have a non-disclosure provision. While this may strengthen the privacy of the offer, problems remain: (1) the homeowner may reject the offer with the non-disclosure provision until such time that the provision is removed; (2) depending on how the non-disclosure is drafted, the homeowner may reject the offer and, thereafter, share the offer to other prospective buyers; (3) share the offer with other possible buyers in violation of the provision with the hope that the buyer with the non-disclosure will never know about it being shared.</p>
<p>Third, what happens when more than one escalation clause is presented? By simple operation, both clauses act in tandem and immediately escalate the offer price to the price above the lowest maximum cap. For example, Buyer A has “$500 above the next highest offer up to a cap of $550,000.” Buyer B has a clause that says “$500 above the next highest offer up to a cap of $600,000.” If the current asking price is $200,000, it is instantaneously increased to $600,000 (Buyer A will pay up to $550,000 and Buyer B will pay $500 above that). This may not be the best plan for a buyer and the buyer may be better off negotiating direct with the seller. Exacerbating this problem is the potential for “friendly” escalation clauses that may be fraudulent. These “friendly” clauses are made by fictitious or by friendly buyers who make offers for the sole purpose of triggering the escalation clause.</p>
<p>These “friendly” offers bring us to the final problem: proof of the next highest offer. Often, in an effort to prove that there is another offer that is being outbid, the presenter of the escalation clause will demand a copy of the next highest offer. However, as noted previously, some offers have a non-disclosure form. The seller may refuse to present that lower offer to the buyer with the escalation clause for fear of violating the non-disclosure agreement. Alternatively, if a “friendly” offer was presented, the buyer with the escalation clause has no way of knowing if it was a legitimate offer.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While Realtors use their best efforts and are required to act in the best interests of clients in a race to get a buyer for their desired property, the buyer’s agent may have a lapse in judgment. While “love letters” and escalation clauses seem like great shortcuts down a path to success, think before utilizing these tools. Consult with your broker or even speak to an attorney. The primrose path you are on can get scary, dark, and in some cases hotter than hell if it involves your license or litigation.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>CHICAGO—Chief officials with the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors hailed the recent vote by the Board of Directors of the National Association of Realtors to strengthen the Code of Ethics and ban harassing or hate speech by its members.</p>
<p>On Nov. 13, the Board of Directors of the National Association of Realtors voted in favor of a motion presented by NAR&#8217;s Professional Standards Committee making it a violation for Realtors to use harassing or hate speech toward any of the protected classes under Article 10 of NAR&#8217;s Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>Those include race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity. The Professional Standards Committee recommendations came as NAR works to reaffirm its commitment to fair housing and position its members to lead America&#8217;s real estate industry in the fight against discrimination and inequality.</p>
<p>“I applaud NAR&#8217;s Board of Directors and our Professional Standards Committee for their efforts to raise the bar on the professionalism and private speech of America&#8217;s 1.4 million Realtors,&#8221; said NAR President Vince Malta, broker at Malta &amp; Co., Inc., of San Francisco. &#8220;Combatting and overcoming bigotry and injustice starts with each of us. Realtors today took tangible steps to ensure we are held to the highest possible standard while providing a mechanism of enforcement for those who violate our new policies.”</p>
<p>Local, state and national Realtor associations received various complaints about discriminatory speech posted online by Realtors earlier this year, particularly on social media. In subsequent months, NAR&#8217;s Professional Standards Committee and Interpretations Procedures Advisory Board met to consider the Code of Ethics&#8217; applicability to discriminatory speech and conduct beyond a Realtor’s real estate duties.</p>
<p>Following months of meetings and deliberations, NAR&#8217;s Advisory Board recently recommended that its Code of Ethics apply to every action a Realtor takes, whether personal or professional.</p>
<p>Any complaint alleging a violation of Article 10 as illustrated by Standard of Practice 10-5 can now be brought to a hearing panel at a local Realtor association, which will be asked to assess the circumstances of each individual case.</p>
<p>The new Standard of Practice under Article 10 now reads:</p>
<p><em>“Standard of Practice 10-5</em></p>
<p><em>REALTORS® must not use harassing speech, hate speech, epithets, or slurs based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.”</em></p>
<p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty praised the NAR Board’s action, saying, “Bravo for raising the bar for Realtor conduct when it comes to fair housing and recognizing that words, as well as deeds, matter. Bravo for standing up to the plate and taking action on such an important issue when it would be so easy and safe to say, let’s not rock the boat—it’s up to others to police this issue. Bravo for leading the fight against discrimination and inequality.”</p>
<p>Haggerty, who spent 28 years as the professional standards administrator for the association prior to his appointment as CEO eight years ago, noted that any issues involving the new regulation will be treated no different than enforcement of other Articles of the Code and will be the subject of due process and a hearings panel if necessary.</p>
<p>“It’s too easy to post hate filled rants denigrating other people on social media with no accountability. As NAR puts it, it’s not OK to be a Realtor by day and a keyboard bigot by night,” Haggerty said. “I applaud NAR leadership for creating accountability and for not taking the easy path, but rather the right path for our Realtor members and the communities they serve.”</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> For Haggerty’s full opinion on the NAR action, see his <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/viewpoints/gateway-perspectives-hate-speech-has-no-place-in-the-realtor-vocabulary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gateway Perspectives column</a>.</p>
<p>NYSAR President Jennifer Stevenson also expressed her support for the changes included in Article 10-5 of the Realtor Code of Ethics, stating that the NAR Board made a “bold statement that hate speech and related actions at any time are now considered a violation of public trust and subject to disciplinary action under the Code of Ethics and may be a determination of membership and reporting to the Department of State.”</p>
<p>She added in a videotaped message, “Realtor membership is a privilege not a right. It is wholly appropriate that membership should be based upon a member’s words and actions no matter where they occur.”</p>
<p>Overall, although the proposal seeks to extend enforcement of the Code beyond its current limits of real estate transactions and real estate-related activities, this added reach will not increase a Realtor or Realtor-Principal&#8217;s liability under the law, NAR officials stated.</p>
<p>Moving forward, NAR&#8217;s Professional Standards Committee will continue working to develop case interpretations to assist members and professional standards enforcement volunteers in understanding the Code&#8217;s applicability.</p>
<p>The NAR Professional Standards Committee met on Oct. 5 to consider recommendations from its Interpretations and Procedures Advisory Board on the Code of Ethics’ applicability to discriminatory speech and conduct. The committee approved the Advisory Board’s recommendations, and six of them were presented to and approved by the NAR Board of Directors at its Nov. 13 meeting. The changes will be effective immediately. Training schedules and materials will be available in the coming weeks.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency announced on Nov. 25 it recently granted final approval for incentives ranging from $6.5 million to $13 million to Morgan Stanley for the financial services firm’s planned more than $200-million renovation of its corporate office complex at 2000 Westchester Ave. in Harrison.</p>
<p>The Industrial Development Agency stated that the IDA Board voted in favor of the incentives at its Nov. 23rd session. Morgan Stanley, which has occupied the majority of the 750,000 square-foot building since the early 2000s, is planning a comprehensive interior redesign, renovation and additional investment in its Westchester campus to enable the facility to consolidate certain functions. The complex, which was built in 1977, is the former world headquarters of Texaco.</p>
<p>The incentive package could be more or less than the $6.5 million to $13-million range depending on the final scope of the project, the Westchester IDA stated in its announcement. Morgan Stanley is also seeking a PILOT agreement with the Town of Harrison that has not been finalized.</p>
<p>According to an economic benefit analysis prepared for the IDA by Camoin Associates, the number of jobs to be created over the course of the project is estimated in the range of 700 to 1,100 new positions. The project is also estimated to retain between 1,200 and 1,350 employees and create approximately 923 construction jobs.</p>
<p>The analysis estimates new property tax revenue over 10 years in the range of $12 million to $18 million as well as $15 million to $25 million in county property and sales tax revenues over the same 10-year period.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley renovation project will incorporate energy efficient and sustainable features.</p>
<p>“Today’s important vote by the IDA reaffirms Westchester County’s reputation as having a business-friendly climate where companies both large and small can prosper and grow. We applaud Morgan Stanley for their significant investment in our county that will create and retain thousands of well-paying jobs. In today’s difficult economy, this is great news indeed,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.</p>
<p>“The financial incentives approved today for Morgan Stanley will result in significant and long-term benefits for Westchester County and its ability to attract new businesses. Today’s vote also demonstrates the critically important role that the Westchester IDA plays in the economic strength and vitality of our county,” added IDA Chair Joan McDonald.</p>
<p>The planned investment follows other major corporate users in the county that have undertaken significant renovation programs, including PepsiCo, which embarked on a more than $240-million capital improvement program on its Westchester County properties. PepsiCo assistance from the Westchester County IDA and New York State in 2012.</p>
<p>According to minutes of the IDA’s Oct. 8th session posted on the agency’s website, Joseph Carlucci, a partner with White Plains-based law firm Cuddy &amp; Feder, presented the Morgan Stanley (MS Harrison) application to the IDA. He stated that, if approved, Morgan Stanley planned to relocate its Wealth Management division to the Harrison complex.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is considering several locations around the country in which to consolidate their wealth management group, the IDA minutes state. “Some key considerations are cost of construction, tax benefits that are available, abatement of property taxes, etc. Other locations have lower costs therefore the Westchester location does have some shortcomings, but the IDA benefits would make Westchester competitive with other locations by evening out the cost,” according to the IDA minutes. Carlucci said the project is contingent on IDA benefits due to the high costs of construction, labor and taxes. Morgan Stanley would not be able to sustain this facility without the IDA benefits,&#8221; the IDA minutes state.</p>
<p>Dan Haggarty, managing director of Morgan Stanley, also spoke about the project at the Oct. 8th session. He noted, according to the meeting minutes, that the goal of the project is to improve the workplace of the employees as well as improve the amenities for the employees, such as increasing the size and design of the conference and meeting rooms.</p>
<p>Other planned upgrades include lighting improvements and paving in the parking and drop-off areas.</p>
<p>The IDA minutes further state that Haggarty told the IDA the renovation of 2000 Westchester Ave. might also include building a walkway from the parking lot, developing a solar field to assist with the property’s energy efficiency, increasing circulation routes within the building, upgrading the lobby, and instituting  a better integrated experience with the landscape of the building. The company also intends to update the fitness center and provide physical therapy rooms and a health center. Other planned amenities include an ATM, a small convenience store, upgrading the TV studios and other areas for employees and visitors. Morgan Stanley could not be reached for comment at press time.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought the property in 2002 and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings is a major tenant at the property that has a lease that extends through May 2027. In the fall of 2009, Atlas Air announced it was renewing and extending its headquarters lease long-term at 2000 Westchester Ave. and investing nearly $38 million on office space upgrades and equipment.</p>
<p>Atlas Air reported it had signed a long-term lease renewal for its approximately 120,000-square-foot headquarters at the former Texaco headquarters. The company told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> at the time that its extension did not involve any increase in the size of its headquarters space and that the company’s $37.5-million investment over the next five years would involve efforts to optimize its existing space. The company said it would retain the 568 jobs currently housed at the four-story, 750,000-square-foot building.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[If all safety and efficacy approvals are granted by the federal government, the state expects to receive the vaccines—which were created by Pfizer—on Dec. 15. New York State expects additional allocations of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna later this month.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—In another sign of some light at the end of the tunnel on the COVID crisis, at a press conference on Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State will soon receive an initial delivery of enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for 170,000 New Yorkers.</p>
<p>If all safety and efficacy approvals are granted by the federal government, the state expects to receive the vaccines—which were created by Pfizer—on Dec. 15. New York State expects additional allocations of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we continue to move through the holiday season, the good news is that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but unfortunately it is still a ways away and we are now faced with a set of challenges to overcome before we get there. Not only is the number of COVID-19 cases rising virtually everywhere, but they are stemming from a new source, with nearly 70% of cases being traced back to households and private gatherings,&#8221; Governor Cuomo said.</p>
<p>The governor also complained that the federal government is not contributing any funding to support the distribution of the vaccine. He also noted that the federal vaccination plan “not only overlooks the black, brown, and poor communities, but its data sharing provisions will dissuade the undocumented community from getting a vaccination. Winning the war against COVID has to be an inclusive process and only by everyone working together will we be successful. While we continue to fight to make the federal plan more inclusive, effective and fair, New Yorkers need to do their part to help limit the spread.”</p>
<p>The statewide COVID positivity rate on Dec. 1 was 4.63%.</p>
<p>The governor noted that the positive testing rate in all focus areas under the state&#8217;s Micro-Cluster strategy on Tuesday was 5.88%, and outside the focus zone areas was 4.21%. Within the focus areas, 49,027 test results were reported yesterday, yielding 2,882 positives. In the remainder of the state, not counting these focus areas, 144,524 test results were reported, yielding 6,091 positives.</p>
<p>The positivity rate for the Mid-Hudson region on Tuesday was 4.94%, while New York City’s COVID positivity rate was 3.34%.</p>
<p>There were 69 COVID-19 related deaths in the state on Tuesday, including three residents of Westchester and the Bronx and one each in Rockland, Orange and Manhattan, bringing the pandemic statewide total to 26,889.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[County Executive Neuhaus and Guarino, who is vice chairman of New York City-based Korn Ferry, were among the speakers at the Orange County Partnership’s Annual Event held for the first time virtually on Dec. 2. The program was entitled “Resilience: Powering Through the Pause.”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In spite of rising coronavirus cases in the county and throughout New York State, Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus and keynote speaker and well-known executive recruiting executive Alan Guarino are bullish on the county’s prospects in 2021 now that vaccines will be arriving later this month.</p>
<p>County Executive Neuhaus and Guarino, who is vice chairman of New York City-based Korn Ferry, were among the speakers at the Orange County Partnership’s Annual Event held for the first time virtually on Dec. 2. The program was entitled “Resilience: Powering Through the Pause.”</p>
<p>Guarino, who is a graduate of West Point and who initially launched an executive recruiting firm in Newburgh, said that prior to the onset of the pandemic in March of this year, there was a prevailing trend the previous five years where some city workers were relocating to suburban locations or working from home, while Millennials workers were drawn to urban centers for lifestyle reasons.</p>
<p>“COVID just accelerated the change on steroids,” he said.</p>
<p>Guarino said that Orange County and surrounding suburban markets will benefit from former urban center workers “who will never return to Manhattan.” He added that the county should also benefit from Manhattan workers who will choose to live (and work from home) in suburbs such as Orange County.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with some New York City-based executives who said they couldn’t wait to bring their workers back to their Manhattan offices, Guarino responded, “You’re going to have to wait a long time because they are not coming back.” When an executive said he was committed to bringing all of his workers back to his firm’s New York City office, Guarino told him, “No, you’re not. You are going to bring those (employees) back to Manhattan that are willing to vote to go back to work for you in Manhattan. If not, they are going to vote with their feet and work for somebody else, so you better get your head out of the clouds and get your head down to the reality that your workers are going to demand where they need to be working.”</p>
<p>These trends portend an emerging hybrid work environment that will feature both on-site and work-at-home employees. Guarino estimated that many workers will spend 30% at their urban location and 70% of the time working from home. He noted that recent studies suggest 75% of workers displaced by COVID prefer working at home with only 25% wanting to return to their offices.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day this is a perfect storm leading to urban workers moving to suburban markets in greater numbers than previously,” he predicted.</p>
<p>This hybrid work model should drive talent to Orange County, bolster the new home construction market and be a “huge driver” for the overall economy.</p>
<p>Guarino is Vice Chairman of Korn Ferry’s CEO and Board Services practice. He currently leads major consulting initiatives across industries, and has deep expertise in the global financial markets. Guarino launched the firm’s Execution Accelerator initiative; helping business leaders better execute their strategies. He also leads senior executive search and C-suite succession assignments for large Fortune 500 companies, as well as cutting edge Fintech companies within capital markets, asset and wealth management and digital assets.</p>
<p>The program also featured comments from Orange County Partnership Chairman Michael Gilfeather, Orange County President and CEO Maureen Halahan and Orange County Executive Neuhaus.</p>
<p>Gilfeather, who is president and CEO of Orange Bank &amp; Trust Co., said that in spite of the pandemic, the bank’s loan pipeline has never been larger. Neuhaus discussed the recently passed county budget and county government’s response to COVID-19. He said that while cases are rising, with the vaccines nearing distribution, the county is poised to get through the pandemic. He said that once the pandemic subsides in the spring and summer of 2021, the county and the Port Authority will begin talks to lure back JetBlue and American Airlines to New York Stewart International Airport. He noted that despite a steep drop in passenger air traffic, air cargo business at the airport is very strong. Neuhaus also said that tourism is a growing sector of the county’s economy and cited a number of film projects at various locations in the county.</p>
<p>Halahan related that thus far in 2020, the Orange County Partnership helped create 1,489 new jobs, involving 3.1 million square feet of new development and $231 million in investment.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[However, aside from NAR’s interpretations and NAR’s case interpretations, no singular Professional Standards interpretation is binding on any other Professional Standards hearing panel and they are free to interpret these provisions as they deem necessary.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Before we begin, it is important to understand that only NAR is authorized to interpret the Code of Ethics, its applications, and its proper enforcement to Member Boards and Board Members. Professional Standard hearing panels rely on these interpretations, as well as NAR’s case interpretations in forming their decisions. No other body, state association, local board, person or attorney is authorized to interpret the Code, including myself. Where NAR is silent on an issue and no guidance is provided, Realtors are free to interpret what they believe to be the correct meaning.</p>
<p>However, aside from NAR’s interpretations and NAR’s case interpretations, no singular Professional Standards interpretation is binding on any other Professional Standards hearing panel and they are free to interpret these provisions as they deem necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Offers</strong></p>
<p>Article 1, Standard of Practice 1-15 states:</p>
<p><em>Realtors, in response to inquiries from buyers or cooperating brokers shall, with the sellers’ approval, disclose the existence of offers on the property. Where disclosure is authorized, Realtors shall also disclose, if asked, whether offers were obtained by the listing licensee, another licensee in the listing firm, or by a cooperating broker. </em>(Adopted 1/03, Amended 1/09).</p>
<p>First and foremost, this provision applies to only offers that have been presented. It does not apply to offers that have been accepted. As we will see, accepted offers are treated differently.</p>
<p>Second, this Standard of Practice indicates that the power to disclose if there are any offers resides in the seller, not the Realtor. Only the client can decide whether they will or will not permit the disclosure of offers on the property. The Realtor has no say in the matter and he/she must ask the homeowner if it is permissible to disclose the existence of any offers on the property (if it hasn’t already been done in advance). Best practices would dictate that the Realtor should sit down with his/her client and explain the pros and cons of the disclosure of offers to other Realtors.</p>
<p>Finally, if disclosure is authorized, if the Realtor asks, then the agency source of the offer should be disclosed as well.</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Offers</strong></p>
<p>Article 3, Standard of Practice 3-6 states:</p>
<p><em>Realtors shall disclose the existence of accepted offers, including offers with unresolved contingencies, to any broker seeking cooperation</em>. (Adopted 5/86, Amended 1/04).</p>
<p>A plain reading of this Standard of Practice would be that once an offer is accepted, the listing Realtor must disclose its existence. While it does not say how or when this message is to be conveyed, best practices would dictate that it be done at the first substantive contact and be done in writing in order to provide proof of presentation.</p>
<p>The bigger challenge comes when trying to determine what “accepted” means. The following are some of the definitions:</p>
<p>• To receive willingly;</p>
<p>• To give admittance or approval;</p>
<p>• To make a favorable response;</p>
<p>• Two parties agree to the terms of a contract;</p>
<p>• Agreement with the belief in an idea, opinion or explanation;</p>
<p>• The action or process of being received as adequate or suitable;</p>
<p>• The creation of a binding contract by speaking or acting in agreement with an offer and its suggested or required terms;</p>
<p>• A contract or lawful pact made between two groups or individuals and</p>
<p>• An agreement to be subject to the terms stated in the offer.</p>
<p>The common business practice and understanding of the term “accepted” in our area is that an accepted offer is a meeting of the minds between a buyer and a seller and their mutual agreement to work together in a concerted effort to consummate a contract of sale. This agreement is a promise to try to resolve all contingencies and get to the closing table. Unfortunately, other regions (for instance, north of Albany) and other professionals assert that, because of the Statute of Frauds and the requirement of a writing for all real estate transactions, an acceptance can only be acknowledged when a fully executed writing exists (i.e. a contract of sale). Further muddying the water are those agents that assert that an offer is “acceptable” but not “accepted,” meaning that the seller likes the terms but is not fully committed to it, or the agent that asserts that an offer is “accepted” once certain specific elements are satisfied.</p>
<p>This issue often arises in a Professional Standards hearing when one party asserts that they were not notified of an “accepted” offer. The other party responds that the offer was never really “accepted” so there was no duty to disclose it. Another way this issue comes about is when one party accepts one buyer’s offer, and then accepts a second offer from another buyer, leaving the first buyer in the lurch and the buyer’s agents angry, asserting that they didn’t disclose the accepted offer. This leaves the Professional Standards panel to determine on a case-by-case basis what an “accepted” offer means.</p>
<p>While we can find some reassurance in the common business practice and understanding of the term “accepted” in our region, this is not a certainty. When confronted with the situation of whether an offer is accepted, the best practice would be to ask the agent what his/her client deems to be an accepted offer, as it is the client that determines when an offer is/is not accepted. Also, in an effort to avoid being hailed in front of a Professional Standards panel, it would be the best practice to be open and transparent regarding all “accepted” offers and disclose early on what that entails.</p>
<p>As I noted in the beginning of this article, only NAR and the case interpretations can guide us on this issue and until such time that NAR comes down with a strong interpretation of what “accepted” means, each Realtor, broker, and Professional Standards panel are left to ponder the true meaning of the term. Until then, we all must be wary, inquisitive, transparent, and methodical about the making and accepting of offers. Otherwise, a Realtor may find themselves sitting before a tribunal more often than they find themselves sitting at a closing table.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives on Dec. 8 passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 on a bipartisan vote, which includes Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney’s (NY-18) provision permanently banning the establishment of new anchorages for oil barges on the lower Hudson River, from Yonkers to Kingston.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for the Hudson Valley. I promised to ban oil barges from anchoring on the lower Hudson River, and I’m proud to announce today that this ban was officially passed through the House of Representatives with broad, bipartisan support,” said Rep. Maloney. “We are the gatekeepers of the Hudson River, and it’s up to us to be good stewards of the river so New Yorkers can enjoy it for generations to come. I look forward to this provision passing the Senate, and urge the president to sign this bill into law.”</p>
<p>Representative Maloney has been a longtime champion of the effort to ban anchorage sites on the Hudson River. For years, he worked alongside local communities, elected officials from both parties, and environmental groups in the Hudson Valley to kill a proposal to install ten new anchorage sites on the Hudson River from Yonkers to Kingston, including 42 long-term berths which would be used for oil storage. Last Congress, he championed an amendment defunding future attempts to establish new anchorage sites through 2018 and introduced the Hudson River Protection Act, which would prohibit new anchorage sites within five miles of an existing superfund site, a nuclear power plant, a site on the national register of historic places, or a critical habitat of an endangered species.</p>
<p>In his role as Chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Rep. Maloney authored a provision to permanently ban the establishment of new anchorages along the Hudson River between Kingston and Yonkers. This provision was included in the Elijah E. Cummings Coast Guard Authorization Act, which authorizes funds and sets policy for the United States Coast Guard and Federal Maritime Commission and was attached to the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer issued a statement heralding the House’s passage of U.S. Rep. Maloney’s bill to permanently ban oil barge anchorages on the Lower Hudson River. “This is a major step forward for the continued fight for a clean Hudson River,” Latimer said. “The placement of massive oil-tanker parking stations along our riverfronts would lead to increased river traffic, the degradation of our efforts to enhance the space for economic and environmental purposes and create a sitting environmental disaster waiting to happen.”</p>
<p>The House of Representatives earlier this month also passed the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act, which contained three provisions U.S. Rep. Maloney championed. The bill includes the Dam Safety Improvement Act, a provision to advance the New York New Jersey Harbor &amp; Tributaries project under the Hudson River Climate Change Protection Act, as well as a provision to prioritize flood risk management projects on the Rondout Creek-Wallkill River Watershed.</p>
<p>The legislation will support the Hudson Valley ecosystem and improve New York’s water infrastructure, Rep. Maloney stated.</p>
<p>“It’s our job to protect the Hudson River and our river communities—not just today, but for future generations of New Yorkers,” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. “I’m proud that bills and provisions I authored and championed were included in this strong bipartisan package, and will continue to fight for more projects that respond to the threat of climate change, improve our water infrastructure, and protect our river communities and farmers.”</p>
<p>The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is a legislative package that authorizes studies and projects within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Civil Works mission areas, including: navigation; flood, hurricane, storm damage reduction; shoreline protection and ecosystem restoration.</p>
<p>The Dam Safety Improvement Act builds on the success of the High-Hazard Dam Rehabilitation Program by expanding eligibility of funds for the repair and rehabilitation of high-hazard dams. This important program was created by Rep. Maloney’s Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act, which was signed into law in 2016. New York State has the eighth most high-hazard dams in the country totaling 403, with nearly 100 of those dams in the Hudson Valley. The average age of America’s 90,000+ dams is 56 years old. Maintaining this critical infrastructure will save lives.</p>
<p>The Hudson River Climate Change Protection Act will help address the local impact of rising sea-levels and low-frequency precipitation by authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to study both this threat, and the threat of hurricane damage in coastal communities throughout the country. According to the federal U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), sea levels along the coasts of New York State have risen by about 13 inches since 1880, and are projected to rise another one-foot -to-4 feet by 2100. Rising sea levels will increase the frequency and severity of flooding, putting communities and coastal ecosystems along the Hudson River, an extension of the Atlantic Ocean, at risk. The New York New Jersey Harbor &amp; Tributaries project (NYNJHATS) is designed to help protect New York from catastrophic storm damage, and design measures to manage future flood risk in ways that are effective and sustainable.</p>
<p>Under this bill, the Rondout Creek-Wallkill River Watershed flood reduction project will be prioritized and expedited by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Rep. Maloney has fought for years to secure funds for Orange County farmers and communities along the Wallkill River impacted by frequent flooding and erosion, and improve infrastructure impacted by frequent flooding.</p>
<p>Rep. Maloney serves on the Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee, and is the Chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. He has been a long-time champion of environmental protection measures and has worked to protect and improve infrastructure in river communities up and down the Hudson River.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On April 3, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo “enacted the strongest Paid Sick Leave program in the nation” by passing Section 196-b of the New York State Labor Law (“Section 196-b”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/39Xk9T6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39Xk9T6</a>]. Proposed regulations have also been issued [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/37TW4d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/37TW4d2</a>] (“Regulations”). Section 196-b, and its accompanying regulations, will certainly affect both employers and employees significantly, particularly during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Section 196-b takes full effect on Jan. 1, 2021. While the effective date is January 1st, it is important to note that the “accrual” element of Section 196-b (the provision by which employers are required to calculate the amount of sick time employees are entitled to) actually began on Sept. 1, 2020. It is important for all employers, including all real estate brokerage firms who employ W-2 employees, to be aware of the requirements of this new legislation. And, although the new law generally does not apply to real estate salespersons, associate brokers, and brokers who are engaged as independent contractors, it does apply to individuals who employ their own W-2 employees (e.g. assistants, bookkeepers, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility and The Amount of Sick Leave Required to be Provided to Employees</strong></p>
<p>According to New York State [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/33UVJ8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/33UVJ8Q</a>], “all private-sector employees in New York State are covered, regardless of industry, occupation, part-time status, and overtime exempt status. Federal, state, and local government employees are<b> </b>not covered, but employees of charter schools, private schools, and not-for-profit corporations are covered.”</p>
<p>Under Section 196-b, Section 1.a., every employer will be required to provide sick leave of some sort, whether paid or unpaid. While most employers will be required to provide paid sick leave, those employing four or less employees are only required to provide “…up to forty (40) hours of unpaid sick leave in each calendar year.” However, if the employer employs four or less employees but has net income in excess of $1,000,000 in the previous calendar year, the employer would be required to provide forty (40) hours of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>Below are additional requirements under Section 1.b. and 1.c. as they relate to the amount of paid sick leave required for varying employee counts [see <a href="https://bit.ly/39Xk9T6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39Xk9T6</a>],</p>
<p>“b. For employers with between five [5] and ninety-nine [99] employees in any calendar year, shall be provided with up to forty [40] hours of paid sick leave.”</p>
<p>“c. For employers with one hundred [100] or more employees in any one calendar year, each employee shall be provided with up to fifty-six [56] hours of paid sick leave each calendar year.”</p>
<p>Section 196-1.4(a) of the Regulations provides some additional clarification regarding employee counts. Under Section 196-1.4(a) “…the number of employees employed by an employer during a calendar year shall be determined by counting the highest total number of employees concurrently employed at any point during the calendar year to date.” Therefore, if the employee count falls below a specified amount provided for under Section 196-b during a calendar year it would not permit an employer to reduce the amount of paid or unpaid sick time based on the reduction. The lower employee count can be only be used for purposes of the following calendar year, or other regular, 12-month period utilized by the employer. However, if the employee count increases during a calendar, and an employer is subject to the higher requirements under Section 196-b, the accrual calculations would begin prospectively from that point on, and any sick time accrued previously would remain the same.</p>
<p><strong>How &amp; When Do Employees Accrue Paid Sick Leave?</strong></p>
<p>While Section 196-b goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2021, employees have already begun to accrue paid sick leave starting on Sept. 1, 2020. According to Section 196-b, Section 3, “employees shall accrue sick leave at a rate of not less than one [1] hour per every thirty [30] hours worked, beginning at the commencement of employment or the effective date of this section.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Section 2 allows employers to choose to provide the full amount of applicable sick leave at the beginning of each calendar year, or other regular one-year period that the employer utilizes, however, once the employer provides the amount of the sick leave up front, it is not then permitted to “…reduce or revoke any such sick leave based on the number of hours actually worked by an employee during the calendar year…” or other 12-month period utilized by the employer. Employers must revisit their paid/unpaid sick leave policies before January 1st and modify, as necessary.</p>
<p>Section 6 of Section 196-b further provides that “an employee&#8217;s unused sick leave shall be carried over to the following calendar year, provided, however, that: (i) an employer with fewer than 100 employees may limit the use of sick leave to 40 hours per calendar year; and (ii) an employer with one hundred or more employees may limit the use of sick leave to 56 hours per calendar year.” However, if an employee is terminated, or if the employee resigns, retires or leaves the company then the employer is not required to pay the employee for unused sick pay.</p>
<p><strong>Employee’s Expanded Permitted Uses for Paid Sick Leave</strong></p>
<p>Under Section 4.a., employees are permitted to use their sick days for the common reasons, but the law further expands the scope. Below is a list of permitted uses:</p>
<p>“(i) for a mental or physical, injury, or health condition of such employee or such employee’s family member, regardless of whether such illness, injury, or health condition has been diagnosed or requires medical care at the time such employee requests such leave;</p>
<p>(ii) for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition of, or need for medical diagnosis of, or preventive care for, such employee or such employee’s family member;</p>
<p>(iii) for an absence from work due to any of the following reasons when the employee or employee’s family member has been the victim of domestic violence…, a family offense, sexual offense, stalking or human trafficking:</p>
<p>(a) to obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, rape crisis, or other services program;</p>
<p>(b) to participate in family planning, temporarily or permanently relocate, or take other actions to increase the safety of the employee or employee’s family members;</p>
<p>(c) to meet with an attorney or other social services provider to obtain information and advice on, and prepare for or participate in any criminal or civil proceeding;</p>
<p>(d) to file a complaint or domestic violence incident report with law enforcement;</p>
<p>(e) to meet with a district attorney’s office;</p>
<p>(f) to enroll children in a new school; or</p>
<p>(g) to take any other actions necessary to ensure the health or safety of the employee or the employee’s family member or to protect those who associate or work with the employee.”</p>
<p>Section 196-b also provides an expanded definition of “family member,” which includes “…an employee’s child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, sibling, grandchild or grandparent; and the child or parent of an employee’s spouse or domestic partner.” It also goes on to clarify the definitions of a child and a parent. Employers must be aware of these expanded definitions.</p>
<p><strong>What Types of Documentation May an Employer Request?</strong></p>
<p>According to Section 196-1.3(a), an employer is not permitted to require an employee to provide “…medical or other verification in connection with sick leave that lasts less than three consecutive previously scheduled workdays or shifts.” Section 196-1.3(b) also prohibits an employer from requiring or causing an employee to incur any costs or fees in order to obtain such “…medical or other verification of eligibility for use of sick leave.”</p>
<p>Section 196-1.3(c) prohibits employers from requesting confidential information, such as “…the nature of an illness, its prognosis, treatment, or other related information, nor shall any employer require any details or information regarding leave taken pursuant to Section 196-b(4)(a)(iii) of the Labor Law (otherwise known as safe leave).” Additionally, “an employer may not require that the attestation explain the nature of the illness or details related to domestic violence, sexual offense, family offense, human trafficking, or stalking that necessitates the use of safe leave.” Section 196-1.3(d) does allow an employer to request certain limited documentation. In the event an employee uses sick leave for three (3) or more days, then an employer may request the following:</p>
<p>“(1) An attestation from a licensed medical provider supporting the existence of a need for sick leave, the amount of leave needed and a date that the employee may return to work, or</p>
<p>(2) An attestation from an employee of their eligibility to leave.”</p>
<p><strong>Retaliation and Record-Keeping Requirements of Employers</strong></p>
<p>An employer is strictly prohibited from retaliating against an employee as a result of an employee exercising employee’s rights under Section 196-b. Section 7 specifically provides that, “[n]o employer or his or her agent, or the officer or agent of any corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, or any other person, shall discharge, threaten, penalize, or in any other manner discriminate or retaliate against any employee because such employee has exercised his or her rights afforded under this section, including, but not limited to, requesting sick leave and using sick leave….” It recommended that any employee who believes that he or she has been retaliated against should contact the Department of Labor’s Anti-Retaliation Unit at 888-52-LABOR or <a href="mailto:LSAsk@labor.ny.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSAsk@labor.ny.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Under the New York State Labor Law, employers are required to maintain payroll records for six (6) years, and this now includes the maintenance of records reflecting the amount of sick leave accrued and used by each employee on a weekly basis. Section 11 of Section 196-b further requires that “upon the oral or written request of an employee, an employer shall provide a summary of the amounts of sick leave accrued and used by such employee in the current calendar year and/or any previous calendar year. The employer shall provide such information to the employee within three business days of such request.” It is important for employers to have this information readily available so as to avoid any violations under the new law.</p>
<p><strong>Violation of Section 196-b by Employers</strong></p>
<p>According to the FAQ’s [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/36Z7JIq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/36Z7JIq</a>], if employers fail to provide paid sick leave to an employee in violation of Section 196-b they “…may be subject to civil/administrative actions and/or criminal penalties, including but not limited to, an order assessing the full amount of the wage underpayment, 100% liquidated damages and civil penalties in an amount up to double the total amount to be due.” Violations can be costly and onerous on an employer, especially if the employer is required to engage legal counsel to defend itself.</p>
<p>It is recommended that all employers with questions regarding Section 196-b and the accompanying regulations reach out to employment law counsel or its payroll administrators for guidance. It will be likely now more than ever that employers and employees will be affected by Section 196-b in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Therefore, it is important that employees and employers know their rights, duties and obligations under this new law.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—National and regional real estate and economic experts are in unison that the housing and some sectors of the commercial real estate markets, in spite of and in some cases due to COVID-19, will continue to rebound from the early days of the pandemic next year.</p>
<p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors officials and area real estate and business executives recently participated in a roundtable program hosted by the Business Council of Westchester where they offered assessments of the current markets and how they expect the housing and commercial sectors to perform in 2021. In addition, the National Association of Realtors staged a roundtable event earlier this month where it released its consensus forecast on the Gross Domestic Product, employment and housing prices in the coming year.</p>
<p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty said that conditions have markedly improved since the onset of the pandemic when the real estate industry was all but shut down by New York State in the hopes to prevent the spread of the virus. Since restrictions were lifted on in-person showings and home closings on June 9, the real estate market has been extremely active in the New York suburbs.</p>
<p>“What’s changed (since restrictions were lifted) is everybody is on a grand exodus out of the city,&#8221; said Haggerty, who is also president and chief strategic growth officer of OneKey MLS. “If you were to ask me in April or May would we be recovering in the residential resale area, I would have said, ‘If we get back to being flat or single-digit numbers I would be happy.’ That didn’t happen. We came roaring back.” He noted that the Westchester real estate market was strong in the first quarter and then saw single-family home sales decline by 22% in the second quarter due to the COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>“When agents were able to show properties in June, the market took off and quite frankly in a way that surprised me,” Haggerty said. “We have not totally recovered from the dip in the second quarter but it looks like if you are looking solely at single-family homes we will be about 10% above last year (at the end of 2020).”</p>
<p>“I think throughout the suburban (NYC) area, 2021 is going to be very bullish,” Haggerty predicted. “Home has taken on a whole new meaning with COVID and especially with single-family homes.” He noted that condo and co-op sales since COVID emerged have been flat, adding that condo and co-op owners in Manhattan are not looking to buy the same product in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Sarah Jones-Maturo, president of commercial brokerage firm RM Friedland, said that there is tremendous demand for residential development sites in Westchester, particularly in locations in Hastings-on-Hudson, Pleasantville and other non-transit-oriented development properties in the county. She said that among the interested investors include urban developers that previously considered only TOD locations.</p>
<p>In terms of her thoughts for the commercial markets in 2021, she believes that a return to experiential retail and a move back to corporate offices will begin in the summer of 2021. She did note that in terms of office usage, a “new normal” will emerge as remote work programs are here to stay.</p>
<p>“I think we are going to have to evolve,” she said. “By June, July of 2021 things are going to be somewhat normal again.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the National Association of Realtors reported that a group of experts predicted GDP growth of 3.5% and an annual unemployment rate of 6.2% in 2021. In 2020, home sales will reach 5.52 million, the highest annual mark since 2006, with the median home price setting a record high of $293,000, according to NAR.</p>
<p>Housing prices are expected to climb 8.0% next year and 5.5% in 2022, with 30-year fixed mortgage rates of 3.0% and 3.25% for 2021 and 2022, respectively, NAR reported.</p>
<p>The share of the U.S. workforce working from home will decline to 18% in 2021—down from 21% in 2020. The experts predict small declines in office and hotel vacancy rates in 2021, with a slight increase in retail vacancies next year.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As the region enters 2021 with the specter of possible further economic restrictions due to rising coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths, but with the hope of improving conditions now that COVID-19 vaccines are starting to be administered, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> turned to a well-known and longtime successful commercial investor—Robert Weisz—for some much-needed perspective.</p>
<p>Commercial real estate organizations, such as the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) and the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ Commercial Investment Division, have frequently turned to Weisz for his insights and prognostications concerning the suburban commercial markets, particularly during uncertain economic times.</p>
<p>Robert Weisz, a native of Montevideo, Uruguay, has made a name for himself in the New York metro region’s commercial real estate market for his talent for engaging in the acquisition, repositioning and/or redevelopment of outdated properties.</p>
<p>Weisz arrived in the United States in January 1977 and started a career in the furniture industry. In 1979, he purchased his first warehouse to house his furniture company; and by 1980, was intent on creating his own commercial real estate business, RPW Group. He has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the firm, now based in Rye Brook, since its founding.</p>
<p>The son of a furniture maker, Weisz’ crowning achievement is likely the acquisition in 2004 and the later conversion of the former 625,000-square-foot General Foods/Kraft/Philip Morris property in Rye Brook (nicknamed by some as Westchester County’s “Taj Mahal”) from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant property. Recently, he embarked on the long-awaited mixed-use development project adjacent to his 1133 Westchester Ave. commercial property (a former IBM office building) in White Plains off I-287.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/March-CID-Meeting-11331-e1458590710287-1024x683.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-34834" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/March-CID-Meeting-11331-e1458590710287-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Weisz has been the recipient of numerous recognitions as well as receiving an Honorary Doctorate Degree of Commercial Science from Mercy College in 2014. He has also served as a member of the Board of Directors of Westchester County Association, Reaching U and the Inner-City Scholarship Fund of the Archdiocese of New York City.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: Your firm has been involved for decades acquiring and repositioning real estate assets? I would think your firm&#8217;s shining achievement was the repositioning of the former Philip Morris property at 800 Westchester Ave. in Rye Brook. If you agree, what attracted you to the property and explain how you saw what no one else did at the time in converting the former single-tenant property into a thriving multi-tenanted building?</p>
<p><strong>Weisz</strong>: I will agree that was one of the most exciting, if not the most exciting repositioning we have done. And I would probably without being too modest, say it was the most exciting repositioning in Westchester County of any office building. The reason for that is 800 Westchester (Ave.) is a very unusual building. It’s a million square feet cover and has a great deal of non-rentable space and at the time we bought it, it was going to be very difficult to make it a multi-tenant building. It was always designed and used as a single-tenant building and worked as such for a long time. It was originally built for General Foods and then Philip Morris bought it and they had several of their different companies in the building. The main reason why we were excited was because it is a very unusual piece of architecture. Most people love it. Some people hate it, but it really makes a statement. At the time in 2004 when we purchased the building, what was happening at the time was there were not large multi-tenant buildings of that size. We had done a number of buildings (re-positionings) by then—20 or 30—but the average size was 100,000 square feet, 150,000 square feet. Two-hundred thousand square feet was a very large building. In 800 Westchester Ave. we have over 100,000 square feet of amenities—space that is not being rented. So, that can only be accomplished with a building of a substantial size like this.</p>
<p>In a nutshell our bet was that small companies would like to offer their staff the same treatment that Fortune 500 companies offer their employees. What I mean by that is to have a great cafeteria with a lot of selection, to have an executive dining room, a bank branch, a great fitness center—we have two squash courts—to have a beauty parlor, a sundry shop, a dry cleaner and a conference center with room for over 100 people. So, all these things were not offered in any multi-tenanted building at the time. I would think that 800 (Westchester Ave.) was probably the first one. The conclusion was when we did it, we rented the entire building in two years. So, obviously our bet was a good bet at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: Prior to the pandemic, you were pretty bullish on the future of the Westchester County commercial real estate market. At a meeting in early 2020 you said, “I predict that the next five to 10 years are going to be the most successful period that Westchester has seen probably in the last 50 years.” With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, how has the Westchester County market changed and has that altered your upbeat view of the market in the years ahead?</p>
<p><strong>Weisz</strong>: Prior to the pandemic, New York City for obvious reasons, was the magnet of the Northeast, the country and probably the world. And the areas around New York City had been expanding, starting with Brooklyn. You remember Brooklyn was a dirty word and now Brooklyn symbolizes high rent, great quality of life, wonderful quality of apartments, retail, etc. That has been transported to Long Island City in Queens and has moved to the Bronx and in the last five to 10 years started to percolate into Westchester County—and has continued to do so in a very strong way.</p>
<p>So, with the Millennials now getting married and having children, we see the movement from the major cities to the suburbs and there is no better suburb than Westchester County around New York City. It has the best quality of life, best transportation, the best school system—not Long Island, not New Jersey, Westchester is number one for obvious reasons. When it comes to the quality of housing, the cost of a house, Westchester offers the absolute best. What was missing in Westchester and a problem was it was not allowing young families and single-people to live in the area because it did not have good, competitive rental apartments that people could afford and have a good quality of life. That has been changing. Westchester in the last few years has added several thousand units and in the next five to 10 years we are talking another 5,000 to 10,000 units.</p>
<p>With the onset of COVID-19, everything I just described has intensified dramatically. People who have never, ever stepped foot outside of New York City, they are now living in the suburbs. I talk to my adult children who tell <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/March-of-Dimes-Awards-e1450381783254-1024x683.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-34833" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/March-of-Dimes-Awards-e1450381783254-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>me their friends who never had a driver’s license, they are buying cars because they are all moving to the suburbs. Is this going to be permanent? No, there is going to be a percentage that will be coming back (to the city). What I am describing, was happening already without COVID. The coronavirus just multiplied and intensified (those trends). Let me give you a very concrete example. A friend of mine lives in New York City and grew up in the suburbs. He decided to rent a house last summer (during the COVID crisis) in Westchester. The house he was looking at was a house no one would rent (prior to the pandemic) for $6,000 or $7,000 a month. He rented it last summer and he paid $27,000 a month because there was nothing available. Every house he tried to rent was rented before he had a chance to put an offer in. So, that tells you the intensity of the demand, which has been completely out of control, is going to stay intense, but won’t be out of control (going forward).</p>
<p>This is taking place in combination with all the businesses and companies that are setting foot in Westchester and the businesses in Westchester that are expanding and growing dramatically for a number of different reasons…</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: While many New York City residents have at least temporarily left the city for the suburbs, the same cannot be said for businesses in the city. For years, commercial market reports predicted higher rents and large relocations from New York City and for the most part that didn’t happen. Why do you think Westchester has not benefitted nearly as much as some had predicted?</p>
<p><strong>Weisz</strong>: The main reason for that is New York City was overbuilt long before everyone else. Outside of New York City, Westchester was the place that had this incredible amount of construction—30 million to 40 million square feet (of commercial office space) were built and then when companies started to change their practices—the typical corporate headquarters in the country used to be 1,000 to 2,000 people, then in the 70’s the companies decided to separate the back office and front office and kept their headquarters in the region, usually with an average of 100 to 150 people. Everything else became back office and went south to different regions where the cost of living was much lower. When that happened, we had a lot of what we called “see-through buildings” and buildings that became completely empty. We purchased probably a dozen of those that were former headquarters of different companies and the market completely crashed. Then in the early 2000s, it slowly started to come back.</p>
<p>Now, a number of things are happening at the same time. Most municipalities have changed their building codes and allowing high density housing where it was not allowed before… <strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Weisz noted the changing skylines over the years in White Plains, New Rochelle and Yonkers and related that 3 million to 4 million square feet of outdated commercial office buildings have been converted to other uses.</p>
<p>By having more residential, affordable housing in the region, you can have a better workforce in the region and supply all these existing or expanding businesses in Westchester. There are also a number of new areas of business that were not prevalent in Westchester (previously)—Biotechnology for example. You have a company like Regeneron that employs thousands of people in Westchester and all of the companies it is related to as well. We have an explosion of medical needs and medical providers…</p>
<p>We believe that when the dust settles, there is going to be a slightly different approach where companies will look at the region rather than just the heart of New York City.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Weisz-CID1-2009.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34836 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Weisz-CID1-2009.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" /></a>Editor’s Note:</strong> Weisz said that even though since the onset of the coronavirus, large companies have not relocated to Westchester County, RPW Group has signed 10 long-term lease deals since the pandemic began with New York City based companies that have averaged between 5,000 to 10,000 square feet.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With changes in priorities by New York City renters in response to COVID-19, are you concerned that some city renters will forego moving to Westchester apartment buildings, thus depressing demand for new county multifamily product coming online?</p>
<p><strong>Weisz</strong>: The reality is No. The (prospective) renters in Westchester are families with children that will be moving to the suburbs no matter what. You have the empty nesters that do not want to take care of the big homes anymore and I think that process was happening before and I don’t think it is going to stop now… We are just scratching the surface (on demand) with 5,000 units. There is a long way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth</strong>: You are moving forward with a partner on a long-awaited project at your 1133 Westchester Ave. property in White Plains. Can you explain what you have planned and when it might break ground?</p>
<p><strong>Weisz</strong>: We started construction six months ago (on the mixed-use project at 1133 Westchester Ave.) right in the heart of the pandemic. This is a substantial project (in partnership with NRP Group of Cleveland) on 20 acres with 300 units in three buildings with a lot of ancillary buildings, a swimming pool, barbeques and a number of other amenities. We are ready to start pouring foundations on the first building and we did all the underground work already. So that is well on its way. We think that for the spring of 2022 we should have the first residents moving in.</p>
<p>We also have 10 acres on Webb Avenue in Purchase (with partner NRP Group) and we are looking to build 200 units. It is right off Exit 10 of I-287 that is right next to 800 Westchester Ave… We have made a presentation to the Planning Board of Harrison recently and we are working through the process.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Weisz estimated the development cost of the White Plains project at $100 million and the Harrison proposal at approximately $60 million.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The see-saw year, aka 2020, ended on an astonishingly high note for real estate practitioners in the Lower Hudson Valley, according to the<a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2021/01/OneKey-MLS-4th-Qtr-2020-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> 2020 Fourth Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx counties</strong></a> released on Jan. 5 by OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>After experiencing strong first quarter sales, agents looked forward to and anticipated more of the same for the second quarter. What occurred instead was a decimated market as a result of COVID-19, and the virtual shut down of real estate activity. Creativity and technology, as well as a desire by city dwellers to escape their close environs, resulted in historically high single-family residential sales in the third quarter which, as it turns out, was only a preview of what was to occur in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Every county in the region, with the exception of the Bronx, which falls in the city category, experienced year-over-year increases in residential home sales. All regions, the Bronx included, also saw increases in median sales prices. While year-over-year increases were significant, fourth quarter increases were nothing short of dramatic.</p>
<p>Westchester, which comprises the largest market in the region, had a year-over-year increase in single-family residential sales of 14% or 6,657 units as compared to 5,839 for 2019; one third of those sales occurring in the fourth quarter of 2020. There were 2,232 single-family sales in the fourth quarter as compared to 1,415 sales in the fourth quarter of 2019, a 57% increase. Year-over-year, the median price of a single-family home in Westchester increased more than 12% to $735,000, compared to $655,000 for 2019.</p>
<p>Increases were no less impressive in other counties. Putnam County, one of the smaller markets in the region, had an annual increase in single-family sales of 20%, going from 1,050 units in 2019 to 1,261 units in 2020 with a median price increase of 6% or $380,000, as compared to $358,000 in 2019. Single-family sales in Rockland County increased 14.7% for the year, with 36% of sales taking place in the fourth quarter. Unit sales for the year were 2,327, as compared to 2,028 in 2019. The median sales price of $500,000 was an almost 10% increase over the 2019 median of $455,000.</p>
<p>Year-over-year, single-family sales in Orange County increased 8.5% to 3,984 units from 3,673 units in 2019, the highest number of single-family sales ever recorded for one year in Orange. Again, 36% of those sales took place in the fourth quarter. The median sales price in Orange increased by 19% to $330,000 from $277,250 in 2019, finally surpassing a high of $322,500 in 2007. Sullivan County, the northernmost in the region, had the highest percentage increase in sales for the year. Single-family sales of 1,232 units surpassed 2019’s number of 979 by 25.8%, with a median price increase of 36.8% to $195,000 from $142,500 in 2019.</p>
<p>Condominium unit sales were mixed, but prices increased in all markets both for the fourth quarter and year-over-year. Westchester County condo sales were down by 6.8% for the year, but showed surprising strength in the fourth quarter, increasing by 48% with an annual price increase of 5% to $404,500 from $385,000 in 2019. Condo sales were strong in Putnam, up 37.3% to 173 units from 126 units in 2019. Rockland County condo sales increased year-over-year by 7%, while prices went from $247,250 in 2019 to $265,000 in 2020. Orange County condo sales dropped almost 11% for the year, but showed some strength in the fourth quarter increasing by 10% to 151 units over the same period in 2019. Condo sales were also weak in Bronx County, dropping 14.7% in 2020 (157 units compared to 184 units in 2019).</p>
<p>Westchester and Bronx counties continued to see their co-op markets slide with a drop of 16.7% in sales in Westchester (1,559 units sold in 2020 as compared to 1,871 units in 2019) and a drop of 27% in the Bronx (391 units as compared to 537 units sold in 2019). Co-op prices rose in both counties. Multi-family (2-4 units) sales were down in all areas (with no change in Sullivan), but prices continued to increase in that category as well.</p>
<p>In general, the days a property stayed on the market (DOM) were down in all market areas and properties sold very close to, and in many instances above, list price—all indicative of a strong market.</p>
<p>The real estate market has been an anomaly in a difficult economy and future predictions for the market are difficult at best. Inventory is at an all-time low, which may negatively impact sales and put upward pressure on prices which, in turn, affect affordability. This is somewhat offset by the low interest rate environment. A higher than usual unemployment rate for the area remains a concern, but commercial activity in the lower Hudson Valley remains strong and should bode well for the residential sector. A high level of pending sales is an indication that in the near-term, sales will remain strong.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[This article will focus on the major aspects of the COVID-19 relief measures included for businesses.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Dec. 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 [see<a href="https://bit.ly/3qb3WOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/3qb3WOP</a>] which passed overwhelmingly by both the House and Senate. The Appropriations Act is the largest bill (over 5,000 pages) ever passed by Congress. It includes $900 billion in pandemic relief funds to assist businesses and provide important funding and resources for vaccination measures. This article will focus on the major aspects of the COVID-19 relief measures included for businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Updates to the Second Round of The PPP Loan Program</strong></p>
<p>The Appropriations Act expanded and modified critical aspects of the Paycheck Protection Program. <em>The Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act</em> (the “Economic Aid Act”), which was included as part of the Appropriations Act, modifies and expands the PPP Loan Program. The Economic Aid Act allows businesses to apply for a PPP Loan if they had not done so in the first round. The Economic Aid Act also allows businesses that received a PPP Loan in the first round to apply for a second draw. Additionally, it allows those businesses that did not receive their full loan amount, or returned unused funds in the first round, to request additional funding under the PPP.</p>
<p><strong>New Rules and Guidance Issued by the SBA Relating to PPP</strong></p>
<p>On Jan. 6, 2021, the Small Business Administration issued rules concerning the Economic Aid Act and the second round of PPP. Some of the notable provisions and changes as highlighted by the SBA [see <a href="https://bit.ly/2LgjJNP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2LgjJNP</a>] are as follows:</p>
<p>• PPP borrowers can set their PPP loan’s covered period to be any length between eight and 24 weeks to best meet their business needs;</p>
<p>• PPP loans will cover additional expenses, including operations expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs and worker protection expenditures;</p>
<p>• The program’s eligibility is expanded to include 501(c)(6)s, housing cooperatives, destination marketing organizations, among other types of organizations;</p>
<p>• The PPP provides greater flexibility for seasonal employees;</p>
<p>The SBA points out that the under the new Economic Aid Act, the borrower of the second draw must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>• Previously received a First Draw PPP Loan and will or has used the full amount only for authorized uses;</p>
<p>• Has no more than 300 employees; and</p>
<p>• Can demonstrate at least a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>Under the Economic Aid Act, $284.45 billion is allocated for second round PPP Loans, which loans are targeted toward borrowers in low- and moderate- income neighborhoods, smaller businesses, and those businesses most impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3i4pb1U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3i4pb1U</a>]. It also targets funding for smaller community lenders that are more likely to provide loans in these areas and to these borrowers.</p>
<p><strong>PPP Focus on Smaller, Heavily Impacted</strong><br />
<strong> And Minority-Owned Businesses</strong></p>
<p>The Economic Aid Act focuses on providing economic assistance to “…minority, underserved, veteran, and women-owned business concerns” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3i4pb1U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3i4pb1U</a>]. The SBA is undertaking a variety of steps, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>• Accept PPP loan applications only from community financial institutions for at least the first two days when the PPP loan portal re-opens;</p>
<p>• Match borrower inquiries to small lenders who can aid traditionally underserved communities;</p>
<p>• Continue setting aside dedicated hours to process and assist [the] smallest PPP lenders with their PPP loans;</p>
<p>Continue to strongly encourage …minority-, women-, veteran-, and military-owned lenders to apply to become PPP lenders. SBA will give full and prompt consideration to these applications to become PPP lenders consistent with program guidelines, including in cases where the lender does not meet all of the requirements listed on the updated SBA Form 3507 and</p>
<p>• Promote awareness of these policies and procedures via traditional media methods, SBA social media accounts and guidance to lenders before the formal opening of SBA’s loan systems.</p>
<p>The second PPP Loan Program commenced on Jan. 11, 2021 for the above categories and targeted borrowers, and commences on January 13th for all other eligible borrowers. The SBA points out in its guidance that “…minority, underserved, veteran, and women-owned businesses that encounter difficulties in obtaining a PPP Loan should contact their local SBA district office for assistance. A link on how to find an office near you can be found via www.sba.gov/local-assistance.” The second PPP Loan Program will end on March 31, 2021. Those borrowers applying for second draw PPP Loans may not borrower more than $2 million.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Eligibility Under the New PPP Loan Program</strong></p>
<p>The Economic Aid Act expanded eligibility requirements to certain not-for-profit entities, such as 501(c)(6) entities, and entities that do not receive more than 15% of their revenue from lobbying efforts. The National Association of Realtors lobbied vigorously to have 501(c)(6) entities included because most Realtor associations are 501(c)(6) not-for-profit entities and were not able to apply for assistance under the original PPP Loan Program.</p>
<p>In addition, the new law provides increased loan amounts for restaurants, hotels, and other businesses designated under the NAICS Code 72 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3oJC6sY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3oJC6sY</a>]. These entities are permitted to apply for a greater loan amount, equal to 3.5 times the amount of eligible payroll expense rather than 2.5 times.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Eligible Expenses and</strong><br />
<strong> Forgiveness Requirements Under PPP</strong></p>
<p>The Economic Aid Act also expanded the list of eligible expenses which may be paid using PPP Loan proceeds. In addition to payroll costs, covered mortgage, rent, and utility payments provided for in the CARES Act, the following additional expenses also qualify for forgiveness:</p>
<p>• Payment for software, cloud computing, human resources expenses and accounting expenses.</p>
<p>• Costs and expenses, that are not covered by insurance, related to looting and property damage caused by public disturbances during 2020.</p>
<p>• Payments to a supplier pursuant to a contract, purchase order, or order for goods in effect prior to taking out the loan that are essential to operations.</p>
<p>• Personal protective equipment and costs related to compliance with state and local requirements in connection with the health and safety guidelines relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic during the period between March 1, 2020, and the end of the national emergency declaration.</p>
<p>Borrowers are still required to use at least 60% of the loan proceeds for payroll expenses, and up to 40% toward other eligible expenses. Borrowers may now include additional group insurance costs (e.g., vision, dental, disability or life insurance) as part of their covered “payroll costs.” The borrower is also permitted to choose the “covered period” within which to spend the loan proceeds, which can be any length between eight and 24 weeks after origination of the PPP Loan. Under the CARES Act, a borrower was required to pick a fixed period of either eight weeks or 24 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Second Draw PPP Loan Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The SBA has issued a new form for borrowers applying for a second draw (SBA Form 2483-SD &#8211; Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw Borrower Application Form). The lender is also permitted to use its own form provided it is the equivalent of the SBA’s form. A borrower must contact the original lender. Many lenders are setting up portals to accept new PPP loan applications and second draw loan requests. If the payroll information has not changed since the first PPP loan, no additional payroll documentation is required. Borrowers that received a first draw do not need to submit a new application. The loan will be processed under the existing loan number.</p>
<p>In order for a borrower to qualify for a second PPP Loan, there must be a 25% reduction in revenue as compared to a “comparable 2019 quarter.&#8221; The SBA has not yet explained what exactly a “comparable 2019 quarter” is. However, since the language is broad, it seems that any three-month period (or quarter) would qualify for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>If the borrower applies for a second PPP loan greater than $150,000, the borrower would be required to provide its lender with documentation such as tax returns, or quarterly financial statements or bank statements, if tax returns are not available. For loans under $150,000, no substantiating documentation is required. The forgiveness application process is also simplified. Additionally, for PPP loans under $150,000, the borrower only needs to submit a one-page certification form, which will soon be finalized and made available by the SBA. Similar to the first PPP, borrowers will not be required to guaranty the loan as it is fully guaranteed by the SBA.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Key Aspects of the Appropriations Act</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Additional Unemployment Assistance Under CAUWA</strong></em></p>
<p>The Continued Assistance for Unemployed Workers Act of 2020 (“CAUWA”), also enacted under the Appropriations Act, modified the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance provisions enacted in the spring of 2020. Some of the notable changes include the following [see <a href="https://bit.ly/39nBZN8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39nBZN8</a>]:</p>
<p>• The Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program has been extended through March 14, 2021 (from Dec. 31, 2020).</p>
<p>• The amount of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefit has now been reduced to $300 from $600.</p>
<p>• Applicants applying on or after January 31st must provide documentation to substantiate their prior work experience.</p>
<p>• Identity confirmation procedures must be put in place by states for any applicant applying for PUA benefits.</p>
<p>• Applicants who receive both W-2 wages and self-employment income may apply for an additional $100 in weekly unemployment benefits, however, the states may opt to provide this added benefit.</p>
<p>The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation period has been increased by an additional 11 weeks for a total benefit limit of 50 weeks (increased from the 39 weeks previously approved).</p>
<p>The CAUWA requires states to implement a system for reporting those applicants who refuse to return to work or refuse to accept a reasonable offer without good cause.</p>
<p><strong><em>Employee Retention Tax Credit</em></strong></p>
<p>The Appropriations Act also extended and expands the Employee Retention Tax Credit provided for under the CARES Act. Commencing on Jan. 1, 2021 and continuing through June 30, 2021, the changes include the following:</p>
<p>• The ERTC is increased from 50% to 70% of qualified wages.</p>
<p>• Employers are required to show a year-over-year decline of gross of 20% rather than 50% and provides a safe harbor which permits employers to use prior quarter.</p>
<p>• The limit of wages that employees are allowed to receive a credit for is now $10,000 per employee for each quarter rather than $10,000 for the entire year.</p>
<p>• Eligibility is expanded to employers with 500 employees or less rather than employers with 100 employees or less.</p>
<p><strong>The Hope of a New Beginning is on the Horizon</strong></p>
<p>The Appropriations Act passed with broad bi-partisan support, however, in light of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is likely that additional COVID-19 relief may be enacted in the coming months. With the development of vaccines comes renewed hope that we are close to turning the corner. Nevertheless, the vaccines’ limited supply is still going to require individuals to continue to be extremely careful. While there is a light at the end of the tunnel, there is still a way to go.</p>
<p>The Appropriations Act, and additional financial relief, will hopefully serve as a bridge to assist those most impacted in this nearly year-long and very difficult journey for the country and the world. Many have lost their jobs and businesses, and so many have lost their lives to this virus. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all of those affected. We must not lose hope, we must continue to have the strength to get through this, we must continue to assist those in need and we must strive to reestablish some sort of normalcy once again.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With the new year upon us, we must keep in mind all the changes that took place in 2020 (although I’m sure many of us wish to forget about last year). So, in keeping with helping all members stay in compliance with various rules, regulations, and requirements, I am going to dedicate this month’s article to serve as a cheat-sheet for compliance-related matters.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nysar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LEG_2020_NYS_Advertising_Regulation_110220.pdf?utm_source=NYSAR+Master+List&utm_campaign=b7640aeace-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_03_23_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f1e488a523-b7640aeace-160875873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New advertising regulations (Section 175.25)</a></strong> went into effect on Nov. 2, 2020. For websites, all brokers and their agents that advertise an exclusive listing of another broker must now clearly and conspicuously display the name of the listing broker preceded by one of seven permitted phrases. The regulation applies to agents or brokerages that display an IDX feed on their websites. It also applies to paid advertisements through third parties. Further, if a paid advertisement is utilized, the word “advertisement” must immediately follow the name of the licensee. A copy of the amended advertising regulation can be found<strong> <a href="https://www.nysar.com/advocacy/weekly-report/amended-advertising-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong> or by going to the NYSAR website.</p>
<p>In addition to the new regulations, an agent must be reminded to remain compliant with current advertising regulations and remember that all advertising (including signs, ads, business cards, marketing pieces, blast e-mails, social media, etc.) must be approved by your broker. Things to remember include:</p>
<p><strong>General Advertising:</strong></p>
<p>• Unless given express permission, you can only advertise your own exclusive listings;</p>
<p>• Do not use someone else’s photos or description without permission;</p>
<p>• Include the brokerage name and either the full address or general office number;</p>
<p>• Include your license type.</p>
<p><strong>Business Cards:</strong></p>
<p>• Must include brokerage name, license type, brokerage address and general office phone number.</p>
<p><strong>Teams:</strong></p>
<p>• Team names shall either: (i) include the full licensed name of the real estate brokers, associate brokers or real estate salespersons who are part of said team; or (ii) if the names are not included, the team name must be immediately followed by “at/of [full name of the broker/brokerage].”</p>
<p>• Team names shall use the term “team.” The use of any other terms besides “team” is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>License Renewal/Continuing Education/NAR Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Some changes have taken place for real estate license renewal as they relate to Continuing Education, the most important of which is that brokers who were previously exempt from earning CE credit will no longer be exempt when they renew their licenses after July 1, 2021. For CE credits, timing is everything.</p>
<p><strong>License Expires BEFORE July 1, 2021:</strong></p>
<p>Must complete at least 22.5 hours of continuing education (CE) credit including:</p>
<p>• Three (3) hours of fair housing;</p>
<p>• One (1) hour of agency (two (2) hours if first license cycle);</p>
<p>• An approved Code of Ethics course every three (3) years.</p>
<p><strong>License Expires AFTER July 1, 2021:</strong></p>
<p>Must take 22.5 hours of CE credit including:</p>
<p>• Three (3) hours of fair housing;</p>
<p>• One (1) hour of agency (two hours in the first license cycle);</p>
<p>• Two-and-a-half (2.5) hours of ethical business practices (includes NAR Code of Ethics training);</p>
<p>• One (1) hour of recent legal matters (may include statutes, laws, regulations, rules, codes, DOS opinions and decisions and court decisions).</p>
<p><strong>NAR Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, all member must take two-and-a-half (2.5) hours of Code of Ethics training to remain an active member of NAR and the association. This training recently changed from a two-year cycle to a three-year cycle. The last cycle was extended to Dec. 31, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing</strong></p>
<p>New Fair Housing regulations went into effect on June 20, 2020. As a result, all Realtors must now:</p>
<p>• Provide a<strong> <a href="https://www.nysar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LEG_FH_HADDF_updated_61720-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Housing and Anti-Discrimination Disclosure</a></strong> to every consumer at first substantive contact;</p>
<p>• Post a <strong><a href="https://www.nysar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LEG_FairHousingNotice_new.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Housing and Anti-Discrimination Notice</a> </strong>at all offices and at all Open Houses as well as add a link to all webpages.</p>
<p><strong>COVID Forms</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there are no state-mandated COVID forms that must be filled out by member, clients, customers; however, some brokerages, at the direction of their clients, have established certain business practices that will require the execution of various COVID forms in order for someone to see a property. This is permissible so long as it is done in a non-discriminatory way.</p>
<p><strong>Other Forms You Should Already be Using</strong></p>
<p>Please be reminded that you are required to provide an <a href="https://www.nysar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Legal_disclosure_buyer_seller.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Agency Disclosure Form</strong></a> at first substantive contact.</p>
<p>You should also be providing a<strong><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/lesr_eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lead disclosure form</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/lead-in-your-home-portrait-color-2020-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pamphlet</a></strong> when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>No Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>As of the date of authoring this article, there is still a state of emergency in New York. As a result, real estate agents are still prohibited from making cold calls to prospective clients with whom they do not have an established relationship. This means that you cannot call a FSBO to solicit the listing. However, you may call a FSBO if you have an identifiable purchaser interested in the property.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p>NAR recently provided a release relating to the Department of Labor’s (DOL)<strong><a href="https://aboutblaw.com/UVY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> final independent contractor rule</a> </strong>which helps in clarifying the standard for employee versus independent contractor status under the <em>Fair Labor Standards Act</em>. While the current effective date of the rule is March 8, 2021, NAR believed that the Biden team will freeze this regulation upon taking office, as they believe that the new administration is more in favor of classifying workers as employees rather than independent contractors. NAR will be closely watching this as it develops.</p>
<p>NAR stated: <em>“For real estate professionals, the final rule does not change their classification as independent contractors under the Internal Revenue Code, nor does it preempt the many states laws classifying real estate professionals as independent contractors. Thus, states still need to ensure their laws adequately protect real estate professionals as independent contractors.”</em></p>
<p>NAR previously submitted comments on the proposed rule last October, primarily advocating for minimal disruption to the real estate industry. NAR supports DOL’s efforts to provide a clear and consistent standard for evaluating a worker’s status, while preserving existing worker classification authority that allows real estate professionals to be independent contractors.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Most readers of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> may not know Bart D’Andrea, but people have been seeing his work every month for the past 43 years. The graphic designer responsible for creating the look and feel of the association’s award-winning newspaper is also an accomplished artist, author, college professor, lecturer, Chi Gong instructor and former U.S. Marine sergeant.</p>
<p>D’Andrea’s artwork has been featured at showings throughout the tri-state area, and he has taught graphic design for more than 17 years at New York University in Manhattan, as well as other colleges and schools. He is also the founder of Meadow Art and Design Studio, based in New Jersey, and over the past 40 years, he has designed newspapers, brochures, books, catalogs, advertising, and even graphic panels for custom designed helicopters. He counts MasterCard as one of his many corporate clients.</p>
<p>D’Andrea began his association with the former Westchester County Board of Realtors in 1978, starting with the design of <em>Westchester Realtor</em>, the forerunner of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. “Back then, the publication had no color photos and was more or less just about the Realtors, with no hard or breaking news,” he recalled. “When John Jordan came on as editor, all of that changed.”</p>
<p>The two worked together with former Association CEO Gil Mercurio, to redesign the newspaper and add breaking news stories not only about real estate, but on legislation affecting the industry, as well as regional and national trends. Real Estate in Depth was officially launched in 1996.</p>
<p>“John and I hit it off immediately,” said D’Andrea. “He was incredibly professional and his writing ability completely elevated the newspaper. I never had an editor like him. When an editor and art director can actually talk to each other, that’s a good thing!”</p>
<p>D’Andrea grew up in northern New Jersey and served as a sergeant with the U.S. Marine Corps from 1964 to 1970. After graduating with an M.A. in Fine Art from Montclair State University in 1976, D’Andrea worked with several clients before starting his own business. One of his biggest was MasterCard, for which he designed all of their training and operations manuals. Another notable client was King’s Food Markets, which serves the tri-state area. The logos D’Andrea designed are still being used today.</p>
<p>His wife, Sylvia, is also his business partner. The two met years ago in Florida, while they were both on vacation. Forty-seven years later, they’re still together. “Not only are we married but we also work together every day, so I guess it worked out OK,” he laughed.</p>
<div id="attachment_35102" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RedDancers2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35102" class="wp-image-35102" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RedDancers2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="275" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-35102" class="wp-caption-text">Bart D’Andrea &#8220;Red Dancers&#8221;, 40&#8243; x 60&#8243; enamel on canvas.</p></div>
<p>Over the years he has also shared his knowledge of art and graphic design as an adjunct professor with New York University in Manhattan, State University of New York/ Kingsborough College in Brooklyn, Bergen Community College in Paramus, and many others. “My biggest enjoyment is teaching,” he said. “I’m actually most comfortable being in front of a group of people.”</p>
<p>The author of “An Artist’s Opinion,” D’Andrea has judged art shows and given lectures at various organizations, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Guggenheim Museum, and MoMA. He has spoken to artists and business groups on more than 65 different artists and art movements. “I’ve talked about everything from ancient cave paintings to modern art,” he noted.</p>
<p>In fact, his “man cave” in his Princeton, NJ home’s basement serves as his personal art gallery, featuring his own works. A Picasso fan, D’Andrea’s art work consists of abstract and expressionism paintings, as well as some sculptures. His work has been on display at the Kotinsky Gallery in Pompton Lakes, NJ, the Westchester County Center in White Plains, the Bishop House in Saddle River, NJ, the Gotham Gallery in Manhattan, and many other locations.</p>
<p>D’Andrea credits the practice of Chi Gong, the precursor to Tai Chi, with keeping him so focused with his many endeavors. Now a Certified Advanced Level Four Chi Gong Instructor, he practices every morning to keep both body and mind in shape. “I first started doing Chi Cong after leaving the military as a way of working out every day,” he remembered. “It’s an energy flow throughout the body, and while it’s slow and methodical, it’s very beneficial”</p>
<p>Chi Gong, dating back more than 5,000 years ago in China, is known for rejuvenating the body and mind and is used by some five million people in the U.S. alone. “You do feel differently afterward, but it doesn’t happen overnight,” explained D’Andrea. “I think it’s been especially helpful during this pandemic. A lot of people often equate it to standing meditation.”</p>
<p>Chi Gong has also helped to make 43 years of newspaper design seem like something new every time. “It’s such a fun thing to do for me,” said D’Andrea. “I enjoy taking all of the elements of a page and putting it together.”</p>
<p>In his free time, he and his wife like to hike locally and travel, although those plans have been put on hold now due to COVID. They have been to France, England, Austria, Germany, Morocco and of course, his favorite destination—Italy. While he waits for the world to re-open, D’Andrea has set his sights on the Princeton Art Museum, where he will apply to be a docent. “After all this time, I still look for new and exciting things to do,&#8221; he said.</p>

Overall home sales in Putnam County in the fourth quarter skyrock]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Realtors in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area that includes the lower Hudson Valley region, adapted to state-imposed restrictions early in the pandemic and rode the wave of pent-up buyer demand to post sales increases as compared to 2019 activity.</p>
<p>Sales in Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Putnam counties soared in the fourth quarter with all markets posting double-digit increases in closed transactions, according to a<a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2021/01/OneKey-MLS-4th-Qtr-2020-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report</a> released earlier this month by OneKey MLS. Overall home sales in Putnam County in the fourth quarter skyrocketed 61.8%, while Rockland sales soared 51.3%, followed by Sullivan County with a 45.6% rise. Westchester County saw a 41% increase in overall home sales in the fourth quarter, followed closely by Orange County at 40%. Bronx County in the fourth quarter posted a 3% decline in overall home sales.</p>
<p>The single-family home market fueled much of the surge, as Westchester posted a 57.7% increase in sales in the fourth quarter 2020 as compared to a year earlier. Putnam’s single-family market shot up 64%, Sullivan County saw a 45.7% rise in sales, Rockland County posted a 57.3% spike, while Orange County’s single-family home sales activity was 49% higher than 12 months earlier and the Bronx posted a 12.3% increase in single-family sales the last three months of 2020.</p>
<p>For the year, Westchester’s single-family home sales were 14% higher and overall sales increased by 2.5%. Putnam County’s single-family sales rose 20.1% and overall sales spiked 20.3% in 2020. Single-family sales in Rockland increased 14.7% for the year ad overall sales were 10.4% higher. Orange County’s single-family market posted an 8.5% increase for the year, while overall sales were 4.4% higher than in 2019. Sullivan County’s single-family sector posted a 25.8%. increase and overall sales rose 24.4% during that 12-month period.</p>
<p>Bronx County’s single-family market, impacted by COVID-19 and the exodus of city residents to the suburbs, declined by 10.4% for the year, while overall sales in the Bronx fell sharply at 18.9%.</p>
<p>The combination of strong sales and limited inventory caused the median price of single-family homes to rise throughout the region for the year: Westchester up 12.2% to $735,000; Putnam County up 6.0% to $380,000; Rockland County up 9.9% to $500,000; Orange County up 16.0% to $315,000 and Sullivan County ups 36.8% to $195,000. Despite lower sales, the single-family home price in the Bronx for 2020 rose 6.0% to $530,000.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: To review the full OneKey MLS report and statistics for Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx counties, please see pages 19 and 20.</p>
<p>Crystal Hawkins Syska, 2021 president of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, said that while overall and single-family home sales activity were strong in 2021, the cooperative sector in Westchester County in 2020 suffered a 16.7% decline in sales activity, while the Bronx’s co-op market saw a 17.2% decrease in sales for the year.</p>
<p>“I actually perceive we are going to have a further slide in co-ops because of the fact that there is still this movement out of New York City,” Skysa, who is an Associate Broker with Keller Williams NY Realty in White Plains, said. “People who are seeking homes in the lower-priced points are skipping right past to some of the other counties.”</p>
<p>She said that many are working remotely at their homes and therefore are saying to themselves: “If I can spend $300,000 why even deal with a co-op when I can go further (north) and buy a house.” She blames not only COVID and its impact on the workforce, but also on a cumbersome co-op approval process, which Hawkins Syska said needs to be reformed.</p>
<p>The migration north has also impacted the luxury market in Westchester, particularly the Northern Westchester market and surrounding suburban locations, according to Elizabeth Nunan, president and CEO, Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>She said the fourth quarter sales activity reflected an unprecedented level of activity in the Fall 2020 Market. Every price point was active, including the luxury market that lagged in some locations during previous years. Year over year, Westchester County inventory was down 27% while pending sales were up 46% at the end of 2020.</p>
<p>“In Lower Westchester, sales remain strong as buyers anticipate returning to commuting to New York City and the ease offered by these communities,” said Nunan. “However, it is noted that many buyers anticipate continuing the ‘work from home’ model and have ventured further north. Northern Westchester stands out as home sales soared 40% and inventory declined 40%.”</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer for Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, stated in the brokerage firm’s review of the New York markets that the pandemic’s divergent economic impact is skewing sales to the high end, because entry-level buyers at lower price points are more affected by the economic slowdown than higher-income buyers. He noted in the report the people who normally buy entry-level single-family homes or lower-prices condos and co-ops are more likely to have lost their jobs or seen their hours cut, especially if they’re in industries like hospitality or leisure.</p>
<p>“We can see proof of this impact throughout the region, in that lower-priced property types like condos, co-ops, and rentals are not seeing the same surge in activity that we’re seeing in the higher-priced single-family home market,” Rand stated.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we believe that demand will be strong throughout 2021. We know that the pipeline of new contracts going into 2021 is much higher than a year ago, that inventory is low, that interest rates keep falling through historic lows, and that economic conditions should improve with the continued distribution of the COVID vaccine,” he predicted.</p>
<p>Brokerage network Westchester Real Estate, in its fourth quarter report, noted the sales surge in the fourth quarter. “The fourth quarter is normally on the quieter side for real estate but not this year. Sales soared as we saw a continuation of what started in the spring – an exodus from denser urban areas to suburban and even more rural outposts; a search for homes with more indoor as well as outdoor space; and a determination by potential new homeowners to buy while mortgage interest rates are still below 3%.”</p>
<p>The report, authored by Westchester Real Estate Executive Director Gail Fattizzi, added, “With inventory already drained from earlier months, and no decrease in buyer interest, the biggest challenge was ﬁnding homes to buy, then outbidding the competition. Not every home saw multiple offers, but desirable new listings saw robust activity and over-ask contract prices, even in areas that buyers previously had not considered.”</p>
<p>Westchester Real Estate concluded that the only clear limitation to the expected strong 2021 spring market is the low inventory of available homes for sale.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>To begin 2021, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> chose to interview HGAR President Crystal Hawkins Syska who begins her term under unprecedented circumstances with the nation in the grip of a deadly pandemic, a national economic crisis and social and political unrest that will likely shape policy and economic activity for years to come.</p>
<p>In recognition of the continued spread of COVID-19, Hawkins Syska will be the first association president to be installed virtually. On Feb. 4 from 5 p.m. to 6:45 p.m., HGAR will install its 2021 President, Executive Officers and Directors via Zoom.</p>
<p>Hawkins Syska and HGAR Officers will be installed by National Association of Realtors President Charlie Oppler. NYSAR President David Legaz will install the 2021 HGAR Directors. The Installation Gala program will also include a 30-minute mixer with breakout sessions prior to the program and entertainment by international music duo, “The Reminders.” A Swag Bag with champagne and gourmet snack will also be available for those who purchase tickets prior to Jan. 21. For more information go to: <a href="https://www.hgar.com/event/hgar-installation-of-2021-20210204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hgar.com/event/hgar-installation-of-2021-20210204</a>.</p>
<p>Hawkins Syska, an Associate Broker with Keller Williams NY Realty in White Plains, has been in the real estate business since earning her license in 2004.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/87160786_4017093588304432_1952721715943440384_o.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-35141" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/87160786_4017093588304432_1952721715943440384_o.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="325" /></a>The Bronx native first joined the HGAR Board of Directors in 2017 and served as Secretary before being named President-elect in 2020. She also serves as a Director with the New York State Association of Realtors. The graduate of City College of New York began her real estate career with a small brokerage firm in Ossining before joining Keller Williams NY Realty. Hawkins Syska specializes in short sales and has a Certified Distressed Properties Expert (CDPE) certification and has a service area from the Bronx to Dutchess County.</p>
<p>Before entering real estate, Hawkins Syska worked as a property manager in Greenwich, CT for about two years. Her first post-college position was in public relations and communications with the International Rescue Committee in Manhattan, which helps refugees from foreign countries, settle into the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> As we enter 2021, the Hudson Valley region is experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths. While the real estate industry remains fully operational, with safety protocols, what would you say to Realtors working in these most difficult times?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/61858049_2401853363394196_7309626255769337856_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-35143" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/61858049_2401853363394196_7309626255769337856_n.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="375" /></a>Hawkins Syska:</strong> I would say they need to work smart and to be cautious and considerate. We should not take any unnecessary risks as we try to help individuals continue in their goal to homeownership. In my mind what that means is I think that with the protocols that we have in place we should make sure that we are only taking the most qualified buyers into properties—meaning asking for the COVID disclosures, which are required, but also asking for pre-approvals for funds, which is very important. This is not the time for “tire kickers.” Ultimately it elevates our service anyhow, because we are really dealing with the people who want to buy now.</p>
<p>I also think that we should take precautions in terms of protecting our homeowners and work with them and their concerns—making sure that there is hand sanitizer, booties and masks are available in order to go the extra mile in protecting the public.</p>
<p>Also, we should protect ourselves. It is not required that they have to work (in-person), but when they do so they make sure that they are not taking any unnecessary exposure to themselves. I personally had COVID-19. It was brought into our home through one of our kids and the truth is that what we experience with the illness is not necessarily what plays out in real life with what we hear on the news. Our teenager had the symptoms far worse than either myself or Peter (Spino, her fiancée) did. And that was not what we thought (when first contracting the virus).</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> A native of the Fordham section of the Bronx, you are taking on the role of HGAR President shortly after the association merged with the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors. Do you believe the formal addition of the Bronx to HGAR’s market area is important and if so, why?</p>
<p><strong>Hawkins Syska:</strong> I do feel the merger is important and I am really excited that they joined exactly at the time that I will be president. There is a synergistic relationship between the Bronx and Westchester County. You can go to nearly any part of Westchester County and you will find former Bronxites. They are even in areas where a lot of us settle. When I look at this there is definitely those who leave the city to come up (to the northern suburbs) and there are those who are actually leaving Westchester to go back to the Bronx to have that type of lifestyle. So, I think that it is incredible that we are all one, together.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Fair Housing has been in the news, especially with NAR recently offering an apology for past practices in terms of its past actions on fair housing. HGAR has embarked on a number of fair housing initiatives. Can you provide an update and if you have any further plans to institute new fair housing programs at HGAR?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/76964899_2510635975691277_17928756861599744_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-35142" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/76964899_2510635975691277_17928756861599744_n.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /></a>Hawkins Syska:</strong> My specific theme for this year, my platform is “Fulfilling the American Promise” and that is a direct response to what we have seen as challenges in everyone receiving fair and equal treatment when it comes to housing. This year we will be creating a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee and it’s my intention that committee will be working with Fair Housing and Education (committees) to bring fresh new insight and training to our members to make sure we can serve the public at the highest level.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Hawkins Syska said that committee chairs and members have yet to be named.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Can you outline your administration’s other plans and goals for 2021 at HGAR?</p>
<p><strong>Hawkins Syska:</strong> I want to increase our visibility to the public through some public service announcements on local cable channels… I am looking to work with our local governments to create access to Department of Buildings’ information for the whole county, to be more similar to New York City.</p>
<p>The other goal is to increase the diversity among our agents and work more homogenously with other communities. One way (to increase diversity among agents) is more conversations need to happen on the high school level about what it means to be a real estate agent because of the fact that my step daughter just graduated high school and is now in college and there are quite a few of her friends that are actually looking to join the real estate industry. So, I think if we could actually create programs geared more to the young about the impact of real estate on wealth in all the neighborhoods, I think that we would raise awareness and attract different groups of people to the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> HGAR has been heavily involved in legislative advocacy throughout the Hudson Valley and now is engaged in representing members in the New York City region in both Albany and Washington, DC. Are there any critical legislative issues you would like to see either advanced or defeated during your term of office?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/125030612_10225643527022043_4082514212898584594_o-e1611177253767.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-35140" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/125030612_10225643527022043_4082514212898584594_o-e1611177253767.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="293" /></a>Hawkins Syska:</strong> I would definitely want to see on the local and state level more of a recognition of affordable housing because affordable housing is not just for those starting out, but also for our seniors, which are about to be a really big group, bigger than any other and there is not enough housing for them to stay in Westchester. So, I think we need to revisit rent control laws because there are a lot of aspects of them that are unintended consequences that are actually harming the public as opposed to helping them. Also, we need to address co-op transparency.</p>
<p>Based on a lot of things that have happened this year and when it comes to co-op sales that are down 16.7%, people just slip past them (co-ops) and are willing to move to places like Sullivan County and part of that is the process. So, I think co-op disclosure is very important.</p>
<p>I also think that the initiatives President Barack Obama put in place for HUD need to come back on the federal level, such as the language changes in the Fair Housing Act&#8217;s Disparate Impact Standard.</p>
<p>Another key issue is the SALT Cap. We lost a lot of sales to Connecticut because of that cap and we need to have that changed. I am really excited that it looks positive in that direction (that the new Biden administration may change or repeal the SALT Cap imposed as part of the federal Tax Cuts and Job Act passed in 2017.)</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS – In 2021, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors celebrates the 25th anniversary of the launch of its flagship monthly newspaper <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> and is also acknowledging the 95th consecutive year of publishing a membership newspaper/magazine.</p>
<p>In early 1995, based on the work of several Westchester County Board of Realtors’ committees, most notably the Communications and Long Range Planning Committees, then WCBR Executive Vice President (now retired) P. Gilbert Mercurio and the organization’s Board of Directors decided the Board needed to upgrade the editorial coverage of its then monthly newspaper <em>Westchester Realtor</em>. Along with newly hired Editor John Jordan and the newspaper’s longtime Graphic Design Consultant Bart D’Andrea of Meadow Art &amp; Design, work began on formulating an editorial mission statement as well as renaming and redesigning the publication.</p>
<p>For just about a year, the publisher and newspaper staff discussed what news should be in the newspaper each month and how it should be presented. It was decided that due to the changing needs of its membership, the Board’s newspaper needed to expand from just covering Board-related news and announcements to a regional real estate publication that covered the major local, regional and national real estate and finance news of the day, as well as report on the activities of the association and its affiliated multiple listing service. The association also hired professional business photographer John Vecchiolla who has for the past quarter century provided professional and quality photography of news events and Board activities that has greatly enhanced the graphics of the newspaper.</p>
<p>After nearly 12 months of planning, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> was launched in January 1996. Its first edition chronicled the news of the day which included a report on fourth quarter home sales activity in Westchester County, an exclusive report on the appointment of then WCBR member Edwardina Lodes to the newly formed State Board of Real Estate and Governor Pataki pressing for the outright repeal of the much criticized “Cuomo Tax.” Every year, Real Estate In-Depth provides extensive coverage of the Annual Lobby Day event to keep members informed on key legislative proposals and initiatives in Albany that will benefit or hurt the industry. The newspaper also reports on the association’s legislative efforts in Washington, DC as well.</p>
<p>Since its launch, the newspaper has reported on the major real estate news and trends of the day, even scooped the dailies and the real estate trades press on occasion, while still serving as WCBR’s and later the Westchester Putnam Association of Realtors and now the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ flagship communications vehicle. The newspaper has grown from printing approximately 4,000 copies each month in 1996 to a press run in 2021 of more than 12,000 each edition. Thanks to a substantial increase in advertising support, the average size of an edition has grown from 20 pages in 1996 to 28 pages or more today.</p>
<p>WCBR’s Mercurio, in a Publisher’s Note in the first edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> explained the reasons behind the cessation of publication of Westchester Realtor in favor of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. A quarter of a century later, his words still apply.</p>
<p>“WCBR felt that since the real estate industry is in the midst of a drastic change the Board’s monthly publication had to adapt to these tumultuous times… Our flagship communication vehicle has to mirror what is going on in the industry and inform membership of the latest news not only in Westchester, but the region, since many of our members do business outside the county,” Mercurio wrote in the January-February 1996 edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>.</p>
<p>“The sky is the limit with what we can do with this publication in the future,” Mercurio added. “WCBR asks its members and readership to patronize our advertisers who are supporting our effort to bring you the only real estate-oriented publication in the lower New York State region.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/newdesign-copy-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-35158" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/newdesign-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="464" /></a></p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> Editor Jordan, who served as editor of Westchester Realtor in its last year of publication, said in a story published for the newspaper’s 10-year anniversary, “<em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has grown from humble beginnings to a publication that is a must read for the WCBR membership and for other area real estate and finance industry officials alike. The tremendous surge in advertising support over the years is due in large part to the fact that the paper is so widely read by Realtors and other real estate and finance professionals. I would just like to thank and acknowledge the foresight of WCBR to realize that a newspaper of this type was possible and could be successful.</p>
<p>“For all who have lent a hand, written a column, sold an ad, purchased an ad, taken a picture, drawn a cartoon, worked on the paper’s design, written a letter to the editor or just offered a word of encouragement, my heartfelt thanks,” Jordan added.</p>
<p>Today, Jordan relates that his sentiments expressed 15 years ago still ring true. “I have been lucky and honored to work with a group of professionals (both staff and volunteer Directors and Officers) that believe in the mission of this publication and work hard to make sure each edition brings value and useful information to the membership and readership. We have flourished during the boom years and persevered during the recessions that dogged the real estate market here and across the country. In the past year, we have chronicled the devastating health and economic impacts the coronavirus pandemic has had on the nation and the region and the real estate industry’s admirable response that has fueled much needed economic activity in such trying times.”</p>
<p>He noted that the publication’s success has been due in large part to HGAR’s leadership, including the aforementioned Mercurio and current HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty, as well as the association’s leadership and Board of Directors over the past quarter century that has believed in and supported the newspaper’s mission.</p>
<p>For 25 years, the newspaper staff and contributors have strived to present an accurate and at times “In-Depth” view of the major news and trends affecting real estate here and across the nation in the publication’s print edition and at the newspaper’s interactive newspaper website at <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.realestateindepth.com</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales rose in December, with home sales in 2020 reaching their highest level since 2006, the National Association of Realtors announced today. Activity in the major regions was mixed on a month-over-month basis, but each of the four areas recorded double-digit year-over-year growth in December.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, increased 0.7% from November to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million in December. Sales in total rose year-over-year, up 22.2% from a year ago (5.53 million in December 2019).</p>
<p>&#8220;Home sales rose in December, and for 2020 as a whole, we saw sales perform at their highest levels since 2006, despite the pandemic,&#8221; said Lawrence Yun, NAR&#8217;s chief economist. &#8220;What&#8217;s even better is that this momentum is likely to carry into the new year, with more buyers expected to enter the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yun predicts a continuation of the strong activity that&#8217;s currently taking place in the housing market and in the overall economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although mortgage rates are projected to increase, they will continue to hover near record lows at around 3%,&#8221; Yun said. &#8220;Moreover, expect economic conditions to improve with additional stimulus forthcoming and vaccine distribution already underway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $309,800, up 12.9% from December 2019 ($274,500), as prices increased in every region. December&#8217;s national price increase marked 106 straight months of year-over-year gains.</p>
<p>Total housing inventory at the end of December totaled 1.07 million units, down 16.4% from November and down 23% from one year ago (1.39 million). Unsold inventory sits at an all-time low 1.9-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 2.3 months in November and down from the 3.0-month figure recorded in December 2019. NAR first began tracking the single-family home supply in 1982.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 21 days in December, seasonally even with November and down from 41 days in December 2019. Seventy percent of the homes sold in December 2020 were on the market for less than a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;To their credit, homebuilders and construction companies have increased efforts to build, with housing starts hitting an annual rate of near 1.7 million in December, with more focus on single-family homes,&#8221; Yun said. &#8220;However, it will take vigorous new home construction in 2021 and in 2022 to adequately furnish the market to properly meet the demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 31% of sales in December, unchanged from the same time in 2019, but down from 32% in November 2020. NAR&#8217;s 2020 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, released in late 2020, revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 31%.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, purchased 14% of homes in December, identical to the share recorded in November 2020 and a small decline from 17% in December 2019. All-cash sales accounted for 19% of transactions in December, down from 20% in both November and December 2019.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in December, equal to November&#8217;s percentage but down from 2% in December 2019.</p>
<p>“NAR will work with the incoming Biden administration in pursuit of policies promoting housing affordability and accessibility,” said NAR President Charlie Oppler, a Realtor from Franklin Lakes, NJ, and the CEO of Prominent Properties Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty. &#8220;We were pleased with the homebuyer tax credit President Biden proposed as a candidate and we look forward to continuing our work with Congress and the White House. We will aim to find common ground, especially related to ways of boosting home supply, and work toward solutions that will protect and support homeownership and America&#8217;s broader real estate industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 2.68% in December, down from 2.77% in November. The average commitment rate across all of 2020 was 3.11%.</p>
<p>Single-family home sales rose at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.03 million in December, up 0.7% from 5.99 million in November, and up 22.8% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $314,300 in December, up 13.5% from December 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Single-family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 730,000 units in December, up 1.4% from November and up 17.7% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $272,200 in December, an increase of 6.9% from a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Median home prices increased at double-digit rates in each of the four major regions from one year ago.</p>
<p>December 2020 saw existing-home sales in the Northeast climbed 4.5%, recording an annual rate of 930,000, a 27.4% increase from a year ago. The median price in the Northeast was $362,100, up 19.0% from December 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Midwest were unchanged, recording an annual rate of 1,590,000 in December, but up 26.2% from a year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $235,700, a 13.7% increase from December 2019.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South increased 1.1% to an annual rate of 2,860,000 in December, up 20.7% from the same time one year ago. The median price in the South was $268,100, an 11.3% increase from a year ago.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West fell 1.4% from the month prior, recording an annual rate of 1,380,000 in December, a 17.9% increase from a year ago. The median price in the West was $467,900, up 14.2% from December 2019.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The report released on Jan. 21 by property database curator ATTOM Data Solutions found that 18 of the 50 U.S. counties most at-risk in the fourth quarter of 2020 were in metropolitan statistical areas around New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>IRVINE, CA—A recently released study has found that pockets of the Northeast, including three counties in the Hudson Valley region, were most at risk to the impacts of the coronavirus heading into 2021.</p>
<p>The report released on Jan. 21 by property database curator ATTOM Data Solutions found that 18 of the 50 U.S. counties most at-risk in the fourth quarter of 2020 were in metropolitan statistical areas around New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.</p>
<p>They included eight counties in or near the New York City suburbs including Dutchess, Orange and Rockland counties in New York; Bergen, Essex, Ocean, Passaic and Sussex counties in New Jersey, along with four counties around Philadelphia, PA (Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties in New Jersey plus Delaware County, PA).</p>
<p>The other six were in the Chicago suburbs (DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties). The New York and Chicago metropolitan areas saw increases from the third quarter of 2020 in the numbers of counties on the top 50 list.</p>
<p>While seven of Connecticut’s eight counties made the top 50 list in the third quarter of 2020, just two did in the fourth quarter—Litchfield and Windham counties. The number of counties on the list in the Baltimore metro area also fell notably in the fourth quarter, from four to one (Carroll County) and dropped from four to two in the Washington, D.C, area (Charles County, MD, and Prince George’s County, MD).</p>
<p>Nationwide, the study revealed that New Jersey, Illinois, California, Louisiana, New York, Florida and Maryland had 40 of the 50 counties most vulnerable to the economic impact of the pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter trends generally continued those found in the third quarter of 2020, but with different concentrations around several major metropolitan areas. The number of counties among the top 50 most at-risk was up from five to eight in the New York City area and from three to six in the Chicago area, but down from four to two in the Washington, D.C., region and from four to one in the Baltimore, MD area.</p>
<p>Markets are considered more or less at risk based on the percentage of homes facing possible foreclosure, the portion with mortgage balances that exceed the estimated property value and the percentage of average local wages required to pay for major home ownership expenses.</p>
<p>“Areas of the U.S. most at risk from damage connected to the Coronavirus pandemic spread out somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2020. But they still fell mainly along the East Coast, with significant pockets in certain areas, while other parts of the country seem to be less vulnerable,” said Todd Teta, chief product officer with ATTOM Data Solutions.</p>
<p>He continued, “This report is not a sign that any area actually took a fall in the fourth quarter. It’s more a gauge of areas that may be more vulnerable if the market falters. In the coming months, much will depend on whether the country can halt the pandemic. We will continue to keep a close watch on home sales and prices to see how everything shakes out in 2021 and if changes hit different regions in different ways.”</p>
<p>Major home ownership costs (mortgage payments, property taxes and insurance) consumed more than 30% of average local wages in 36 of the 50 counties that were most vulnerable to market problems connected to the virus pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2020. The highest percentages in those counties were in Rockland County (65% of average wages needed for major ownership costs); El Dorado County, CA, (outside Sacramento) (57.8%); Bergen County, NJ (outside New York City) (55.3%); Delaware County, PA (outside Philadelphia) (52%) and Beaufort County (Hilton Head), SC (51.7%). Nationwide, major expenses on the median-priced home typically consumed 29.6% of average wages.</p>
<p>At least 15% of mortgages were underwater in the third quarter of 2020 (the latest data available on owners owing more than their properties are worth) in 33 of the 50 most at-risk counties. Nationwide, 12.3% of mortgages fell into that category. Those with the highest underwater rates in those counties were Lowndes County (Valdosta), GA (36.8% of mortgages underwater); Hardin County, KY (outside Louisville) (32.8%); Cumberland County (Vineland), NJ (30.8%); Caddo Parish (Shreveport), LA (28.6%) and Atlantic County (Atlantic City), NJ (27.8%), the report stated.</p>
<p>More than one in 2,500 residential properties faced a foreclosure action in the third quarter of 2020 in 29 of the 50 most at-risk counties. Nationwide, one in 5,048 homes were in that position. (Foreclosure actions dropped about 80% last year amid a federal moratorium on banks taking back properties from homeowners behind on their mortgages during the virus pandemic.) Those with the highest rates in those counties were Hardin County, KY (outside Louisville) (one in 1,032 residential properties facing possible foreclosure); Onslow County (Jacksonville), NC (one in 1,090); Caddo Parish (Shreveport), LA (one in 1,361); Saint Clair County, IL (outside St. Louis, MO) (one in 1,409) and Livingston Parish, LA (outside Baton Rouge) (one in 1,562).</p>
<p>Eighteen of the 50 counties least vulnerable to pandemic-related problems from among the 499 included in the fourth-quarter report were in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. They were concentrated in the Denver, Boston, Minneapolis, Houston and Dallas metro areas. The largest of the 50 least at-risk counties were Harris County (Houston), TX; King County (Seattle), WA; Clark County (Las Vegas), NV; Tarrant County (Fort Worth), TX and Middlesex County, MA (outside Boston).</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Top New York real estate leaders weighed in on the region’s residential market, from the latest prices in Manhattan to bidding wars in Westchester, and shared strategies for how Realtors can take advantage of the current dynamics, at a virtual panel Jan. 22 hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Residential brokerage experts in the New York metro region believe the home sales boom in the New York City suburbs will continue in 2021 while the recovery of New York City’s market will depend heavily on the success of the COVID vaccine and its impact on if and when residents and businesses will return to Manhattan.</p>
<p>Top New York real estate leaders weighed in on the region’s residential market, from the latest prices in Manhattan to bidding wars in Westchester, and shared strategies for how Realtors can take advantage of the current dynamics, at a virtual panel held on Jan. 22 hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. and OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>Approximately 350 industry professionals tuned in for “Getting the Deal Done: The State of NY Real Estate: Setting Sights on 2021 + Beyond.” The panel featured Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens; Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel Inc. and Joe Rand, chief creative officer of Howard Hanna/Rand Realty and executive director, Broker Public Portal. The discussion was moderated by Brian D. Tormey, NTP, president of TitleVest, a leading New York City-based provider of title insurance and related real estate services.</p>
<p>“We’ve all had to pivot during the pandemic and we’ve seen tremendous innovation in our industry,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of HGAR and President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer of OneKey MLS, the regional multiple listing service for New York, in describing how the industry reacted to the state-imposed shutdown of the real estate market beginning in March 2020.</p>
<p>In reviewing the market’s response to the pandemic, Haggerty said, “I have been in the business for 35 years, what we saw this year (2020) was staggering.” He related that after an active first quarter, the market was all but closed in March and for several months thereafter, but pent up demand fueled a robust market recovery in the third quarter and most notably the fourth quarter in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>He related that single-family home sales, despite the pandemic, were 14% higher in 2020 in Westchester County as compared to 2019. Rockland single-family home sales ended the year 14.7% higher, Orange County posted an 8.5% increase; Putnam’s single-family home sales spiked 20% and Sullivan County sales shot up 25.8% in the same period. Bronx County was the only market north of New York City to post lower single-family home sales, down 10% for the year as compared to 2019.</p>
<p>“Look for a V-shaped recovery,” said Miller. “And by that, I mean ‘vaccine.’ True stability doesn’t really happen until people feel safe.”</p>
<p>While most of the news out of New York City has been negative, Miller added he has seen an upside as more affordability is creating a “youth renaissance” in Manhattan’s rental space.</p>
<p>Miller said COVID-19 “crushed” the rental market in Manhattan, noting pricing was down some 23% overall in 2020, with some sections of the borough suffering pricing declines approaching 40%.</p>
<p>While Miller expects pricing to be soft going forward in 2021, the rental housing market was very active in December. He revealed that new apartment lease signings in December 2020 in Manhattan were at their highest level in 14 years.</p>
<p>Brown Harris Stevens’ Freedman agreed, noting that of late her firm has seen pre-pandemic like contract activity in Manhattan’s residential market. “It’s looking good thus far (in 2021),” she added.</p>
<p>Freedman also said the vaccine’s impact on the market will be critical to New York City’s recovery. “Having the vaccine in sight is excellent. It diminishes the uncertainty. The path forward is going to be a bit tough but at least we have some resolution.” She said it is vitally important to the future recovery of the New York City market that the federal, state and city governments get control of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Freedman said she’s optimistic for 2021. “New York City is going to do very well,” she said. “It’s still a buyer’s market—an opportunity market—rates are low. But theaters are going to reopen, restaurants are going to reopen &#8230; I’m doubling down on my prediction for New York City in 2021.”</p>
<p>Rand characterized the view of some that have predicted the death of urban centers due to COVID-19 as “crazy” and in fact said that many of the people who migrated out of Manhattan to the suburbs or elsewhere were people who were going to leave the city in the next couple of years anyway and were just pushed to make the decision early due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>“So, I think what is going to happen is that we are going to see it (migration out of Manhattan) slow and then in a year-and-a-half from now we are going to be saying, ‘There is no one moving from the city to the suburbs. They all moved back in 2020.’”</p>
<p>Rand also discussed trends in pricing north of New York City and the types of properties being sold.</p>
<p>“COVID is impacting pricing, in the short term, in two ways,” he said. “First, all that migration from New York City to the suburbs, those are higher-end buyers. So, the mix of properties being sold is skewing higher, they’re competing and pushing prices up. Also, the economic impact of COVID is disproportionately hitting lower-income people. And that’s really unfortunate &#8230; we should be doing more from a public policy standpoint to help people.”</p>
<p>“Getting the Deal Done” is part of the “Be Your Best” webinar series created by HGAR and OneKey MLS, to assist Realtors and agents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was sponsored by TitleVest.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his State of the State address reported that he intends to issue a Request for Information for interested parties in securing up to three of the remaining casino gaming licenses in Downstate New York (New York City metro region) to be granted by New York State.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>While details are still sketchy at press time, the massive state deficit that has been estimated between $8 billion and $15 billion may be the cause for the state to begin the process of awarding up to three casino gaming licenses in Downstate New York earlier than originally planned.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his State of the State address reported that he intends to issue a Request for Information for interested parties in securing up to three of the remaining casino gaming licenses in Downstate New York (New York City metro region) to be granted by New York State.</p>
<p>While further details were not released, the New York State Gaming Commission noted that the proposal, if part of the state budget, would have to be approved by the State Legislature by the end of the fiscal year (March 31, 2021). While the Gaming Commission offered no further information or a timeline on when those licenses might be approved, it did release a study on Monday Jan. 27 undertaken by Spectrum Gaming Group, on the impact of downstate casino gaming and mobile sports betting on the state’s economy and the potential windfall in revenues the new facilities could bring to state government. The governor has also proposed the legalization of mobile sports betting as a revenue source to help offset the impact of the coronavirus in the 2022 state budget, as well as the legalization of recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>The addition of up to three casino gaming facilities in the New York City metro region that might include: Empire City Casino in Yonkers, Resorts World New York at Aqueduct Raceway in Queens—both operating as Video Lottery Terminal (VLT) facilities—and perhaps at the new Belmont complex in Nassau County or at a site to be developed in Manhattan, would definitely impact customer traffic at Resorts World Catskills in Sullivan County and at other existing upstate casinos. If the downstate initiative does move forward, the state would be beginning the process early, since the state’s gaming law bans the award of downstate casino licenses until 2023. The measure was intended to allow the upstate casinos to establish a client base before they faced competition from downstate facilities.</p>
<p>If downstate casinos move forward ahead of plan, the economic impact on the New York City and surrounding markets would be significant. For Westchester County, if MGM Resorts’ Empire City Casino is granted one of the available full gaming licenses, the City of Yonkers and Westchester County would definitely benefit from the expansion at the storied complex along the New York State Thruway that would include new construction and permanent jobs and significant investment in the expansion that could include new hotel and conference center space.</p>
<p>Gaming interests have been lobbying state lawmakers for some time to move the clock forward on downstate gaming. The Business Council of Westchester has been advocating for a full casino license to be issued to Empire City Casino. John Ravitz, executive vice president and chief operating officer of The Business Council of Westchester, said the full casino license at Empire City, along with approval for Empire City to manage mobile sports betting, will be among the top items on the Rye Brook, NY-based organization’s legislative agenda for this session of the State Legislature.</p>
<p>An Empire City Casino spokesman in a prepared statement in connection with the potential downstate casino RFI release, stated, “Empire City Casino was the largest private employer in Yonkers before the pandemic, and like many businesses, we’ve been hit hard during COVID-19. A full-scale casino license, with mobile sports betting and live dealers, would significantly speed up recovery, help us hire back employees and put more local residents back to work. It would also generate significant and immediate new revenue for the state through license fees and put revenue back into the local economies, especially Yonkers, Bronx, and Mount Vernon, where most of our employees live.”</p>
<p>The impact of new downstate licensed gaming awards on existing upstate gaming facilities could prove troublesome to operations already under stress due to COVID-19.</p>
<div id="attachment_35254" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Resorts-World-Catskills.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35254" class="wp-image-35254" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Resorts-World-Catskills.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="228" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-35254" class="wp-caption-text">Resorts World Catskills casino in Monticello opened its doors for the first time to customers on Feb. 8, 2018.</p></div>
<p>A spokesman for Resorts World Catskills said in connection with the governor’s announcement and Gaming Commission study of downstate casinos, “Since reopening in September, we have begun implementing the marketing and growth strategies to fulfill the untapped potential of Resorts World Catskills. On a parallel track, we will continue to work with our local and state partners on a variety of issues including protecting the good-paying union jobs that are critical during this period of severe unemployment.”</p>
<p>Resorts World Catskills in June 2019 agreed to build a VLT facility (similar to existing facilities at Empire City Casino in Yonkers and at Resorts World New York in Queens) in Orange County to lure more downstate customers to their operations.</p>
<p>In June 2019, New York State Senator James Skoufis announced that his legislation to establish a VLT facility in Orange County had received a three-way agreement between the Senate, Assembly and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The VLT license, owned by Resorts World, will be transferred from its closed Monticello operation to the new site in Orange County if developed.</p>
<p>In reaction to the latest gaming news, Resorts World Catskills says it is continuing to work on the planning for the Orange County project.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Resorts World Catskills stated, “Since 2019, after New York State approved a plan for a video gaming machine facility in Orange County, we have conducted a series of site analyses in the area and that due diligence is ongoing. We look forward to continuing to work with the community as we formulate a plan to bring good-paying jobs to the region and to generate additional revenue for New York’s public schools.”</p>
<p>Among some of the highlights of the Spectrum Gaming Group’s report on downstate gaming and mobile sports betting include:</p>
<p>• Downstate counties show the greatest potential for growth in Gross Gaming Revenue, ranging from $970 million to $4.49 billion for New York City, and $606 million to $1.13 billion for Long Island. The potential of the New York City market could be captured by the addition of new gaming facilities. The potential of the Metro-North region may be realized by the addition of an already-approved Orange County video lottery gaming facility, as well as through expansion of gaming further Downstate. Spectrum indicates that such expansion might have negative impacts on existing gaming facilities.</p>
<p>• In light of the economic fallout from COVID-19, the State of New York could opt to delay, for an undetermined period, the decision to authorize the three commercial casinos in the Downstate region, the report stated.</p>
<p>• Spectrum recommended that a competitive bid process be utilized to arrive at the most optimal result for the state based upon a review of the economic, fiscal, and social implications of the awarding of up to three additional commercial casino licenses.</p>
<p>• Job growth in the gaming sector from 2015-2020 has been significant, as total employment at casinos and video-lottery gaming facilities grew from 12,000 jobs in 2015 to 15,700 jobs in 2020, of which roughly 3,400 are at the four commercial casinos that make up the Upstate expansion properties. Spectrum estimated that there are 32,000 people employed in the entire sector. While upstate expansion accounted for 17% of total employment, it accounted for 75% of growth from 2015-2000.</p>
<p>• Spectrum’s analysis concludes the state’s gaming industry will slowly recover from the pandemic, returning to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2023.</p>
<p>• With respect to mobile sports betting, Spectrum indicated that stabilization of revenue will occur three to five years after commencement. The firm’s analysis concluded that at a 10% tax rate, retail and mobile sports wagering would generate between $72 million to $104 million in tax revenue to the state. The proposal advanced by the FY 2022 Executive Budget uses the same gross revenue estimate to generate upwards of $500 million for education. The estimate assumes that the tribal sports wagering operators will not be able to generate meaningful market share.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release of the gaming report, New York State Gaming Commission Spokesman Brad Maione stated, “This report provides a valuable tool for the commission and policy makers to use as discussions continue on the future of the gaming industry in New York. This report should assist with making sound fiscal decisions.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The SALT Cap was highly criticized by New York politicians, as well as the New York State real estate industry, including the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—U.S. Reps. Mondaire Jones (D-NY), Tom Suozzi (D-NY) and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer on Thursday introduced the SALT Deductibility Act that would remove the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions imposed in 2017 under the federal tax reform law.</p>
<p>The SALT Cap was highly criticized by New York politicians, as well as the New York State real estate industry, including the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>“When it comes to SALT, if you think Westchester and Rockland families needed and deserved this money before the coronavirus took hold, the stakes are even higher now because the cap is costing this community tens-of-thousands of dollars they could be using amid the crisis… Double taxing hardworking homeowners is plainly unfair.  We need to bring our federal dollars back home to cushion the blow of this virus—and this harmful SALT cap—has dealt to so many homeowners and families locally,” said U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer.</p>
<p>The SALT Deductibility Act would remove the cap on the SALT deduction instituted in 2017 as part of then President Donald Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and would allow New Yorkers to fully deduct their state and local taxes from their federal taxes.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump cut taxes for billionaires and big corporations and paid for it on the backs of hardworking families in Westchester and Rockland counties, where we pay the highest property taxes in the entire nation,” said Rep. Jones at a press conference announcing the introduction of the SALT bill. “That must change. Restoring the SALT deduction is a necessary first step to creating an equitable tax system—one where we put money back in the pockets of working people.”</p>
<p>Congressman Jones’ said the passage of the bill will bring needed relief to his constituents in Westchester and Rockland who pay the highest property taxes of any Congressional District in the entire nation, with Westchester ranked first and Rockland ranked second.</p>
<p>Others who praised the bill’s introduction were U.S, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who said, “The reinstating of the SALT Deduction will ensure that New York families have more money in their pockets, get much-needed tax relief and will once again be treated fairly.”</p>
<p>New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins noted that over the last three years, “Trump&#8217;s unfair attack on Blue States has cost New Yorkers over $30 billion, while wealthy corporations saw tax breaks.”</p>
<p>“I want to thank US Congressman Mondaire Jones for his work, in conjunction with US Senator Chuck Schumer, to restore the State and Local Tax or &#8216;SALT&#8217; deduction,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer. “This federal tax law is not only double taxation, but it also unfairly targets communities like Westchester County–and every homeowner in this county is a victim. In Westchester, where the average home is valued at $691,392.00, our homes are our greatest asset and this cap is a hit to our wallet. We cannot stand for this—and we will not. We won’t stop fighting until we overturn the SALT deduction cap.”</p>
<p>In other legislative news, <em>Spectrum News</em> reported that two state lawmakers had introduced a bill to tax capital gains in New York as a means to increase taxes on the state&#8217;s wealthiest residents. The bill backed by Sen. Gustavo Rivera and Assemblyman Ron Kim that would tax investment income could raise an estimated $7 billion in revenue for the state.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Westchester County Director of Operations Joan McDonald, who also serves as the chairperson of the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, presented the draft local hire labor policy proposal to IDA Directors at a virtual meeting of the agency held on Jan. 28. McDonald said that discussion]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency has proposed a set of new local hire labor policy directives for certain development projects securing incentives from the agency. The policy is geared to ensuring projects that are approved for bond financing or other incentives from the IDA hire 85% of its construction workers from the local area.</p>
<p>Westchester County Director of Operations Joan McDonald, who also serves as the chairperson of the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, presented the draft local hire labor policy proposal to IDA Directors at a virtual meeting of the agency held on Jan. 28. McDonald said that discussion on the proposal would take place at the agency’s yet -to-be-scheduled meeting in February. She added that it is possible that the IDA could vote to approve the policy at that session.</p>
<p>While stressing that the new local hire labor policy is a proposal and could be subject to change, McDonald noted that in addition to the local hire policy, the new proposal also includes mandatory safety training, drug screening, certification of authorization and insurance requirements, certified payroll records and participation in an apprenticeship program.</p>
<p>“I think these are very good policies and should be discussed and move forward,” McDonald said. She noted that the County Executive is supportive of the policies and recommended the IDA undertake a two-step process whereby the Board would receive the draft proposal at its January session and then discuss and possibly vote on the measure at its February meeting.</p>
<p>In the draft policy, the IDA noted that construction jobs are vital to the overall employment opportunities available to county residents. The draft policy states, “The IDA believes that companies benefitting from its incentive programs should employ local laborers, mechanics, craft persons, journey workers, equipment operators, truck drivers and apprentices, including those who have returned from military service, during the construction phase of projects.”</p>
<p>The proposed regulations were the result of ongoing negotiations for at least the past two years between county government and the county’s building trades. Among some of the key components of the proposed new policy include:</p>
<p>• Applicants receiving IDA benefits shall utilize at least 85% local labor (Bronx, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester) for their approved projects; 35% of which must be Westchester County residents.</p>
<p>Applicants receiving IDA benefits and contractors on the projects would be required to keep records of local vendors, suppliers, contractors, etc. and provide certified payroll records to ensure compliance with the local hire regulations. A monitor would be retained to report to the IDA Executive Director Bridget Gibbons. All costs of the monitor would be the obligation of the applicant, according to the draft policy.</p>
<p>• At the session, Chris Spiers, director of administrative services for Westchester County, also discussed the establishment of an apprenticeship program in connection with the initiative, which the county could provide seed money for.</p>
<p>There are potential exemptions that could be granted including:</p>
<p>• Warranty issues related to installation of specialized equipment whereby the manufacturer requires installation by only approved installers;</p>
<p>• Specialized construction is required and no local contractors or construction workers have the required skills, certifications or training to perform the work;</p>
<p>• No labor is available for the project.</p>
<p>• The contractor requires the use of key or core persons such as supervisors, foremen, or construction workers having special skills that are not available in the “local labor” market.</p>
<p>• Cost Differentials: For projects whose project cost exceeds $15 million, significant cost differential in bid prices whereby the use of local labor and materials increase the subcontract or contract of a particular trade or work scope by at least 20%. The cost threshold for projects under $15 million the cost differential threshold would be 10% under the current proposal.</p>
<p>In both instances, the IDA proposal states, “Every reasonable effort should be made by the applicant and or the applicant’s contractor to get below the (20% or 10%) cost differential including, but not limited to, communicating and meeting with local construction trade organizations, such as the Westchester-Putnam Building and Construction Trades Council and other local Contractor Associations.”</p>
<p>IDA Counsel Michael Curti said that the county in crafting the local hire proposal utilized some of the components of a local-hire policy previously enacted by the Orange County (NY) Industrial Development Agency.</p>
<p>Also, at the IDA session on Jan. 28, the IDA Board approved bond financing and incentives in connection with the redevelopment of Marble Hill, a 133-unit apartment building at 100 Columbus Ave. in Tuckahoe.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Genting Group, parent company of Resorts World Catskills Casino in Monticello, confirmed that it will soon present plans to the Town of Newburgh to develop the VGM facility in an attempt to capture downstate gaming market share.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—Resorts World Catskills Casino is poised to present plans for a Video Gaming Machine (VGM) facility at the Newburgh Mall here.</p>
<p>The Genting Group, parent company of Resorts World Catskills Casino in Monticello, confirmed that it will soon present plans to the Town of Newburgh to develop the VGM facility in an attempt to capture downstate gaming market share.</p>
<p>Resorts World had floated a plan to develop a VGM facility at the former Nepera Chemical plant property in Harriman, but has since abandoned the project in favor of the Newburgh Mall due to higher than anticipated property cleanup costs at the Nepera site, according to a Facebook posting by New York State Sen. James Skoufis (D-39).</p>
<p>“After a comprehensive environmental review, the Nepera site proved to be far more contaminated than previous evaluations suggested. Due to the extensive remediation that&#8217;s necessary, the property will not be buildable for the better part of a decade,” Sen. Skoufis stated. “As such, it was in everyone&#8217;s best interest—including Woodbury&#8217;s and Harriman&#8217;s—that a new location be found for the project.”</p>
<p>He revealed that a court settlement reached between Woodbury and the Nepera owner in December 2020 resolved an ongoing tax dispute and, as part of the agreement, will prompt the owner to begin cleaning up the site with strict DEC oversight.</p>
<p>Sen. Skoufis said the Resorts World Catskills’ VGM facility in the Town of Newburgh “will revitalize a dying mall and employ hundreds of permanent, good-paying jobs with an emphasis on hiring from the City of Newburgh. Furthermore, annual local benefits will be provided to the Town of Newburgh and surrounding communities—in addition to legally required casino taxes and increased property tax payments from the mall.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for Genting confirmed the project had been moved to the Newburgh Mall, stating, “Developing a VGM facility in Orange County has, for many years, been part of Resorts World’s long-term vision for Hudson Valley and the Catskills. It will create hundreds of good-paying unions jobs, generate significant revenue for New York’s public schools, and is an important step in ensuring the long-term sustainability of Resorts World Catskills.” The spokesman added that development of the VGM facility will ensure the long-term viability of the Resorts World Catskills operations.</p>
<p>Published reports indicate plans may be presented to the Town of Newburgh later this month. The Genting spokesman stated that it is finalizing the number of Video Lottery Terminals that will be housed at the Newburgh Mall facility.</p>
<p>Approximately 200 construction jobs are expected to be created by the project and the facility, once operational, will employ between 200 to 225 employees, according to the Genting spokesperson. Construction on the project is anticipated to take between six to 12 months to complete. No development cost for the project was released.</p>
<p>The plan for the new VGM facility comes as <strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/commercial/gov-cuomo-may-push-up-timeline-on-downstate-casinos-to-deal-with-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York State contemplates moving up the timeline on the development of up to three downstate casinos in the New York metro region</a></strong>, that could include the award of full gaming licenses at Resorts World New York (at Aqueduct Racetrack) in Queens and Empire City Casino in Yonkers.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president and CEO of the Orange County Partnership, said of Resorts World’s plans in Newburgh, “Resorts World is making a monumental investment in Orange County, in the Town of Newburgh. Not only will they be hiring local labor, paying hundreds of thousands in taxes and creating good jobs, their presence will breathe new life into the Newburgh Mall reviving the corridor which will result in new opportunity. This is a win-win for all during uncertain economic times.”</p>
<p>Resorts World Catskills had operated a VGM facility at the Monticello Raceway property, but closed operations there a little over a year after it first opened the doors to the full gaming facility at Resorts World Catskills on Feb. 8, 2018.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Remain calm and carry on! Do not panic! Yes, the rumor is true. So, what am I talking about? Well, if you haven’t come out of your home, picked up a newspaper, or read a trade publication since the beginning of the pandemic, then please allow me to be the first one to inform you that…wait for it… Zillow is now a member of HGAR and a participant in our OneKey MLS.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard that correctly. Zillow is now a brokerage. While for some of you this might strike fear into your hearts, and shouts of: “The fox is in the chicken coop” or “The sky is falling,” the reality is, this is a good thing all around. We just need to understand the bigger picture and what this means. We also need to understand how we need to act to this new development.</p>
<p><strong>Zillow as a Member</strong></p>
<p>Zillow is now a licensed brokerage in the State of New York and on Oct. 8, 2020 Zillow joined HGAR as a Realtor member (as well as becoming a member of NAR and NYSAR). Thereafter, Zillow became a participant in the OneKey MLS. It currently identifies an office in Manhattan and, at the time of the writing of this article, it has two agents. If this were any other brokerage, no one would give it a second thought. But this is Zillow. It’s the company that everyone identifies as one of the go-to property search websites for the public. So, now that Zillow is a Realtor brokerage, what does that mean? Well, for starters, it means that Zillow, like all other Realtors must comply with the NAR Code of Ethics, including acting in the best interests of their clients and treating all parties fairly. They cannot make false or misleading representations in their activities or in their marketing and advertising. They must comply with New York Advertising Guidelines. They must conform with the new clear cooperation regulations and the recent “coming soon” rules. They can be brought before the Professional Standards Committee for violating the Code of Ethics or to resolve an arbitration dispute. All these things are good and will hold them, as it does all Realtors, accountable. It also pays dues and can have an equal, active voice in all its association activities, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>What will be different is that Zillow will no longer provide real estate listing information in the same way as it once did in the past. Previously, Zillow entered into individual contracts with MLS providers and brokerages to receive direct feeds from these providers. It charged agents and brokerages for various services and exposures on its website. That will now change. Like all OneKey participants, Zillow will receive an IDX feed. This feed is identical to the feed that all participants receive, and Zillow will be required to comply with the policies and guidelines established by NAR, as well as local policies, on how the IDX feed can be utilized. In short, the information they receive will be exactly the same as the information that is received by all other OneKey participants. The playing field is leveled, with one slight hiccup.</p>
<p>There will be one slight difference with Zillow’s website. We have been informed that while Zillow will have the IDX feed that will supply them with the same listing information that is received by all other participating brokerages, it will also maintain another area on its website that is separate and apart from their IDX feed. These listings will not be comingled with their IDX feed. That section(s) will contain rentals (Zillow will not subscribe to obtain rentals via the IDX feed) and For Sale by Owner (FSBO) listings. These will be paid placements. Aside from that exception, Zillow’s information and pictures will be identical to any other New York broker’s information and pictures. Its website will be just as informative as anyone else’s, aside from the rental and FSBO information.</p>
<p><strong>Disparagement and Anti-Trust Actions Against Zillow</strong></p>
<p>It is important for us to understand and remember that Zillow is now a Realtor brokerage. As such, all Realtors are required to treat it with the same amount of respect, courtesy, and ethical standards that would apply to any other member. Realtors should not disparage it in any marketing, advertising, or social media platforms, including blogs, Yelp and e-mails. Simply because it utilizes a different business model does not mean that a Realtor can criticize, snipe, or attack its agents, the brokerage, or its transactions. Failing to comport with the Code of Ethics could result in the offending party being brought before a Professional Standards panel on ethics charges and subsequently disciplined. Depending on the gravity of the offense, the Realtor could be reported to the Department of State, or worse still, sued in a court of law.</p>
<p>More important is that no Realtor or brokerage should ever discuss, allude to, or act in such a way that could be perceived as violating anti-trust laws. Anti-trust laws are state and federal laws that are designed to protect competition and eliminate artificial restrictions on competition. Such activities include, boycotting, price fixing, bid rigging and other restraint of trade activities. A Realtor should never threaten, joke or in fact refuse to work with a brokerage, show that brokerage’s properties, boycott that business, reduce its cooperating compensation, or act in any way that would detrimentally impact that other brokerage or its standing with the public simply because that brokerage operates under a different business model. A Realtor that engages in anti-trust activity could find themselves in a suit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or the New York Attorney General.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Zillow becoming a Realtor member may make others in our industry apprehensive. However, as a Realtor, Zillow commits itself to upholding all the same standards that all other association members hold important. While Zillow’s business model may differ from other brokerage’s business models, Zillow is a welcome addition to our diverse membership. All brokerages live and die by their transactions and business models and we should wish all Realtors continued success in this ever-changing industry. There’s plenty of business for everyone.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At the state level, in New York many issues are ongoing regarding Fair Housing. An anticipated Fair Housing report has been released by the State Senate that details cases of discrimination on Long Island by real estate agents. In many cases minority home seekers were steered toward one neighborhood while white home seekers were steered toward different neighborhoods. This serves to perpetuate discrimination in covert ways that are not always recognizable. </p>
<p>In some cases, the agents knew they were discriminating, and in others they may have been unknowingly discriminating. HGAR has been at the forefront of the effort to eliminate discrimination in housing. HGAR supported a bill that has since become law that gives the Department of State greater power to suspend or revoke a license if a Realtor has discriminated against someone who is part of a protected class under the law. HGAR has long supported additional Fair Housing education for licensees. </p>
<p>At the federal level, we now know the Democrats have control of both the Congress and White House. With New York U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer as Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, New York may have a better chance of getting state and local aid that could prevent massive cuts in the New York State budget. This is a critical component to fostering the recovery on a state and local level and makes it more likely that the SALT cap may be repealed or at least increased to allow tax relief for New Yorkers. Currently, the cap is at $10,000. </p>
<p>Finally, on a local level HGAR is pursuing co-op transparency amendments to the 2018 law. HGAR has sent a letter to the Westchester County legislators outlining its requests. The first request is a reason in writing mandating that a board tell the prospective purchaser/tenant why they are denying them. This would allow the buyer and the public to ascertain whether there is a pattern of discrimination by the board. HGAR is also advocating that all co-op boards must use a standard application to speed up the paperwork process. If this were to be passed, it would be a huge benefit in our efforts to make purchasing cooperative housing transparent. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates on these issues. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[The bills advanced will implement fair housing practices, implicit bias training, compensatory relief to victims of housing discrimination, create an anti-discrimination housing fund, and increase required training, Democratic state lawmakers stated.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The leadership of the State Senate Democratic Majority announced on Feb. 8 it will advance major legislation to continue addressing housing discrimination across New York State. The legislative package was created following two public hearings on housing discrimination that included 25 subpoenas. The package of bills is also in response to legislative suggestions outlined in the Senate Majority’s 97-page investigative report on fair housing and discrimination on Long Island released on Jan. 27, 2021 in response to investigative reports published in <em>Newsday</em> in late 2019.</p>
<p>HGAR Government Affairs Director Phil Weiden reported on Feb. 11 that all 11 bills had passed the Senate and await action in the Assembly. The governor has not weighed in on these proposals, he added.</p>
<p>The bills advanced will implement fair housing practices, implicit bias training, compensatory relief to victims of housing discrimination, create an anti-discrimination housing fund, and increase required training, Democratic state lawmakers stated.</p>
<p>“There is no place in New York for housing discrimination and predatory practices,” Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers) said. “Buying a new home should be a special achievement in a person’s life without the risk of becoming a victim of abhorrent discrimination. I am proud of the Democratic Majority Conference for holding these hearings and issuing an extensive report that has led this continued swift action to end these discriminatory practices and hold bad actors accountable.”</p>
<p>The legislation advanced by the Senate Democratic Majority includes:</p>
<p><strong>Annual Covert Fair Housing Testing:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.112 sponsored by Senator Anna Kaplan, requires the State Attorney General to conduct annual covert fair housing testing to assess compliance with fair housing laws throughout New York State.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair housing testing&#8221; would include annual covert investigations conducted for the purpose of comparing how members and non-members of a protected class are treated when they are otherwise similarly situated (similar to federal pair testing), and gathering evidence of compliance with fair housing provisions pursuant to Human Rights Law.</p>
<p><strong>Implicit Bias Training:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.538B sponsored by Senator Anna Kaplan, requires real estate brokers and salespersons to receive implicit bias training as part of their license renewal process.</p>
<p><strong>Compensatory Damages:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.715 sponsored by Senator Kevin Thomas, compels the Commissioner of the Division of Human Rights to award compensatory damages, punitive damages, or other relief to victims of housing discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Discrimination Housing Fund:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.945B sponsored by Senator Jim Gaughran, would increase the maximum fine imposed by the Department of State on real estate licensees to $2,000, and direct 50% of the fine collected to a newly created Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund to be used by the Attorney General for fair housing testing and other grants to local agencies and non-profits to fight housing discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Affirmatively Further Fair Housing:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.1353 sponsored by Senator Brian Kavanagh, establishes the state&#8217;s obligation to &#8220;Affirmatively Further Fair Housing,” which directs the commissioner and heads of all housing agencies to establish and administer housing programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Brokers:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.1448 sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman, would require that real estate salespersons and real estate brokers licensed by the Department of State legibly write their name and license number whenever required to sign a document to make it easier to identify brokers.</p>
<p><strong>Increases Required Training:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.2132B sponsored by Senator James Skoufis, requires additional testing and training for initial licensing of brokers and salespeople, including specific courses on fair housing laws, the legacy of segregation, and anti-bias training, and requires licensing course faculty to certify that curriculum complies with Department of State regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Standardized Client Procedures:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.2131A sponsored by Senator James Skoufis, requires standardized client intake procedures for real estate brokers.</p>
<p><strong>Surcharge Fee:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.2133A sponsored by Senator Skoufis, adds a surcharge to the fee paid for issuing or reissuing a real estate broker or salesmen license and directs the new funds to be used for fair housing testing by the Attorney General.</p>
<p><strong>Statutory Obligations of Oversight</strong>: This legislation, Senate Bill S.2157A sponsored by Senator Kevin Thomas, requires associate real estate brokers serving as real estate officer managers to exercise supervision over other associate brokers and real estate salesmen.</p>
<p><strong>Client Demographic Data:</strong> This legislation, Senate Bill S.2525A sponsored by Senator Brian Kavanagh, requires real estate brokers to compile client demographic data and submit it to the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>In November 2019, <em>Newsday</em> released an investigative report proving that Black home buyers were being discriminated against. The report found that real estate agents provided an average of 50% more listings than they gave to black counterparts—39 compared with 26. In response, the legislature took swift action to pass Senate Bill S.6874A, sponsored by Senator Gaughran, to penalize licensed real estate brokers and salespersons by revoking or suspending their licenses, or issuing a fine if they violate the Human Rights Law, which includes housing discrimination.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Jan. 8th, the U.S. Department of Labor issued its final rule (“Final Rule”) clarifying the standard for employee versus independent contractor status under the Fair Labor Standards Act (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/371n8rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/371n8rp</a>). The new rule was set to go into effect on March 8th, however, the Biden administration has delayed the rule’s effective date to May 7th. It may ultimately be withdrawn altogether. Whether or not the Final Rule goes into effect, it is important to review it and the independent contractor versus employee analysis as it relates to the real estate industry.</p>
<p>In New York, and nationwide, it is a widely accepted practice for real estate salespersons to be treated as independent contractors. Over the years there has been litigation brought against brokerage firms because agents have been requested to fulfill mandatory office hours, complete mandatory training and undertake other office responsibilities (e.g., answer phones, attend to the reception desk, etc.) that have traditionally been fulfilled by office staff rather than salespersons. This article will address the state of the law, particularly federal and New York law, as it applies to employment classification.</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. Department of Labor’s Final Rule</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor issued a press release (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3de6Nnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3de6Nnd</a>) wherein it summarizes the salient features of the Final Rule as follows:</p>
<p>• Reaffirms an “economic reality” test to determine whether an individual is in business for him or herself (independent contractor) or is economically dependent on a potential employer for work (FLSA employee).</p>
<p>• Identifies and explains two “core factors” that are most probative to the question of whether a worker is economically dependent on someone else’s business or is in business for him or herself:</p>
<p>• The nature and degree of control over the work.</p>
<p>• The worker’s opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment.</p>
<p>Identifies three other factors that may serve as additional guideposts in the analysis, particularly when the two core factors do not point to the same classification. The factors are:</p>
<p>• The amount of skill required for the work.</p>
<p>• The degree of permanence of the working relationship between the worker and the potential employer.</p>
<p>• Whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.</p>
<p>The actual practice of the worker and the potential employer is more relevant than what may be contractually or theoretically possible.</p>
<p>• Provides six fact-specific examples applying the factors.</p>
<p><strong>Review of the ‘Eleven Factor’ IRS Independent Contractor Test</strong></p>
<p>Although the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) had previously used the “Twenty Factor” test, for purposes of determining whether a worker should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor, in an attempt the streamline the test, the IRS now uses the “Eleven Factor” test. These factors are also known as the “common law” rules (i.e., rules that have come into existence through the years from the case law and are not actual statutory rules passed by Congress or a state legislative body). The “Eleven Factor” test is organized into three categories: “behavioral control, financial control and the relationship of the parties.” (<em>See</em> <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf</a>). Below are relevant excerpts taken from Publication 15-A issued by the IRS entitled “Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide,” which detail and explain the 11 factors.</p>
<p>In the “behavioral control” category there are two distinct factors an employer needs to consider when determining whether there is an “employee” or “independent contractor” relationship:</p>
<p><em>1. Instructions that the business gives to the worker.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Training that the business gives to the worker.</em></p>
<p>The IRS explains that “[t]he key consideration is whether the business has retained the right to control the details of a worker&#8217;s performance or instead has given up that right.”</p>
<p>The next category focuses on “financial control.” In this category, an employer must assess whether the business has a “right to control” the business aspects of the worker&#8217;s job and the extent to which those controls exist. An employer must consider the following:</p>
<p><em>3. The extent to which the worker has unreimbursed business expenses.</em></p>
<p><em>4. The extent of the worker&#8217;s investment.</em></p>
<p><em>5. The extent to which the worker makes services available to the relevant market.</em></p>
<p><em>6. How the business pays the worker.</em></p>
<p><em>7. The extent to which the worker can realize a profit or loss.</em></p>
<p>Finally, an employer must determine the “type of relationship” that exists, based upon the following remaining factors:</p>
<p><em>8. Written contracts describing the relationship the parties intended to create.</em></p>
<p><em>9. Whether the business provides the worker with employee-type benefits, such as insurance, a pension plan, vacation pay, or sick pay.</em></p>
<p><em>10. The permanency of the relationship.</em></p>
<p><em>11. The extent to which services performed by the worker are a key aspect of the regular business of the company.</em></p>
<p>Every employer, including Brokers, should review each of the above factors carefully when determining how a particular worker is classified.</p>
<p><strong>IRS: Licensed Real Estate Agents Are ‘Statutory Nonemployees’—What Does This Mean?</strong></p>
<p>In Publication 15-A, the IRS also points out that licensed real estate agents are “statutory nonemployees.” It provides that licensed real estate salespersons are treated as self-employed for all federal tax purposes, including income and employment taxes, if the payments to them are based on sales, rather than hours works, and there is a written contract for their services which provides that they will not be treated as employees for federal tax purposes.</p>
<p>The fact that the IRS designates licensed real estate salespersons as “statutory nonemployees” does not mean that they are automatically deemed to be independent contractors. Brokers must still apply the “Eleven Factor” test in determining whether the salesperson is an employee or an independent contractor.</p>
<p><strong>New York State &#8216;Carve Out&#8217; Under Section 201(6) of Workers’ Compensation Law</strong></p>
<p>New York State provides for an important “carve out” under the Workers’ Compensation Law (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/2Z9Havw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2Z9Havw</a>). Section 201(6) that specifically provides that the term “employment” will not include the services of a licensed real estate broker or sales associate if three requirements are met: “…(a) substantially all of the remuneration (whether or not paid in cash) for the services performed by such broker or sales associate is directly related to sales or other output (including the performance of services) rather than to the number of hours worked;  (b) the services performed by the broker or sales associate are performed pursuant to a written contract executed between such broker or sales associate and the person for whom the services are performed within the past 12 to 15 months;  and (c) the written contract provided for in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph was not executed under duress….” Section 201(6) further requires that in connection with subsection (c) above, the written agreement include additional provisions summarized as follows:</p>
<p>• the person, whether broker or salesperson (the “agent”), is engaged as an independent contractor associated with the firm for services performed in accordance with Article 12-A of the RPL, for all purposes, including among others, federal and state taxation, withholding, unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation;</p>
<p>• the agent shall be paid a commission for the gross sale, without deducting taxes, shall not receive any remuneration related to the number of hours worked; and shall not be treated as an employee, but as an independent contractor for federal and state tax purposes;</p>
<p>• the agent shall be permitted to work any hours he or she chooses;</p>
<p>• the agent shall be permitted to work from home or the office of the person for whom services are performed;</p>
<p>• the agent shall be free to engage in outside employment;</p>
<p>• office facilities and supplies may be provided by the firm for the use of the agent, but the agent shall otherwise bear his or her own expenses (i.e., automobile, travel, entertainment expenses, etc.);</p>
<p>• that the firm and the agent shall comply with the requirements of Article 12-A of the RPL, but such compliance shall not affect the agent’s independent contractor status nor will it be deemed that agent is an employee of the firm for any purpose whatsoever; and</p>
<p>• that the agreement and relationship may be terminated by either party thereto at any time upon notice given to the other.</p>
<p>While New York law does provide for this specific “carve out,” brokers must be sure to adhere to the requirements outlined above and also be sure to comply with the IRS “Eleven Factor” test.</p>
<p><strong>New York City ‘Freelancers’ Clarification and the Independent Contractor Agreement</strong></p>
<p>For brokers operating in New York City, it is recommended that additional language be added to the independent contractor agreement pursuant to New York City Administrative Code Title 20: Consumer Affairs, Chapter 10: Freelance Workers (FIFA) (<em>see</em> <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/374AjaT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.nyc.gov/374AjaT</a>). Any independent contractor agreement should clarify that the term “Sales Associate” or “Licensed Real Estate Salesperson” shall be deemed to mean “Freelance Worker” and the term “Broker” shall also mean “Hiring Party” as defined in §20-927 of the New York City Administrative Code.</p>
<p>The New York State Association of Realtors, Inc. also recommends that the following additional provisions be added to the form of independent contractor agreement:</p>
<p>• The Sales Associate/Freelance Worker will provide the following services for the Broker/Hiring Party: lists for sale, sells, at auction or otherwise, exchanges, buys or rents, or offers or attempts to negotiate a sale, at auction or otherwise, exchange, purchase or rental of an estate or interest in real estate, or collects or offers or attempts to collect rent for the use of real estate, or negotiates or offers or attempts to negotiate, a loan secured or to be secured by a mortgage, other than a residential mortgage loan, as defined in §590 of the Banking Law, or other incumbrance upon or transfer of real estate, or is engaged in the business of a tenant relocator, as defined in §590 of the Real Property Law or who, notwithstanding any other provision of law, performs any of the above stated functions with respect to the resale of condominium property originally sold pursuant to the provisions of the General Business Law governing real estate syndication offerings. In the sale of lots pursuant to the provisions of Article 9-A of the Real Property Law employed by or on behalf of the owner or owners of lots or other parcels of real estate, to sell such real estate, or any parts thereof, in lots or other parcels, and who shall sell or exchange, or offer or attempt or agree to negotiate the sale or exchange, of any such lot or parcel of real estate.</p>
<p>Sales Associate/Freelance Worker shall be paid:</p>
<p>a. a commission on Sales Associate/Freelance Worker’s sales, if any, without deduction for taxes, which commission shall be directly related to sales or other output;</p>
<p>b. when the Sales Associate/Freelance Worker is the “procuring cause” of the transaction;</p>
<p>c. within 30 days of the receipt of the full commission paid to the Broker/Hiring Party for the transaction; and</p>
<p>d. pursuant to a separate “Commission Agreement” between the Sales Associate/Freelance Worker and Broker/Hiring Party.</p>
<p>• Broker shall not threaten, intimidate, discipline, harass, deny a work opportunity to or discriminate against a Sales Associate/Freelance Worker, or take any other action that penalizes a Sales Associate/Freelance Worker for, or is reasonably likely to deter a Sales Associate/Freelance Worker from, exercising or attempting to exercise any right guaranteed under this chapter, or from obtaining future work opportunity because the Sales Associate/Freelance Worker has done so.</p>
<p>Additionally, language should be included clarifying that the “Sales Associate/Freelance Worker” is an independent contractor and that nothing contained in the agreement shall be construed to create an employer/employee relationship of any kind, directly or inferred.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate Salespersons as Independent Contractors</strong></p>
<p>While real estate salespersons have been traditionally characterized as independent contractors, federal law and state laws all vary. Therefore, before hiring any salesperson it is important for a brokerage firm to determine what the salesperson’s duties and functions will be. If, after a careful review of the IRS factors, applicable state laws and the case law, there still remains a question as to whether a salesperson should be classified as an employee or independent contractor, or in some circumstances both, then the broker should engage legal counsel. It is crucial for brokers to be aware of any changes in the independent contractor laws.</p>
<p>If it is found that a worker has been misclassified, the penalties and interest may be severe. However, even where an employer may have misclassified its workers, all hope is not lost, at least on the federal level. There is a “safe harbor” provision under Section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code and also the “Voluntary Classification Settlement Program” offered by the IRS, which may provide some relief to employers provided certain conditions are met (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3aOYVFI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3aOYVFI</a>).</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This month, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> talks with Westchester County Executive George Latimer, who recently announced he would be seeking a second term of office.</p>
<p>As the COVID pandemic drags on and the county’s death toll topped 2,000 residents earlier this month, the County Executive has had to deal with a host of issues in addition to the health and financial fallout the virus has caused, such as the future of Rye Playland, the need to develop more than 11,000 units of affordable housing, as well as the need to address discriminatory practices in the cooperative housing sector to name just a few.</p>
<p>Latimer, a native of Mount Vernon, has been a resident of Rye for nearly 30 years. The County Executive has extensive experience in both the public and private sectors. Latimer’s private sector experience spanned more than 20 years at major corporate subsidiaries of Nestle, and ITT, with on-site responsibilities for projects with AT&amp;T, IBM and Shearson Lehman.</p>
<p>He began his political career on the Rye City Council, then successfully ran for a seat on the Westchester County Board of Legislators where he served for 13 years, including from 1998 to 2001 as the first Democratic Chairman of the County Board. In 2004, he was elected to the New York State Assembly and then in November 2012 won a seat on the New York State Senate, representing the 37th District. In November 2017 he defeated incumbent Westchester County Executive Robert Astorino.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Realtors and some county lawmakers believe that the co-op buying process needs to be reformed to include requiring co-op Boards to state in writing why a prospective buyer was denied. Are you in favor of that change to the current county regulations?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/latimerribbonsstanding.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-35531" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/latimerribbonsstanding.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Latimer:</strong> I think it is a debatable issue before the County Board and they look at all sides of it. On one side of it, you certainly don’t want discrimination. You don’t want people to say we don’t want you in our building because of your ethnicity, your religion or what have you. I think that’s a reprehensible way to factor people out. On the other hand, you will hear from co-op officials that they are looking for people that they think will fit into something where you actually own shares; you are not just renting an apartment, you are actually becoming a part of the infrastructure that operates the building and you want to have a person you think you can work with.</p>
<p>So, I don’t know what the balance point is. We originally had a referral mechanism when we did the last reform two years ago, which tightened the time frame that they (co-op Boards) had to respond, which I thought was good, and then a requirement of a referral to the Human Rights Commission. I don’t know how many cases there were—pure human rights violations—and I think that’s the key. If it is apparent that there is consistent rejection of co-op applications because of race or gender or religion, then the reform will be necessary. But, if we are finding that the rejection is not prejudicial, it may be judgmental, but is not prejudicial, then it falls under a different category and let that be the debate.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth.</strong> With the recent settlement with Standard Amusements, what can you tell us in terms of the future management and improvements planned at Rye Playland?</p>
<p><strong>Latimer:</strong> Well, the county is committed to putting in well over $100 million worth of improvements to the park. The county continues to own the facility, even though Standard (Amusements) will have a 30-year arrangement to manage it. We want to see the park thrive. We want to see kids come there, grow the attendance and grow the experience and the enjoyment like it once was. So, at the end of the day that is our mission and we are going to work with Standard to try and accomplish that. Now, they have the position of the primary authority and responsibility and management of the park, that is what (former Westchester County Executive) Rob Astorino signed in the deal and that is what is going to happen. We are certainly going to be involved financially and we are going to be involved as an active partner, not a passive partner, and the hope is that Playland will improve demonstrably and people will see it, feel it and enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Standard is contractually obligated to spend more than $30 million in primarily ride and new feature-oriented improvements to the park, while the county’s $100 million will be focused more on infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> While you held down tax increases in this year’s budget despite the pandemic, some have said that COVID relief funding from the federal government was critical in achieving that result. Do you agree and could you tell us what measures you would have taken and what tax increase the county would have been forced to impose without such federal aid?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/George-Latimer1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35529 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/George-Latimer1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="256" /></a><strong>Latimer:</strong> Well, the federal aid helped us handle the excessive expenditures that we received because of COVID. If we had the excessive expenditures and we didn’t have any additional aid, then we would have spent significantly more money and could have very easily had a 5% increase in property taxes, without question. You are talking about overtime in the Health Department, overtime in the police and corrections departments. Just imagine, you have so many police on post, a group of guys get COVID and so you can’t hire police like substitute teachers, so you have guys work overtime. And when they work overtime, they get time and a half or double time and that cost goes through the roof because a wide variety of people get COVID on and off the shift and they are infecting other people. So, to have the coronavirus aid money cover that got our costs back closer to normal. And to have money from coronavirus (aid funding) that we used to help us stabilize businesses, in fact helped them stabilize. And they did a little better in sales tax revenue than we would have received if we did none of that. We thought the sales tax revenue was going to be disastrous, a total crash, while it went down, it wasn’t of the same magnitude (the county had predicted). So, we were able to realize a little bit better result on sales taxes.</p>
<p>Those are examples of how the coronavirus money helped us and I think the bottom line is this—all factors being equal, we could have used the coronavirus as an excuse to raise taxes, but we didn’t. The very smart people that we have working in this government figured out how to balance the budget honestly and honorably and then at the same time cut taxes a little bit, not a huge amount, but cut it a little bit and also meet all of our obligations. I think that is smart management. Let’s be candid. When I ran for office, the argument on the other side of the aisle was always that if you elect a Democrat you are going to raise taxes. Watch out for the Democrat, he is going to raise taxes. We just cut county property taxes two consecutive years—the first time in 20 years. So, I guess the rhetoric does not match up with the reality. The reality is that we understand that taxes, property taxes particularly, are problematic and we have to try and keep them under control and the last two years I think we should get credit for what we did.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> I know one of the key issues you have advanced is the need for more affordable housing in Westchester County. The <em>Journal News</em> reported that a study from your office last year found that 11,700 new affordable housing units are needed to address needs in Westchester. The study also found a total of 82,451 units require affordability relief. Can you spell out how the county is addressing this critical need for so many in Westchester?</p>
<p><strong>Latimer:</strong> Well, the first thing is the county has faced up to the need, because for the prior administration, affordable housing was not seen as what their responsibilities were. They fought the HUD lawsuit and then they <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/George-Latimer2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35528 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/George-Latimer2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="287" /></a>obviously had to accept the final settlement and develop 750 units of housing to satisfy the settlement. We walked in the door and we believed in affordable housing and we embraced it. We are the ones that authorized the (affordable housing) study. We didn’t have to, there was no mandate to do it and then once you see the study come out and you see the need of 11,000-plus units, it tells you this isn’t about getting 750 units to satisfy the court case and then you are done. You haven’t begun being done and that I think is a factor.</p>
<p>Right now, we are working on in some way shape or form on about 1,400 units of affordable housing, which is slightly above 10% of what that goal is. We think we can juice that up higher, but again we are operating in a pandemic, so while certain projects were underway before the pandemic hit, projects that would start from scratch have been kind of bumped off to the side because the pandemic freezes up capital and freezes up a number of other things that are necessary to move forward. But, we are working it.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> County Executive Latimer provided updates on a number of affordable housing projects including a 36-unit building in Port Chester, a 75-unit WestHELP project and a housing development in Peekskill to be developed by Wilder-Balter Partners.</p>
<p>He concluded his remarks on the affordable housing issue by saying, “Do I think we have a long way to go? We have a long way to go, but I think we are committed to making the journey and the process and we have started and we are on the road (to addressing the affordable housing problem in Westchester.)</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In looking back on the past 11 months of the pandemic, is there any event or moment that affected you personally the most and has there been anything positive to come out of this that you can point to?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Latimer-with-Cuomo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-35530" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Latimer-with-Cuomo.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Latimer:</strong> Very early on in the process, I had heard that a fellow by the name of Glenn Bellitto had contracted COVID. Glenn was an Eastchester Councilman, a Republican. There was a time we had the same dentist, so I must have met him conservatively close to 30 years ago and neither he nor I were involved in politics when we first met. I liked him. He was a nice guy. We chatted a little bit and got to know each other and over time we found ourselves, when I became a (State) Senator when I represented Eastchester and he was on the Board, we would be at some Eastchester community events and so forth. He contracted COVID, got very sick and died within a week (on April 2, 2020 at the age of 62). When I heard that I shook. He was a couple of years younger than I, not a lot, but a couple of years younger, and I was shocked by it, I couldn’t believe it. This was very early in the pandemic and he was probably the first fatality of anybody I knew and of course I have come to know others since then. He was not in his advanced years, he was not in a nursing home, he did not to my observation have any comorbidities. Like I am, he was a little overweight, but he was just a really great guy. And that struck me and what it did was, it turned the pandemic from a discussion of this is a health care crisis and we have to have process, this turned into this is a person I know has died. And from moment in time I took it very seriously. And at that time, on a national level there was a lot of minimizing the threat. ‘Oh, it’s not that bad. ‘Oh, it’s going to be like the flu.’ ‘Oh, it’s just being used to try defeat me in the election.’ But, I knew that wasn’t true because it had already cost somebody that I knew. And so, I think from that point forward, and I don’t try and present myself as some superior leader, I think I am a good guy, I work hard and I try to do my job every day, but I took this thing seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Some positives the County Executive pointed to since the pandemic began included the emergence of Zoom as a means to conduct operations safely, as well as the opening of some parks and golf courses. He noted that this past summer, the county’s six public golf courses had the most rounds of golf played in their history.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Minority homeownership continues to stubbornly lag behind the national rate, with Black Americans facing some of the toughest hurdles to achieving this essential part of the American Dream, according to a report released recently by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>The homeownership rate for Black Americans—42%—is nearly 30% less than the rate for white Americans at 69.8%. The U.S. homeownership rate stands at 64.2%, with the rates for Asian and Hispanic Americans at 60.7% and 48.1%, respectively.</p>
<p>The NAR report states that the Black homeownership rate in New York State is 31%, while the homeownership rate for white Americans in New York is 63%. The disparity is wide as well in surrounding states. For example. in Connecticut the Black homeownership rate as compared to whites is 71% to 40%, while in New Jersey the rate differential is 70% to 38%.</p>
<p>NAR&#8217;s “Snapshot of Race &amp; Home Buying in America” report examines the homeownership rate among each race in 2019 using American Community Survey data by state and the changes in the homeownership rate by race from 2009 to 2019. Using the Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers data from 2020, the report looks into the characteristics of who purchases homes, why they purchase, what they purchase, and the financial background for buyers based on race.</p>
<p>&#8220;This data reinforces the need to implement key policy initiatives NAR developed in concert with the Urban Institute and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers to address the Black homeownership gap,&#8221; said NAR President Charlie Oppler, a Realtor from Franklin Lakes, NJ, and the CEO of Prominent Properties Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty. &#8220;Specifically, this five-point plan developed in 2019 calls on the nation to: advance policy solutions at the local level; tackle housing supply constraints and affordability; promote an equitable and accessible housing finance system; provide further outreach and counseling initiatives for renters and mortgage-ready millennials; and focus on sustainable homeownership and preservation initiatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding home affordability nationwide, 43% of Black households can afford to buy the typical home compared to 63% of white households, 71% of Asian households and 54% of Hispanic households, according to the study. Wide variances in affordability exist by state, NAR reported.</p>
<p>For example, more than 60% of Black households can afford to buy a home in Alaska, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Vermont. However, less than a third of Black households can afford to purchase a home in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington state, Wyoming and the District of Columbia. There are only four states where less than half of white households can afford to buy a home: California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington state. More than half of Asian households can afford to purchase a home in all but six states – California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming – and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of Asian Americans—23%—and one in five Hispanic Americans—18%—purchased a multi-generational home, with &#8220;spending time with aging parents&#8221; and &#8220;saving money&#8221; listed as the primary reasons for those decisions. Fifteen percent of Black Americans and 10% of white Americans bought a multi-generational home as both segments said a top driver was adult children or relatives moving back into the home. Black and Asian Americans were more likely to say that &#8220;wanting a larger home that multiple incomes could afford together&#8221; was an important reason for buying a multi-generational home.</p>
<p>Black households are more than twice as likely than white households to have student loan debt—43% vs. 21%—with a median student loan debt for Black households of $40,000 compared to $30,000 for white households. For home buyers with student debt, it is one of the major hurdles for saving for a down payment. Black applicants were rejected for mortgage loans at a rate 2.5 times greater than white applicants—10% vs. 4%, respectively, the NAR report stated.</p>
<p>Black Americans and Hispanic Americans—15% and 10%—were three and two times as likely, respectively, than white and Asian Americans—5% each—to tap into their 401(k) or pension funds as a down payment source for a home purchase. Conversely, almost four out of 10 white Americans—37%—used the funds from the sale of their primary residence to serve as a down payment for a home compared to only 21% of Hispanic, 18% of Asian and 17% of Black Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The residential housing market&#8217;s strong performance during the pandemic helped homeowners enjoy a significant increase in wealth via approximately $1 trillion in additional home equity over the last year,&#8221; said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. &#8220;However, as indicative of the K-shaped economic recovery, greater numbers of potential first-time homebuyers—many of whom are minorities—are feeling discouraged by disproportionate job losses. Essentially, they&#8217;re being priced out of owning a home because of rapidly rising home prices resulting from historically-low housing inventory. For Black Americans, in general, the greater likelihood of having student loan debt, combined with lower household incomes and accrued savings when compared to the national average, adds to the challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>NAR believes policy proposals such as the Biden administration&#8217;s first-time buyer tax credit of up to $15,000 would help address many of these underlying problems. Under the proposal, home buyers would receive the tax credit when making the home purchase, rather than having to wait until filing federal income taxes the following year. NAR also believes the first-time buyer tax credit should be accompanied with incentives to create more affordable housing units to prevent the credit from further aggravating the current shortage.</p>
<p>The study noted that for those who said they witnessed or experienced discrimination in a real estate transaction, 41% of Black respondents said they face stricter requirements because of their race. That compares to 27% of Asian respondents, 19% of Hispanic respondents and 16% white respondents. Approximately one-third of Black homebuyers and a quarter of Asian homebuyers said they witnessed or experienced discrimination with the type of loan product offered.</p>
<p>Approximately seven in 10 white Americans said they purchased a home in a neighborhood where the majority of the residents were of the same race. However, only about a quarter of Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans said the same.</p>
<p>NAR officials stated the association is working to ensure Realtors are active leaders in the fight against bias and discrimination. Last year, NAR began implementing its fair housing &#8220;ACT&#8221; plan, which emphasizes Accountability, Culture Change, and Training. As a part of this plan, NAR released a new interactive training platform—Fairhaven—designed to help combat discrimination in America&#8217;s real estate market. In addition, NAR developed an implicit bias training video with strategies to help Realtors override biases in their daily interactions.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—Representatives of Genting Americas, the parent company of Resorts World Catskills casino in Monticello, officially presented plans to the Newburgh Town Board on Feb. 22 to locate a Video Gaming Machine facility at the Newburgh Mall here.</p>
<p>The $32-million “Resorts World Hudson Valley” project would convert 90,000-square-foot of space, including the now vacant Bon Ton Department store into the VGM facility that would feature approximately 1,300 VGMs and Resort World’s signature lounge—Bar 360.</p>
<p>The proposed VGM facility at the 388,000 square foot regional shopping center that is located at the crossroads of Interstates 84 and 87 at the intersection of Route 300, would be leased from the mall property owner. Resorts World Hudson Valley states it would contribute $3 million annually through a Host Community Benefit Agreement to the Town of Newburgh and an estimated $65 million annually to support public schools through statutory payments to the New York Lottery Education Fund.</p>
<p>Other economic benefits of the project touted by Genting include: approximately 215 new full-time jobs, the large majority of which would be union employees, and an additional 200 construction jobs. The average annual wage for full time employees would be $72,000/year (including salary and benefits), the company stated.</p>
<p>Resorts World had floated a plan to develop a VGM facility at the former Nepera Chemical plant property in Harriman, but has since abandoned the project in favor of the Newburgh Mall due to higher than anticipated property cleanup costs at the Nepera site, according to a Facebook posting by New York State Sen. James Skoufis (D-39). That project had been estimated to cost approximately $100 million to develop.</p>
<p>Senator Skoufis said, “When Resorts World first approached me nearly two years ago seeking support for a proposal to bring a gaming center to Orange County, I made my priorities clear to them: jobs, revitalizing a blight, and local community benefits. This project does all three.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We are elated at the opportunity to help revitalize the Newburgh Mall, create good-paying union jobs for local residents, and generate significant revenue for New York State’s public schools,” said Bob DeSalvio, president of Genting Americas East. “This potential investment and our vision for what we seek to develop and build with Resorts World Hudson Valley underscores our unwavering commitment to the communities in this region and our strong belief that the best days are ahead of us.”</p>
<p>Genting Americas currently operates Resorts World New York City and Resorts World Catskills, employing more than 2,000 union members between the two properties. Since opening in 2011, RWNY has generated more than $3 billion for New York’s public schools through the Lottery’s education fund.</p>
<p>A host of public and business officials released statements of support for the project, including Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, who said, “The proposed plans for Resorts World Hudson Valley delivers on the commitment Genting made to Orange County. It is an investment in jobs, in growth and in the future of Orange County, and it will have an immediate—and positive—impact at a time when we need it the most.”</p>
<p>Town of Newburgh Supervisor Gil Piaquadio added, “We look forward to working with Resorts World through the process to create a new destination in Newburgh that benefits residents and small businesses alike.”</p>
<p>Orange County Partnership President Maureen Halahan noted, “Resorts World is making a monumental investment in Orange County, in the Town of Newburgh. Not only will they be hiring local labor, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and creating good jobs, their presence will breathe new life into the Newburgh Mall, reviving the corridor which will result in new opportunity. This is a win-win for all during uncertain economic times.”</p>
<p>Todd Diorio, president of the Hudson Valley Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, said, “We are focused on getting our members back to work after our economy was crippled by the pandemic and this project accomplishes exactly that. Genting has always been a great partner for the union trades and we look forward to continuing to build upon that relationship with the construction of Resorts World Hudson Valley.”</p>
<p>It is not known at press time if Genting and the Hudson Valley Building &amp; Construction Trades Council have negotiated a Project Labor Agreement on the project, as it did with the construction of Resorts World Catskills in Monticello.</p>
<p>Genting Americas currently operates Resorts World New York City and Resorts World Catskills, employing more than 2,000 union members between the two properties.</p>
<p>Resorts World Catskills casino resort in Monticello includes an 18-story all-suite hotel, and a casino featuring 100,000 square feet of gaming space, including 150 live Las-Vegas style table games, 1,600 state-of-the art slot machines, a poker room, private gaming salons and a 100-seat sportsbook lounge. The casino resort also offers 10 varied bar and restaurant experiences, which includes an Italian steakhouse created by celebrity chef Scott Conant, and year-round live entertainment at the 2,500-seat RW Epicenter, casino bars and lounges.</p>
<p>The hotel located within Resorts World Catskills is comprised of 332 suites, the Crystal Life Spa, two indoor pools, and two fitness centers. The integrated casino resort also includes additional stay and play destinations on its campus, including The Alder, an adjacent 101-room lifestyle hotel featuring the first Topgolf Swing Suites in New York State, and Dos Gatos, a cantina-style Mexican eatery and the recently opened Kartrite Resort and Indoor Waterpark, and will be expanded to include a Rees Jones redesigned golf course.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Patricia Dantzic admits she was a bit apprehensive about re-entering the workforce with a new career in real estate. After enjoying a successful profession in corporate communications in the music industry, she switched gears, earned her license and began working at a local agency.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, she was approached by a team member from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Hudson Valley Properties and quickly decided that joining that team would be the best way to help her jump-start her new business. For the past year, Dantzic has been part of the firm’s Clement, Brooks &amp; Safier Team and works from their Rhinebeck office. “Even with all of my business experience, I found real estate to be somewhat intimidating and being part of a team is very reassuring for me,” she explained. “I’m working with a great group of professionals intent on having my back.”</p>
<p>COVID hit not long after Dantzic joined the team, and that’s when she realized the true benefits of being part of a team. “I would have really been on my own then, since no one was coming into the office,” she said. “At first I didn’t know anything about teams and it I took me a while to wrap my head around this, but I knew I could learn from the group and I’ve gotten so much more than I ever expected.” Dantzic has had the opportunity to list, sell, and be involved with just about every other aspect of a real estate transaction.</p>
<p>Last year, the team closed more than $50 million in sales, and Hayes Clement, along with his two partners, Donna Brooks and Harris Safier, hope to keep increase that number for 2021. Clement explained that the team is fairly new, but has already exceeded their own expectations. “Collectively, we can spend more than we could do as solo agents, so that helps our marketing budgets along with everything else,” he said. “Plus, operating as a team means we’re able to take a weekend off and still have someone there to service our clients.”</p>
<p>The team, consisting currently of 11 agents, is organized as a corporate entity within their Berkshire Hathaway brokerage, which has offices in New Paltz, Kingston and Rhinebeck. “Everyone has a mix of responsibilities and different team members have expertise in different areas,” explained Clement. “Some are stronger with listings, while others are stronger working with buyers.”</p>
<p>Many also find being part of a team has been a huge asset during COVID, with almost everyone working from home. “We usually have one or two meetings a week, training, and comradery,” said Clement. “Just making those connections via teleconference helps us bounce ideas off each other and creates a bonding you wouldn’t get on your own.”</p>
<div id="attachment_35607" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4073.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35607" class="wp-image-35607" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4073.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-35607" class="wp-caption-text">From left, JoEllen Sandy, Christina Stevens, Andrew Bushay and Samantha Torres of the Christina Stevens Team at Laujel Real Estate in the Bronx.</p></div>
<p>Clement believes teams are here to stay and expects to see more of them, as the pandemic has caused us to eschew large gatherings, particularly in offices and other social arenas. “For agents like Dantzic, who are new to the business, teams can offer big savings. “It’s tough for those just starting out—it can be a large investment of money and time. For seasoned agents, teams are a nice in-between step from working alone to owning your own brokerage,” added Clement.</p>
<p>Dantzic believes education is the biggest asset of being a team member. “We have weekly meetings and training sessions, and I’ve gotten many leads as a result of this,” she added. “I’ve also had the opportunity to observe different business styles and the knowledge and experience I’ve gained is invaluable.” Most appealing to Dantzic is the team motto, which she practices daily: “Play nice and do good work.”</p>
<p>A recent National Association of Realtors study found that 26% of Realtors are now members of a partnership or real estate team. The median year that teams were established is 2014 and the median number of team members is four. The survey also found that many members joined their current team in 2016.</p>
<p>Deanne Rymarowicz, NAR Association Counsel, Legal Affairs, said teams are defined at state levels and need no permission from NAR when forming. However, all teams are subject to state rules and regulations. For example, in New York, advertising guidelines stipulate that any team advertisement must always mention the name of the brokerage.</p>
<p>“All teams are still part of a brokerage and cannot act as their own company, she explained. “An agent’s license is with the broker and not the team leader.”</p>
<p>Rymarowicz noted the many advantages that teams offer such as the ability to focus on certain aspects of a transaction, division of responsibilities, training and education, and mentoring for new agents. “However, there are some pitfalls that people need to be aware of before joining a team,” she acknowledged. “Be clear on why you want to join, review the benefits it will bring you, make sure you understand the terms of your agreement as team member, and know what your role and expectations will be.”</p>
<p>In terms of agent compensation, Rymarowicz said that will vary with each team. The NAR survey found that the most common compensation was a commission split, with 38% of survey respondents indicating some type of split. Just over 22% responded with a graduated commission split and only 13% chose a 100% commission split. “In some cases, agents’ commissions may increase after meeting a certain threshold,” she said. “Team leaders can set their own policies on compensation.”</p>
<p>The survey also found that in some cases, the team leaders handle the listings, while other team members work with buyers. In some team formats, all members are encouraged to pursue listings. In most cases, a client can contact any member of the team for assistance if one particular agent isn’t available.</p>
<p>As far as division of team responsibilities, the survey found that one agent might be in charge of handling buyer phone calls on listings and sign calls, while another might escort buyers on home-showing tours or host open houses. Another might draw up purchase offers, manage the lending process or attend home inspections.</p>
<p>One of the most successful teams in Westchester and Putnam counties is the Nancy Kennedy Team, which is part of Houlihan Lawrence, Inc. Kennedy, an associate broker in the company’s Croton-on-Hudson branch, has been in the business for more than 35 years and is consistently rated the top associate in the region in terms of dollar volume and units sold. In 2019, she achieved more than $1 billion in career sales. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has ranked Kennedy and her team as #1 in Westchester, #5 in New York State and #109 in the nation.</p>

Front row (from left): Patricia Dantzic, Jamie L. Corts, and Victoria Bourbeau Pomarico. Not pictured: Team member Kate Terkelson.</p></div>
<p>Her team, which has been in operation for 17 years, started with just a few agents. Today, the team includes her husband Paul Kennedy, Megan and Coleen Coxen, Adam Redondo, Ali Alverez and Susan Fraietta. “We are like a family,” admitted Kennedy. “Plus, my calendar books up so quickly that I often find myself meeting five or six people on Saturdays and Sundays. Having a team allows me to get a lot more accomplished, and is a great benefit to both our clients and our agents on the team.”</p>
<p>Kennedy will consider only full-time agents to be part of the team, due to the volume of work they handle. Some of the more well-known properties the team has listed and sold include the Residences at the Ritz Carlton in White Plains, Trump Plaza in New Rochelle and Trump Park in Shrub Oak. “I would consider expanding because I’m always looking for another good team member,” she shared. “But they have to want to work hard. I never felt I had a separation from my job and my life. I look for good energy and passion.”</p>
<p>Never short on leads, Kennedy distributes them among her team members. “It’s like a game of jump ball—whoever grabs it is the one who gets it,” she said. “We list and sell all types of properties from one-bedroom rental units to luxury estates and properties.</p>
<p>She describes her group as having a “real team spirit.” “We’re actually a small real estate business under a bigger umbrella,” she added.</p>
<p>Christina Stevens, broker/owner of Laujel Realty Corp. in the Bronx, has been a Realtor since 1994 and owner of her own brokerage since 1997. For the past five years, she has been leading a small team, which now consists of four people. In addition to herself, JoEllen Sandy, Ellen Fiske and Andrew Bushay make up the Christina Stevens Team. Her son, George Stevens, was also a team member, but will be relocating to Los Angeles next month.</p>
<p>“Everybody does everything on this team—listings, selling and rentals,” said Stevens. “We all help each other out and if one person is not available, another one steps in. There are no issues or problems.” Stevens said team members also negotiate compensation with each other for help with handling sales or rentals.</p>
<p>For her, having a team has been a huge asset when covering a territory that includes the Bronx, Westchester, Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. “Everyone is trained on all aspects of real estate transactions so we can accomplish goals as one,” she explained. “The trust factor we have among ourselves is awesome.”</p>
<p>Stevens also believes the team concept is here to stay, especially because her clients love the idea. “Customers should never be left unattended,” she added. “We always let them know they will never be alone.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency’s Board of Directors earlier today (Feb. 25) unanimously approved a new local hire labor policy that will require incentivized project developers hire 85% of its construction workers from the local area; require its workers complete OSHA safety training; subcontractors be enrolled in a pre-apprenticeship program and that all workers pass a drug screening prior to their hiring.</p>
<p>The new policy was the result of extensive negotiations between county government, the IDA, and the Building and Construction Trades Council of Westchester &amp; Putnam, County, Inc. in an initiative geared at ensuring local unionized labor work on development projects that secure incentive financing from the IDA. The building trades have complained that its membership has received little work from the significant amount of new development projects that receive financial incentives by the Westchester County IDA and other such agencies operating in the county due to labor policies that do not require the participation of local labor and/or adherence to state prevailing wage laws.</p>
<p>Westchester County Director of Operations Joan McDonald, who also serves as the chairperson of the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, presented the draft local hire labor policy proposal to IDA Directors at a virtual meeting of the agency held on Jan. 28. The IDA voted to approve the measure at its Feb. 25 virtual session with the new policy scheduled to take effect in 60 days.</p>
<p>In the draft policy, the IDA noted that construction jobs are vital to the overall employment opportunities available to county residents. The policy states, “The IDA believes that companies benefitting from its incentive programs should employ local laborers, mechanics, craft persons, journey workers, equipment operators, truck drivers and apprentices, including those who have returned from military service, during the construction phase of projects.”</p>
<p>McDonald specifically stated that the draft policy was agreed to in discussions held on Dec. 9 with members of the Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of Westchester &amp; Putnam Counties, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, IDA and other Westchester County government officials and John Cooney, the executive director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc. of Tarrytown.</p>
<p>“The intent is that the local labor be union labor and that the policies taken together with local hire, pre-apprenticeship programs, etc. that it be union.” McDonald said.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer said of the new IDA labor policy, “The county is seeking to strike a balance that can work for labor and the development community; to continue to incentivize worthwhile projects and to do so in a way to assist the men and women who work on these projects. We believe these new policies are measured and practical, and will help our working men and women and still ensure that our IDA benefits assist the projects that add growth to our county’s economy.”</p>
<p>Among some of the key components of the proposed new policy include:</p>
<p>• Applicants receiving IDA benefits shall utilize at least 85% local labor (Bronx, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester) for their approved projects; 35% of which must be Westchester County residents.</p>
<p>• All applicants for financing from the IDA must provide the names, contact information, certificate of authorization to do business in New York State and copies of certificates of New York Workers Compensation Insurance, State of New York Disability Insurance and General Liability Insurance of all contractors working on the project.</p>
<p>• All applicants are required to provide to the IDA proof of current OSHA 10 training certification (completed within the last five years and renewed every five years) for all construction workers on the project, as well as proof of a four-hour scaffold course for all construction workers utilizing a scaffold on an IDA project site and proof that all construction workers on the IDA project site passed a drug screening test prior to their hiring.</p>
<p>• For all approved projects, the designated construction manager for the project shall provide the IDA project monitor with a certified monthly payroll of all construction workers working on the IDA project, which will include names, days/hours worked and rate of pay and worker classification and annually certify that the IDA project is “in material compliance with state laws related to environmental quality, worker safety and protection, and wages and hours.”</p>
<p>• In order to ensure a skilled workforce, the IDA will require all IDA project subcontractors (expressly excepting the prime or general contractor) must be enrolled in a New York State-certified apprenticeship program. (“Certified Contractor”). The county in its draft documents concerning the labor policy indicated that the IDA may dedicate $50,000 to fund pre-apprenticeship programs operating in the county that provide disadvantaged individuals training and exposure to various trades. The IDA will set aside 10% of each agency fee it receives for such pre-apprenticeship programs.</p>
<p>Richard McSpedon, a member of the IDA Board and vice president of the Westchester-Putnam Central Labor Policy, proposed that developers be given an “opt-out” to the new labor policy if they negotiate and finalize a Project Labor Agreement with the Building and Construction Trades Council of Westchester &amp; Putnam, County, Inc. Chairperson McDonald said the opt-out proposal would be discussed at the IDA’s meeting in April.</p>
<p>“I think this is a great policy. I tip my hat to the Board,” McSpedon said. In proposing the opt-out provision requiring the Project Labor Agreement with the building trades, McSpedon noted that it could provide some developers relief from the new regulations and also “foster an honest dialogue between the developers and the building trades where they (developers) would see the sincerity of the trades being competitive in this market, especially when it relates to residential projects.”</p>
<p>Edward Doyle, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Westchester &amp; Putnam, County, Inc., characterized the new labor policy as “a very good start.” However, he said the new policy would not generate any new jobs for union tradesmen without the requirement of a Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>There are already potential exemptions that could be granted in the new labor policy, including:</p>
<p>• Warranty issues related to installation of specialized equipment whereby the manufacturer requires installation by only approved installers;</p>
<p>• Specialized construction is required and no local contractors or construction workers have the required skills, certifications or training to perform the work;</p>
<p>• No labor is available for the project.</p>
<p>• The contractor requires the use of key or core persons such as supervisors, foremen, or construction workers having special skills that are not available in the “local labor” market.</p>
<p>• Cost Differentials: For projects whose project cost exceeds $15 million, significant cost differential in bid prices whereby the use of local labor and materials increase the subcontract or contract of a particular trade or work scope by at least 20%. The cost threshold for projects under $15 million, the cost differential threshold would be 10%.</p>
<p>In both instances, the IDA proposal states, “Every reasonable effort should be made by the applicant and or the applicant’s contractor to get below the (20% or 10%) cost differential including, but not limited to, communicating and meeting with local construction trade organizations, such as the Westchester-Putnam Building and Construction Trades Council and other local Contractor Associations.”</p>
<p>IDA Chairman McDonald said the new labor policy was crafted after similar regulations imposed by other neighboring IDAs, including the Orange County IDA.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Feb. 25 that the state will launch a program to deploy undercover fair housing testers in New York City, Long Island, Westchester County and the Central New York and Western New York regions to possibly uncover housing discrimination practices by sellers, brokers and landlords.</p>
<p>The state is currently finalizing contracts with six nonprofit organizations to conduct testing in New York City, Long Island, Westchester County and the Central New York and Western New York regions. Testers will act as potential renters and homebuyers, state officials said. The program will be administered by New York State Homes and Community Renewal.</p>
<p>The governor also announced that new regulations (<a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/re_appraiser/update2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/re_appraiser/update2020.html</a>) concerning real estate appraisers, to help combat housing discrimination will take effect on March 17, 2021. The new regulations will require licensed and certified appraisers to receive training on fair housing and fair lending as part of their continuing education requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every New Yorker has the right to live in the community of their choice without fear of discriminatory treatment,&#8221; Gov. Cuomo said. &#8220;New York&#8217;s prohibition of discrimination in home rental and sale transactions isn&#8217;t just a suggestion—it&#8217;s the law—and any unscrupulous agents who break that law must be held accountable.”</p>
<p>He added, “These new actions build on our ongoing efforts to stop illegal housing practices by finding those bad actors who are subjecting potential renters and buyers to discrimination and putting them on notice, while also making sure real estate appraisers receive the proper training to make fair and unbiased decisions.”</p>
<p>The governor’s announcement builds on his ongoing efforts to advance the goals of the Fair Housing Act, which includes enacting the most aggressive tenant protections in New York&#8217;s history through the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019; banning source of income discrimination; and prohibiting housing providers in receipt of state funds from automatically denying applicants to housing based on negative credit or a history of justice involvement.</p>
<p>Last month, he announced the findings of a new report by the New York State Department of Financial Services on redlining in the Buffalo metropolitan area. Buffalo remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States decades after the practice of redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were banned by law. DFS&#8217; report found a distinct lack of lending by mortgage lenders, particularly non-depository lenders, continues today in Buffalo neighborhoods with majority-minority populations and to minority homebuyers in general.</p>
<p>In his State of the State message in January, Governor Cuomo continued the fight against racial injustices in the housing market with a package of reforms designed to bridge the racial divide in homeownership and tear down barriers to wealth-building. The proposal expands the reach of HCR&#8217;s State of New York Mortgage Agency and gives teeth to the fight against redlining by allowing more community-based lenders to offer SONYMA loans in low-income communities, increasing down payment assistance for borrowers in underserved areas of the state to $7,500 from $3,000, and granting SONYMA flexibility to make mortgage modifications in times of crisis so borrowers can remain in their homes, he noted.</p>
<p>These reforms, along with expanding SONYMA&#8217;s Give Us Credit program, which examines traditional measures of credit history and credit worthiness to enable more borrowers to qualify for mortgages, will go a long way toward addressing housing discrimination.</p>
<p>New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “In New York, we will continue to build more inclusive communities by ensuring fair access to housing opportunities. The governor&#8217;s initiative to expose discriminatory housing practices will make it clear that housing providers must obey the law or be held accountable. With housing insecurity on the rise, we must do all we can to protect New Yorkers from housing discrimination and safeguard their ability to find a safe, stable and affordable place to call home.”</p>
<p>New York State Division of Human Rights Interim Commissioner Johnathan Smith said, “New York State will use every tool at its disposal to eliminate the scourge of housing discrimination. This vital new effort will ensure that bad actors amongst landlords, sellers, and brokers are rooted out and held accountable under the law.”</p>
<p>New York Secretary of State Rosanna Rosado said, “Housing discrimination is illegal, and here in New York State we are committed to ensuring every New Yorker has equal access to housing. To help combat the pervasive issue of discrimination, it is essential for our licensed professionals to be continuously educated on the history and laws around fair housing. This new paired testing program, coupled with these new regulations, will help weed out the bad actors and protect all New Yorkers from biased housing practices.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The White Plains Common Council unanimously voted on Monday evening to accept the environmental findings, zoning amendment and master plan for the 16-acre former Our Lady of Good Counsel property at 52 North Broadway to allow construction of 335 independent and assisted living apartments for seniors]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A mixed-use project that has been on the drawing boards for more than five years, secured a key approval yesterday from the White Plains Common Council that could put final approvals finally within reach for the property owner.</p>
<p>The White Plains Common Council unanimously voted on Monday evening to accept the environmental findings, zoning amendment and master plan for the 16-acre former Our Lady of Good Counsel property at 52 North Broadway to allow construction of 335 independent and assisted living apartments for seniors, 28 townhouses and 48 multi-family apartments.</p>
<p>The plan by the property owner, WP Development NB LLC, led by New York City-based commercial real estate investment and development firm George Comfort &amp; Sons, has been scaled down several times since the property was acquired from The Sisters of the Divine Compassion in December 2015. The<em> Journal News</em> has previously reported the sale price for the campus was $16.2 million. The property at one time housed Our Lady of Good Counsel High School, which was closed, and Good Counsel Grammar School, which relocated to Valhalla in mid-2015. A portion of the campus was sold to Pace University in 1975, which is now home to the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University and formerly housed The College of White Plains of Pace University and Good Counsel College.</p>
<p>The most recent alternative plan was presented by the developer in January 2020. Geoffrey Thompson, a spokesman for the property owner, said the White Plains Common Council’s actions on March 1 concludes the review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act, establishes a Planned Residential Development Zoning District for the site allowing for the mixed residential uses and approved a Master Plan setting forth the conceptual development program for the property. Remaining actions by the city include a site plan review and a review by the Historic Preservation Commission. The State Office of Historic Preservation has already given its approval to the redevelopment plan, he noted.</p>
<p>The plan now calls for 232 one-, two- and three-bedroom senior-restricted independent living apartments in a six-story building with a parking garage at the east end of the site, linked to a five-story building with a 103-unit assisted living and memory care facility. According to the project’s website, the community will be owned and operated by an unnamed nationally-renowned care provider for 35 years with approximately 300 communities in operation.</p>
<div id="attachment_35631" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sisters-of-Divine-Compassion-exterior-e1450811536211-1024x711.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35631" class="wp-image-35631" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sisters-of-Divine-Compassion-exterior-e1450811536211-1024x711.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="260" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-35631" class="wp-caption-text">The plan calls for the preservation of the Chapel of the Sisters of Divine Compassion at the former Our Lady of Good Counsel property at 52 North Broadway in White Plains.</p></div>
<p>The project will also feature 28 two-story, three-bedroom rental townhouses on the north and south sides of the site and 48 multifamily apartments in a three-story building to be constructed as part of the preservation of the west façade of the former convent. More than 90% of those units will be studio and one-bedroom apartment units. It should be noted that the approved plan includes maintaining the Chapel of the Sisters of Divine Compassion for ongoing use, preserving the historic Mapleton House at its present location and preserving the west wing of the former Convent that faces North Broadway, while adaptively incorporating it as part of the new development.</p>
<p>The latest plan significantly reduces the number of planned residential units, parking spaces and maximum heights of the buildings to be developed, but expands the senior housing component of the original plan. In addition, 95 units of student housing for the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University have been scrapped. The original plan put a maximum building height of 10 stories. The latest proposal has the maximum height of six stories or 85 feet, with a height of 50 feet or lower for the first 700 feet from North Broadway.</p>
<p>The plan reduces the number of parking spaces to 450 from 655 in an earlier proposal, and projected vehicle trips in and out of the site at peak times will be reduced by up to 43%, according to the property owner. There will be no access from Ross Street except for emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>The developer also touts the amount of green space that would remain as part of its plan. The current proposal provides for public access to the 2.3-acre front lawn of the campus facing North Broadway that maintains the street view of the property. The entire campus will also have extensive new landscaping.</p>
<p>While Thompson said that the remaining approvals could be secured in the next few weeks or several months, he did not divulge when a shovel will turn the first dirt on the venture and when the development will be completed and accepting its first residents. No estimated development cost for the project was released.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>YONKERS—A group led by business and labor organizations in Westchester and the Bronx have formed an alliance called “A Sure Bet for New York’s Future” in support of a full gaming license and access to mobile sports betting for Empire City Casino in Yonkers by MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>A full-scale casino license, complete with retail and mobile sports betting and live table games, will create thousands of new, family-sustaining union jobs, while generating millions in additional annual wages and tax revenue that would directly benefit local communities, the alliance stated. A spokesman for Empire City Casino told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that if awarded a full gaming license and sports betting access, MGM Resorts has committed to spend approximately $400 million in the first phase of its planned investment at the Yonkers property.</p>
<p>The initiative is being spearheaded by co-chairs: The Business Council of Westchester, the Bronx Chamber of Commerce and the Westchester Putnam Central Labor Body.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his State of the State message earlier this year said he intends to issue a Request for Information for interested parties in securing up to three of the remaining casino gaming licenses in Downstate New York (New York City metro region) to be granted by New York State.</p>
<p>While further details were not released, the New York State Gaming Commission noted that the proposal, if part of the state budget, would have to be approved by the State Legislature by the end of the fiscal year (March 31, 2021).</p>
<p>The addition of up to three casino gaming facilities in the New York City metro region that might include: Empire City Casino in Yonkers, Resorts World New York at Aqueduct Raceway in Queens—both operating as Video Lottery Terminal (VLT) facilities—and perhaps at the new Belmont complex in Nassau County or at a site to be developed in Manhattan. If the downstate initiative does move forward, the state would be beginning the process early, since the state’s gaming law bans the award of downstate casino licenses until 2023.</p>
<p>The “A Sure Bet for New York’s Future” alliance is focused on ensuring that the region is not left behind as the state considers implementing mobile sports betting.</p>
<p>“A full-scale casino license for Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts in Yonkers is a no brainer,” said John Ravitz, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Business Council of Westchester. “The brick and mortar are already in place. A full-scale casino license will enhance the existing facility and is a clear path to providing significantly more revenue for the state, offering union jobs, and supporting the entire region. And if New York is going to legalize mobile sports betting, MGM Resorts must be able to compete for a license. BetMGM is one of the top mobile sports betting platforms in the country, and New York needs and deserves the best operators.”</p>
<p>“There is overwhelming support among Bronx residents, community leaders, and businesses for Empire City to become a full-scale casino because we already have benefitted from Empire City’s presence,” said Lisa Sorin, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce. “A full-scale casino license for Empire City will no doubt have a direct impact on the Bronx. We urge the Governor and the Legislature to allow Empire City to develop into a full-scale casino so we can start to see the jobs and the revenue our state needs this fiscal year.” Sorin said that the expected investment by Empire City would provide sorely needed jobs for the Bronx, which is currently suffering from an unemployment rate of approximately 15%.</p>
<p>“A full-scale casino license at Empire City will support the creation of thousands of new union jobs from the more than $1 billion impact it will have on the region,” said Thomas Carey, president of the Westchester-Putnam Central Labor Body. “Think of all of the union jobs this will create for business and our Building and Construction Trades brothers and sisters as well as food service employees, security, and the endless opportunities as we advance. If Albany wants to prioritize economic recovery, they must allow Empire City to apply for a full-scale casino license as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The Alliance co-chairs sent a letter to Gov. Cuomo, Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and Assembly Speaker James Heastie, asking that a defined process be put in place to allow Empire City Casino to be able to pursue a full-scale commercial casino license so that the state can immediately benefit from this turnkey private economic development project.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to see such strong support across Westchester and the Bronx for the future of Empire City Casino,” said a spokesperson for Empire City Casino. “Before the pandemic, Empire City Casino was proud to be the largest private employer in Yonkers and we can play a pivotal role in New York’s recovery by bringing back well-paying jobs, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in capital development, and generating hundreds of millions of immediate revenue dollars through full-scale casino and mobile sports betting license fees.”</p>
<p>The spokesman added, “We remain committed to hiring and investing locally. Many of Empire City Casino’s employees are from Yonkers, the Bronx, Mount Vernon and across lower Westchester. MGM Resorts is a demonstrated leader in supporting local Minority, Women, and Veteran owned businesses in the regions in which we operate and we are committed to replicating that focus in New York.”</p>
<p>The planned $400-million first phase would include an enclosed and attached parking garage to shield patrons from inclement weather. Estimates on the development of the parking garage have run to as high as $160 million. Also planned would be renovations of the existing facility and the development of a sports bar in connection with the sports betting operaitons, the Empire City spokesperson noted.</p>
<p>On Jan. 29, 2019 MGM Resorts International acquired Empire City Casino and Yonkers Raceway for $850 million. The Rooney family acquired the storied Yonkers Raceway property in 1972 and opened the highly successful Empire City Casino in October 2006.</p>
<p>The alliance, which launched with nearly 30 members, is actively seeking additional members. Other alliance members to-date include:</p>
<p>• 100 Hispanic Women of Westchester<br />

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—The Orange County Legislature, frustrated over attempts to secure financial documents from the Orange County Industrial Development Agency, voted to remove the entire seven-member IDA Board of Directors on Thursday evening after a two-hour-long executive session.</p>
<p>Orange County legislators cited what they termed had been the lack of transparency by the Orange County Industrial Development Agency for its decision to remove the seven directors of the IDA and the Orange County Funding Corp. The New Windsor-based Industrial Development Agency is under a cloud of suspicion. The IDA’s operations are currently the subject of a probe by the Orange County District Attorney’s Office, in partnership with the New York State Comptroller’s Office and the New Windsor Police Department.</p>
<p>In an 18-0 vote with two abstentions, including one abstention by County Legislature Chairman Stephen Brescia (who served as one of the seven Directors replaced), the County Board removed the IDA Board consisting of Mary Ellen Rogulski, Chairman; Edward A. Diana, Vice Chair; James DiSalvo, Second Vice Chair; Brescia, Secretary; Michael Gaydos, Assistant Secretary; John I. McCarey and Denise Quinn.</p>
<p>The new IDA Board, whose term expires on Dec. 31, 2021, is: Chairman Dan Bloomer, Director of Operations for Orange County; Mike Torelli, Business Development Director, New York Stewart International Airport; County Legislator Paul Ruszkiewicz; John Douthit, President, Burke Catholic High School; Town of Woodbury Board Member Tyler Etzel; Leslie Pierri, retired New York City Police Dept.; and Orange County Community College Professor Vincent Odock.</p>
<p>The Orange County IDA is headed by Chief Executive Officer Laurie Villasuso and Managing Director Vincent Cozzolino.</p>
<p>County Legislator Ruszkiewicz, who heads the Education and Economic Development Committee and County Legislator James O’Donnell said that the legislature took the action because there is currently “no communication” taking place between the legislature and the Orange County IDA Board. They explained that the County Legislature has oversight over the IDA Board, while the IDA Board has oversight over the agency’s staff.</p>
<p>The County Legislature for months has been attempting to secure financial information concerning the IDA’s finances. In February, the IDA hired an independent auditor, who met with members of the Education and Economic Development Committee, but did not supply documents connected with the presentation. After promising to meet soon thereafter with the information, the committee was subsequently notified that neither the auditor or the IDA attorneys would appear at the meeting. The <em>Middletown Times Herald Record</em> reported recently that the IDA has retained as outside counsel the law firm Hinckley Allen, which has offices in New York City and Albany.</p>
<p>Both Ruszkiewicz and O’Donnell said the lack of transparency prompted the Legislature to replace the IDA Board. Both men stated that when the results of the investigations being conducted by the Orange County District Attorney and the State Comptroller are concluded, some or all IDA Board members that were replaced, could be reappointed to serve on the IDA Board in the future.</p>
<p>Ruszkiewicz said that with the number of development projects in the pipeline in Orange County, it is critical that the County Legislature be informed on IDA operations.</p>
<p>The Orange County IDA released a statement on the legislature’s actions, stating: “Over the past decade, the IDA has achieved significant successes in job creation and revenue generation for Orange County. The current board is proud to have fulfilled its duties and obligations to benefit local taxpayers and businesses alike.”</p>
<p>The new IDA Board had to file paperwork with the state and recent sat for the first time.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus, State Senator James Skoufis, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Investigations Committee, and State Senator Michael Martucci released a joint statement concerning the legislature’s action concerning the Orange County IDA. “The Orange County IDA needs to explain themselves to taxpayers. Shutting down and lawyering up because of a pending investigation tells us there is a big problem,” they stated. “We applaud the Orange County District Attorney for launching an investigation and, if anyone at the IDA is found to have acted inappropriately, taxpayers must be made whole financially.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h4>A Give-Back Journey</h4>
<p>At this point in her life, Jeanne Shields is taking a little breather from her many, many philanthropic activities, including serving as a Trustee and fundraising volunteer for the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation. The Associate Broker with Howard Hanna | Rand Realty’s Nyack office has a very good reason for her much-needed rest—over the summer, she donated a kidney to her daughter Lauren, who will turn 21 next month.</p>
<p>The surgery was a life-changing event for both, especially given Lauren’s history of a life-threatening illness. When she was just eight years old, Lauren developed viral myocarditis, a rare heart disease. Shortly after her diagnosis, she went into heart failure where her heart was working at only 14%.</p>
<p>She spent the next nine months at Columbia Presbyterian, Morgan Stanley Children&#8217;s Hospital while waiting for a new heart. When her condition declined even further, Shields contacted Make-A-Wish Hudson Valley. Fortunately, Lauren was able to receive a new heart, but later suffered a stroke while recovering at the hospital.</p>
<p>After she was eventually sent home, Lauren spent most of her time in her bedroom recovering. Her “wish” for a bedroom makeover, complete with new furnishings, a TV and clothes, was granted. In 2014, Lauren was the featured speaker at HGAR’s “Make-A-Wish” gala held at the Clubhouse at Patriot Hills in Stony Point.</p>
<p>Shields explained that Lauren’s kidney failure was a result of the many medications she is taking for her heart. While the meds have since changed, they require constant monitoring. Both mother and daughter returned to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for the kidney transplant, which was a huge success. “We’re ‘frequent flyers’ there,” Shields quipped. “I think I just need some time to get strong again and I’ll be back to all of my advocacy and fundraising work. It’s such a big part of my life.”</p>
<p>Adhering to the “family first” motto, Shields said she is so grateful to her Realtor family during the time before and after the surgery. “The Rands and the agents were so incredibly supportive and helpful,” she acknowledged. “They were constantly reaching out to make sure we were OK and they even sent food for us to the hospital. I never had the feeling of pressure from work.”</p>
<div id="attachment_35678" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lauren-and-jeanne-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35678" class="wp-image-35678" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lauren-and-jeanne-2.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-35678" class="wp-caption-text">From left, Lauren and her mother Jeanne Shields after the kidney transplant operation at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.</p></div>
<p>It was shortly after the “Make-A-Wish” gala that Shields got involved with the HG Realtor Foundation. “I wanted to do more at a local level with the board and with my peers,” she recalled. “I was also very impressed with Bonnie Koff and her contributions, so I wanted to step in and work with her and the committee. (Koff still chairs the HG Realtor Foundation Fundraising Committee.)</p>
<p>Later, Shields became a Trustee of the foundation, while continuing to help with fundraising and attending events. “I was the point person for a couple of Rockland events and it was so much fun,” she said. “I met some great people who I never would have had the opportunity to know had I not been involved. I miss the live events but I’m looking forward to us all being able to come together again.”</p>
<p>Shields remains involved with LiveOnNY, a non-profit advocating for organ and tissue donation, as well as the New York Alliance for Donation. She was personally invited to lobby on behalf of NYAD in Albany to allow young adults, with parental consent, to enroll in an organ donor registry at age 16.</p>
<p>She and her daughter Lauren also actively campaigned for organ donor programs and helped to enact “Lauren’s Law,” which makes it mandatory for New Yorkers to answer the question about organ donations on their driver’s license. In the past, drivers could ignore the question. Since that time, Michigan has also adopted a similar law. “It’s made such a huge difference in the number of organ donations,” added Shields.</p>
<p>In the past, Shields has also been a volunteer with the New York Blood Center, the American Heart Association, the Helen Hayes Foundation and many others.</p>
<p>Although she does love her philanthropic work, Shields assures she is just as dedicated to her life as a Realtor and manager. She has worked with Howard Hanna | Rand Realty for the past four years, and before that she served as a salesperson  with Prominent Properties Sotheby’s International Realty, a productivity coach with Keller Williams Realty and branch manager with Weichert Realtors.</p>
<p>Shields actually started her real estate career as a salesperson with Weichert back in 2000, while seeking part-time work when her children were young. “It seemed like a good idea to me, and I guess it has been,” she admitted. Today, she manages 41 agents, striving to be available to them whenever they need.</p>
<p>Prior to real estate, she designed jewelry for trunk shows and sold to some local boutiques. When Shields eventually sold her business, she had five sales representatives working with her. The business, Tokens of Love, featured necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings and pins with semi-precious stones and antique features. “I had no formal training for that, but I just enjoyed being creative,” she added.</p>
<p>Shields holds a degree in Business Administration from Iona College in New Rochelle and her daughter Lauren is now attending Dominican College in Orangeburg, studying life sciences. Her son Brandon, 26, is a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps and is learning to be a pilot.</p>
<p>In the little spare time that she has in her breaks from real estate and volunteering, Shields likes to stay fit with boxing workouts. “It’s a great stress relief and probably the best workout out there,” she said. The Stony Point resident also loves doing outdoor activities like hiking and going to the beach.</p>
<p>“I do look forward to getting back to my volunteer and fundraising work,” she said. “It’s all part of my give-back journey. I want to say ‘thank you’ to the universe for giving me my daughter back.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The following forms are required to be provided, posted, or executed. Failure to do so can expose the agent and the brokerage to discipline, fines, and possible loss of licensure.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over the past few years we’ve seen a tremendous increase in the use of forms. Where we once had only one or two forms to fill out (usually done on the hood of a car), we now have up to a dozen documents. So, for the purposes of guidance and clarity, I’m going to try to break things down for everyone in this month’s article.</p>
<p><strong>Required Forms</strong></p>
<p>The following forms are required to be provided, posted, or executed. Failure to do so can expose the agent and the brokerage to discipline, fines, and possible loss of licensure.</p>
<p><strong>Agency Disclosure Form (443 Disclosure)</strong>: This form is required by the Department of State Licensing and explains to the client/customer where the agent’s fiduciary duties lie. It’s required to be provided at “first substantive contact,” meaning that you must give it to the client/customer when you first engage is any substantial way with them. This contact could be in person, over the phone, via e-mail, or even social media. If the disclosure is for a homeowner listing a property, it should be provided prior to signing up the listing. If it is with a buyer (either customer or client), it should be provided when they first engage in any meaningful conversation about the purchase of a property. It can be provided physically or electronically. This form can be found on the HGAR website at: NY State Agency Disclosure Form &#8211; Buyer/Seller.pdf (<a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2018/07/NY-State-Agency-Disclosure-Form-BuyerSeller.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hgar.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Housing and Anti-Discrimination Disclosure Form</strong>: Since June 2020, this form is also required to be provided to all consumers. It applies to all property types. Similar to the 443 Disclosure form, it too must be provided at “first substantive contact” and it must be retained for a period of at least three years. A copy of the disclosure is located on the New York State Department of State website at: Microsoft Word &#8211; 2156_new.docx (<a href="https://www.ny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ny.gov</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Housing and Anti-Discrimination Notice</strong>: Unlike the disclosure form, this is a notice that must be prominently displayed in each office and branch office of a brokerage, as well as at every open house (additional copies are to be supplied at open houses upon request). Additionally, a link to the notice must be “prominently and conspicuously” displayed on all websites managed by the brokerage, including all agent websites and social media pages. A copy of the notice is located on the New York State Department of State website at: FairHousingSinglePage.pdf (<a href="https://www.ny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ny.gov</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Notice Disclosing Tenant’s Rights to Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities</strong>: NYS Executive Law 296 (2-b) &amp; (18-a) went into effect last week on March 2, 2021. It requires every housing provider covered under the law to provide a written disclosure to all tenants and prospective tenants within 30 days of the beginning of their tenancy, or 30 days from the effective date of the law for current tenants. This notice is not required to be provided at “first substantive contact,” but only after a lease is signed. Additionally, it requires that a copy of the notice be “conspicuously posted in such form and manner as the division may by regulation prescribe on every vacant housing accommodation that is available to rent.” While the Division of Human Rights has not provided any regulations relating to this posting, agents for landlords and property managers should make sure their clients are posting the notice in all available rental units. NYSAR is seeking clarification on this matter and will be providing updates as more information becomes available.</p>
<p>On March 5, 2021, the DHR published sample language that can be used to satisfy these new requirements. That information can be found on the DHR website at: Required Notice for Required Notice for Housing Providers | New York State Division of Human Rights (<a href="https://www.ny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ny.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Lead Disclosure</strong>: Federal law requires that a buyer or tenant that purchases or rents a residential property built prior to 1978 must be provided a lead disclosure form prepared and executed by the homeowner or landlord as well as a copy of the lead disclosure booklet.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusive Listing Agreement</strong>: While this may seem obvious, you would be surprised how many agents do not obtain a fully executed listing agreement. Without all the necessary parties signing and dating this agreement, it may be considered invalid. Usually, this means that all the parties on the deed must sign it and the broker/manager of the brokerage must sign the agreement as well. The agent cannot sign for the brokerage. Without a valid listing agreement, the listing cannot go on the MLS.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Forms</strong></p>
<p>Concerning optional forms, it is important for agents to discuss the pros and cons of these forms with the client. While they may provide a level of security for the client, demanding execution of these forms may also have the unintended effect of delaying showings, reducing showings and prolonging the transaction’s time. Failure to have these discussions may be deemed a Code of Ethics violation.</p>
<p><strong>COVID Disclosure Forms:</strong> NYSAR has provided a sample form that can be co-branded. It is not required by law. Use of this form is not for the agent/brokerage to determine (although a brokerage may refuse to list a property where the homeowner refuses to utilize it), it’s for the client to decide. If, after discussion with the client, they decide to utilize it, the execution of this form may be a prerequisite for a showing. If it is implemented, it must be required by everyone; otherwise, the client (and brokerage) may expose themselves to a discrimination lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>COVID Questionnaire</strong>: Similar to the above-referenced form, this questionnaire may also be required as a prerequisite to showing a property. Again, this determination is by the client, not the agent/brokerage and it must be applied uniformly to all parties.</p>
<p><strong>Hold Harmless Agreements</strong>: NYSAR has not provided or endorsed such forms, but again, they may be utilized as a prerequisite for showing a property.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-qualification or Proof of Funds</strong>: This requirement is not new. Proof of funds or a basic pre-qualification letter from a bank is relatively common. Again, this requirement should be discussed with the homeowner.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As agents we are constantly inundated with forms. Obtaining a listing, finding a motivated buyer, or locating that special home is hard enough, never mind obtaining all the required signatures on forms. Further, when you add in all the additional forms and the forms that you may be required to fill out by your brokerage, it becomes an exhausting process. Nevertheless, they are necessary. They protect you, your brokerage and especially your client. Sadly, there isn’t one unified form for everything, and parties can choose to use or not use forms. For optional forms, standardized forms are available, but that doesn’t mean that parties can’t create their own forms; and there is no singular clearinghouse for obtaining these forms to create “one stop shopping.” Maybe this will happen in the future, but at the present time we must be detail-oriented, efficient, and patient and follow up on getting that “John Hancock” on all your forms.</p>
<p>As a final thought, an issue has arisen and is being discussed as to whether forms could be utilized as a tool to discriminate against protected classes. In filling out these forms are parties providing insight into their backgrounds? Can information be gleaned where names provide race/national origin/religious clues, or where questions reveal age, gender, familial status or sexual orientation? It’ll be interesting to see how the use of forms continues and what changes the future holds for us.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The following occurrences all highlight the importance of real estate licensees having a working knowledge of antitrust laws and dangers associated with any violation of antitrust laws: the recent antitrust lawsuits in the real estate industry, the focus on large technology and social media companies by Congressional leaders, the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit and settlement with the National Association of Realtors (see <a href="https://bit.ly/38o41Iy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/38o41Iy</a>), and large real estate firms like Zillow becoming licensed brokers and members of multiple listing services.</p>
<p>Brian Levine, Esq., In-House Counsel and Director of Legal Services and Professional Standards for HGAR, highlighted in a recent article (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3t5E4W9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3t5E4W9</a>) the dangers of agents engaging in behavior that could be deemed a violation of federal and state antitrust laws especially where a new player, namely Zillow, has entered the real estate field. On March 9, 2021, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court Western District of Washington in Seattle, by Rex – Real Estate Exchange, Inc. against Zillow, its affiliated entities, Trulia and NAR for antitrust violations (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3qy7vyx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3qy7vyx</a>).</p>
<p>A recent federal court decision in<em> The PLS.com v. The National Association of Realtors, et al</em>. (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3t3hbmj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3t3hbmj</a>) provides a helpful explanation and analysis of the federal antitrust laws. In <em>PLS</em>, the federal district court judge dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by The PLS.com against NAR because the plaintiff could not meet the elements needed to establish that NAR and the other defendants engaged in antitrust behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Federal Antitrust Law</strong></p>
<p>In 1890, Congress passed the first antitrust law, which is known as the Sherman Act. The Federal Trade Commission explains the Sherman Act is a “…comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade” (see (<a href="https://bit.ly/38q0BF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/38q0BF4</a>). In 1914, Congress then passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, which created the FTC, and the Clayton Act. These three laws are still in effect today and are the main antitrust laws in the nation. States also have their own versions of the antitrust laws that are similar to the federal laws. The FTC states that “…for over 100 years, the antitrust laws have had the same basic objective: to protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers, making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently, keep prices down, and keep quality up.” The courts will apply the laws and determine what constitutes illegal anticompetitive and antitrust behavior.</p>
<p><strong>The Sherman Act</strong></p>
<p>Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that “every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.” Early on this provision was fairly broad and could encompass most behavior engaged in by businesses or individuals. The FTC further explains that the Sherman Act also makes illegal, behavior that amounts to “…monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize.”</p>
<p>In <em>PLS</em>, the judge explains that “restraints can be unreasonable for antitrust purposes in one of two ways. Some restraints are unreasonable per se because they ‘always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output.’ If the challenged restraint is not unreasonable per se, then the restraint is judged under the Rule of Reason.” The court points out that most antitrust claims are analyzed under the “Rule of Reason” standard.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Rule of Reason’</strong></p>
<p>The Sherman Act does not prohibit every restraint of trade, only those that are unreasonable. In 1918, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis enunciated the “Rule of Reason,” which provided clarification as to what constituted illegal antitrust behavior:</p>
<p>“The true test of illegality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts before and after the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be obtained are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.”</p>
<p>The court in PLS, explains that the goal of “the Rule of Reason analysis is to ‘distinguish between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer’s best interest.’” In order for a plaintiff to establish that a defendant engaged in violative antitrust behavior, a plaintiff must establish existence of the following:</p>
<p>“(1) a contract, combination or conspiracy among two or more persons or distinct business entities;</p>
<p>(2) by which the persons or entities intended to harm or restrain trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations;</p>
<p>(3) which actually injures competition; [and]</p>
<p>(4) that [the plaintiff] was harmed by the unlawful anti-competitive restraint and that such harm flowed from an ‘anti-competitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny.’”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has explained that “the purpose of the (Sherman) Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market.” Therefore, it is important to understand that not all behavior that may restrain competition is violative of the antitrust laws.</p>
<p><strong>‘Per Se’ Violations</strong></p>
<p>While not all behavior that may be anticompetitive is illegal, there is behavior that is recognized to be a “per se” violation of the antitrust laws. The Supreme Court over the years developed certain guidelines and indicated that certain forms of eliminating competition are unreasonable “per se” or “on its face.” Some actions that are considered to be “per se” illegal include price fixing, group boycotts, market or customer allocations and tying agreements. Any agreement to fix or suggest commission rates for example, constitutes a violation of the Sherman Act. Any group of two or more brokers who agree that they will not do business with another broker or particular enterprise, would constitute a group boycott. Agreements that restrict the right of competitors to enter a particular territory are also “per se” illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Price or Commission Fixing</strong></p>
<p>NAR explains that “the antitrust prohibition on fixing commission rates means, simply, two or more real estate firms may not agree on the commission rate that each will charge.” Additionally, NAR points out that “brokers must not agree with others on commission rates, and must take care to avoid even implying that they have discussed and/or reached agreement on fees. Salespeople must exercise similar caution to avoid the implication that the firm with which they are affiliated is part of a price-fixing conspiracy.”</p>
<p><strong>Bid-Rigging</strong></p>
<p>Bid rigging is yet another “per se” violation of the antitrust laws. An example of bid rigging “…is when competitors agree in advance which firm will win the bid. For instance, competitors may agree to take turns being the low bidder, or sit out of a bidding round, or provide unacceptable bids to cover up a bid-rigging scheme. Other bid-rigging agreements involve subcontracting part of the main contract to the losing bidders or forming a joint venture to submit a single bid.” (See <a href="https://bit.ly/3bwCvur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3bwCvur</a>). An example of bid rigging in the real estate context, is where a property may be sold at auction in connection with a foreclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Fixing Commission Splits is Illegal</strong></p>
<p>Another illegal antitrust behavior, which also involves a form of price fixing, is agreeing on a commission split. NAR points out that “…listing brokers may not agree on the commission ‘split’ to be paid to compensate cooperating brokers who produce a ready, willing and able buyer for a listed property. Conspiracies among competitors to fix the compensation paid to cooperating brokers may also be deemed per se illegal.” NAR explains that “…brokers must determine their cooperative compensation policies in the same unilateral and independent manner that they establish the commission or fees charged to clients.” (See<a href="https://bit.ly/3qxltAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/3qxltAA</a>).</p>
<p>It is permissible, however, for listing brokers and selling brokers to discuss the commission they will pay to each other in connection with each individual transaction, which should take place in advance of an offer.</p>
<p><strong>Group Boycotts</strong></p>
<p>Group boycotting is usually considered a “per se” violation of the antitrust laws. In certain instances, group boycotts may also be analyzed under the “Rule of Reason” standard. As pointed out by NAR, “a group boycott is a concerted refusal to deal with a particular party, such as when two or more businesses agree to refuse to deal with another competitor in order to force a change in a competitor’s behavior or to attempt to drive the competitor out of business.” Often the target of the alleged boycott is a broker that employs a ‘discount,’ ‘alternative,’ or other non-traditional commission/compensation arrangement with clients.” The group boycott’s primary effect is to eliminate a competitor in the market.</p>
<p><strong>NAR: Agreements as to Other Terms are Illegal</strong></p>
<p>NAR further points out that the “…agreements among competitors regarding other terms or conditions of a listing agreement, such as the length of the listing, the type of listing accepted, or the marketing services to be provided by the listing broker, although such agreements may not be treated as “per se” violations but may be illegal. Any express or “understood” agreements as to the terms and conditions of listing agreements or other broker-client agreements raise serious antitrust concerns. The lawfulness of such agreements will in many cases be analyzed under the Rule of Reason, which balances the pro-competitive effects of the agreement, if any, against the anti-competitive consequences.</p>
<p><strong>The DOJ and FTC: The Focus on the Real Estate Industry</strong></p>
<p>The FTC and DOJ are clearly focusing their attention on the real estate industry. According to the FTC, “real estate professionals are changing the way they do business: offering potential buyers the chance to view detailed property listings online, using websites to gather leads on potential customers and using the Internet to match buyers and sellers.” As a result, the FTC is enforcing the “…antitrust rules in the real estate business to make sure that increased competition continues to lead to more choices, better prices and stepped-up services for buyers and sellers. For instance, the commission challenged a number of restrictive rules adopted by Multiple Listing Services to keep low-cost and discount brokers off MLS listings and popular websites listing homes for sale.” (See <a href="https://bit.ly/3bvqncZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3bvqncZ</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Severe Penalties for Antitrust Violations</strong></p>
<p>Brokers and agents must be aware that the penalties for violating the Sherman Act can be severe. The FTC points out that “although most enforcement actions are civil, the Sherman Act is also a criminal law, and individuals and businesses may be prosecuted by the Department of Justice.” In connection with a civil antitrust action a defendant could face treble damages and legal fees incurred by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In connection with a criminal prosecution, the FTC explains that individuals or companies will be convicted usually when there is intentional and clear wrongdoing such as engaging in price fixing or bid-rigging. Those prosecuted under the Sherman Act could face “…criminal penalties of up to $100 million for a corporation and $1 million for an individual, along with up to 10 years in prison. Under federal law, the maximum fine may be increased to twice the amount the conspirators gained from the illegal acts or twice the money lost by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is over $100 million.” (See <a href="https://bit.ly/3v3EVZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3v3EVZc</a>).</p>

    <description><![CDATA[With the advent of COVID vaccines and mass distribution now underway, the 1.4 million NAR members and the nation are beginning to adjust to what will likely be the “new normal” in how people live their daily lives and how they conduct business in a post COVID-19 environment.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Charlie Oppler took over as president of the National Association of Realtors at a pivotal time for the national organization and for the nation’s real estate industry as well.</p>
<p>With the advent of COVID vaccines and mass distribution now underway, the 1.4 million NAR members and the nation are beginning to adjust to what will likely be the “new normal” in how people live their daily lives and how they conduct business in a post COVID-19 environment.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old veteran Realtor who is CEO of Prominent Properties Sotheby’s International Realty in Franklin Lakes, NJ, made headlines shortly after his installation last November as 2021 NAR President when he offered an apology on behalf of NAR for its past practices that he said contributed to segregation and racial inequality in America.</p>
<p>“What Realtors did was an outrage to our morals and our ideals. It was a betrayal of our commitment to fairness and equality. I’m here today, as the president of the National Association of Realtors, to say that we were wrong,” Oppler said. “We can’t go back to fix the mistakes of the past, but we can look at this problem squarely in the eye. And, on behalf of our industry, we can say that what Realtors did was shameful, and we are sorry.”</p>
<p>NAR initially opposed passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968, and at one time allowed the exclusion of members based on race or sex. “Because of our past mistakes, the real estate industry has a special role to play in the fight for fair housing,” said Oppler.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> recently talked with the affable NAR President to lean his views on key matters, particularly due to the fair housing issues New York Realtors are facing at the moment, and the plethora of other pressing matters that will impact the industry in the coming months and years as the nation looks to inoculate the nation and the economy against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed well in excess of half a million people nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> A repeal of the SALT deduction has been introduced in Congress recently. Will NAR fight to reinstate the full SALT deduction?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DNp93dzX0AAkNj8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-35831" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DNp93dzX0AAkNj8.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a>Oppler:</strong> The $10,000 cap for state and local taxes became really a point of contention between the parties and it is even more a source of contention now that the Democrats are in higher-taxed states. The problem is that with the new (Biden) administration, you have Democrats in higher and lower-taxed states and you have a little bit of conflict within their own party. The key to it for me is that the current tax code penalizes families who file taxes on a joint return. With the new SALT deduction, you are limited regardless of how you file so in essence you are penalizing the family formation. So, ultimately if we decide to support the fight on Capitol Hill to secure the full federal income tax deductibility of state and local payments, we are going to have to put special emphasis on finding a bipartisan solution because it is in fact so partisan right now. So, that is a big concern for us and we certainly recognize the difficulty of fully repealing it because of the lack of common ground on anything in D.C. right now as evidenced by the $1.9-trillion stimulus package that may come down to another vote by the Vice President (in the Senate). <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The interview with NAR President Oppler was held prior to the passage of the $1.9-trillion American Rescue Plan.</p>
<p>That is what we are up against. But, I think the first fix for us is the marriage penalty in the SALT Cap by allowing married couples to deduct up to $20,000 instead of the $10,000. That would be the first solution and we are pretty sure we can get overwhelming bipartisan support on that. Then, I guess the last part about SALT right now would be that if we looked for the maximum cap to (be changed to) $20,000 for joint returns and indexing, that might be the solution because of the fact that there are so many properties that have high property taxes. If we can eliminate the marriage penalty it doubles the maximum penalty up to $20,000 for joint filers and we can do some kind of indexing the cap for inflation, then that might be a short-term and bipartisan solution.</p>
<p>If I look at the big picture, you try to get the best outcome for short-term and long term, because if we can get some kind of adjustment, you don’t want it to be back on the table in two years when (or if) there is a change (in leadership in Congress)… If we push for the full repeal, it becomes a negotiation anyway, so we are going to look to do something that we think we can have some success with.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> There have been proposed changes to the independent contracting status regulations. What is your position on those changes going forward and have you held discussions with the Biden administration on their impacts to Realtors?</p>
<p><strong>Oppler:</strong> I know our lobbyists and our staff in Washington, D.C. are always concerned about independent contractors. Real estate sales agents have a statutory provision in the I.R.S. Code (Section# 3508) and this has been in place since 1984. So, we obviously 100% oppose any erosion of the provision in the Tax Code or anything that has to do with not being classified as independent contractors. We understand that every business has changed, but for us this is a big one and really what is important that the Department of Labor has a change in its rule that goes into effect March 8, 2021, which gives more clarity on how an employer can classify his or her worker, but obviously we don’t think it has any impact on us.</p>
<p>Now, part of the problem here is that you also have a number of states statutes that follow the policy set by the federal government as far as how we are classified as independent contractors, but then you get into issues about workmen’s comp and other statutes when you are starting to qualify licensed real estate as independent contractors. In other words, we are just making sure that any action taken by the Department of Labor would avoid any changes to our classification as an independent contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> NAR President Opler noted that NAR was very involved in securing protection for independent contractors, commission workers to get the $600 federal unemployment stipend. He stressed that NAR believes sales agents are independent contractors and NAR will fight to ensure that there will be no change to that classification.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The President recently extended the foreclosure moratorium and mortgage forbearance through June 30. Will NAR push for mortgage debt forgiveness, assistance for residential and commercial landlords impacted by those moratoriums and/or other aid proposals geared at bolstering the housing market in response to the pandemic?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Presidents-Circle_0030.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-35829" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Presidents-Circle_0030.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a>Oppler:</strong> We were pleased to see the administration continue to protect housing for those that are vulnerable because I think nobody thought the pandemic would go this long and it certainly has been disruptive for so many people. Not only does it (moratoriums) provide security for those at-risk of foreclosure, but also provides stability for us in the broader residential market. So, in other words, the last thing we need is to lose that forbearance and have people default and have an overwhelming amount of short sales or foreclosures. That doesn’t bode well for real values of properties. In the latest COVID relief bill, the exclusion from income from mortgage debt forgiveness is extended for five years. That is huge, but the maximum amount is reduced from $2 million to $750,000. So, there is an adjustment, but most mortgages in this country are $750,000 or less.</p>
<p>The most important part in that same legislation is the $25 billion in rental assistance for housing providers. Many of the owners of property are Mom and Pops. NAR research has shown that 38% of Realtors own at least one rental property and on top of that 40% of rental units nationally are owned by Mom and Pops. That is why the assistance has to go to the provider as well as for the protection for tenants. It can’t just be one way…</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> NAR President Oppler said that NAR will be looking to work with the Biden administration to increase the national homeownership rate. In terms of further COVID housing relief, the NAR President said the association would be supportive of more banks offering FHA financing. “It is our view that we need to make sure that the mortgage insurance premiums for loans over 90%, which have penalized home buyers for not being able to put down the larger down payment, has to be eradicated,” he said. “That hurts so many buyers coming into the market.”</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Will NAR support the government&#8217;s role in the GSE debate?</p>
<p><strong>Oppler:</strong> I don’t know that support is the right word. In 2019 we formally proposed a utility model for Fannie and Freddie. Our overall perspective is that if the pandemic had gotten worse and if the GSEs would not have been effective in protecting the real estate market, we would have been in bad, bad shape as a country. So, that certainly would have been super important at that point. Fannie and Freddie and the GSEs support over 80% of the residential market in the U.S. That is how essential they are to the success of our business and they still get special treatment from the government to meet the needs of the underserved markets to maintain liquidity at all times. For us, the utility proposal would ensure Fannie and Freddie continue to fulfill their charter mission to every customer. So fair housing becomes a big play there… You want to make sure that whatever you do with Fannie and Freddie that they can attract investors, minimize taxpayer reach, keep costs down and make mortgages affordable if they were to transition into a utilities market versus the conservatorship that is now held. The positive part right now is that because of the GSEs, a home buyer in Springfield, MO and a buyer in Springfield, MA, two completely different markets, have equal access to a mortgage and pay nearly the same rates. That becomes critical.</p>
<p>And the last and most major concern is that without the GSEs, if they did not exist, rates would be higher in normal times, access would decline because of credit and the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as we know it would not be widely available… So that is why in our view we support the utility model, which allows for private capital investment, but still protects taxpayers from a bailout as we were stuck with way back when.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Almost immediately upon taking office, you issued an apology for Realtors&#8217; past Fair Housing practices, calling them “an outrage to our morals and our ideals” and “a betrayal of our commitment to fairness and equality.” What reforms or initiatives are planned by NAR this year to further fair housing in the U.S.?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2101_Cover_432x565.png.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35832 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2101_Cover_432x565.png.jpeg" alt="" width="294" height="400" /></a>Oppler:</strong> The apology that I offered to me was a pretty simple decision. The old Chinese proverb: “When is the best time to plant a tree: 20 years ago. When is the next best time: now.” I looked at the history of NAR and the Fair Housing Act and our lack of support and knew that the homeownership rates in the African-American community being as low as they were that quite frankly the banking community and the real estate community were part and parcel of that problem. So, I think by acknowledging it and saying the association played (a role) in contributing to the segregation and racial inequality in America was important. I think it allowed a lot of us to move forward. Today, we have a President’s Challenge to our Leadership Team, Board of Directors, state and local leadership to become better educated in Fair Housing. They have taken a simulation called “Fairhaven,” a video on implicit bias, and we have over 1,000 members taking it and an “At Home with Diversity” designation course. So, we are committed to what we do better.</p>
<p>Some of the (fair housing-oriented) things we have done is visited HUD in 2020 to discuss things we could do better as an association and we spent the last year implementing what we call our fair housing initiative “ACT,” which stands for &#8220;Accountability Culture Change and Training.” We have also partnered with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the “Equality of Opportunity” initiative and we continue to work with them to make a broader national effort to look at why the economic inequality exists and how do we advance inclusion?</p>
<p>So, there is no way to go back in time to correct or rectify the mistakes we have made, but we can be the leaders going forward in trying to have our 1.4 million members help benefit everybody with the American Dream of homeownership. I think we can be the catalysts going forward…”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The pending bill, which now goes to committee for review, is a significant step in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ continuing efforts to promote fair housing and reform the cooperative home buying process in Westchester County.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A bill that would amend existing county law relating to the sale of cooperative housing to now require cooperative boards of directors to disclose the reason for denial of a prospective purchaser was officially introduced for consideration by the Westchester County Board of Legislators on Monday, March 22.</p>
<p>The pending bill, which now goes to committee for review, is a significant step in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ continuing efforts to promote fair housing and reform the cooperative home buying process in Westchester County.</p>
<p>The bill would amend Westchester County Local Law No. 11-2018, which now requires cooperative boards to acknowledge receipt of a purchaser’s application within 15 days and to either approve or reject such application within 60 days. The bill amendment, if passed, would require that upon notification, the cooperative governing board shall provide to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission notice of the rejection and the reason for the rejection of the purchaser’s application. The current law requires that rejections be forwarded to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission, but does not require the cooperative boards to provide a reason for the applicant’s rejection.</p>
<p>HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska said, “This is a crucial step for Westchester in supporting Fair Housing because ultimately that is the real issue here. This bill recognizes and seeks to correct a potential shield for discrimination that may be occurring by some bad actors.”</p>
<p>Syska, who is an associate broker with Keller Williams NY Realty, added, “At this moment, the public needs to be assured that their rights and freedom of choice are being protected by the leaders of our county and that they refuse to be complicit in any policy or procedure that could potentially harm our protected classes.”</p>
<p>Since the Westchester County co-op transparency law was enacted in late 2018 there have been approximately 500 known rejections of buyers seeking to purchase a home, according to Phil Weiden, government affairs director for HGAR.</p>
<p>The introduction of the amendment came after the New York State Association of Realtors issued a Call to Action earlier this month for the Westchester County Board of Legislators to pass co-op transparency legislation.</p>
<p>The “Call to Action” to Realtors was to send a message to Westchester County legislators and Westchester County Executive George Latimer urging their support for the Westchester County Legislature to pass a new law requiring co-op boards to provide a reason in writing for application denials.</p>
<p>“We strongly urge the legislature to enact an amendment to the law that requires a co-op board to provide a reason in writing stating their rationale for denying someone the ability to purchase or lease a home,” the Call to Action states. “Under the current law, no reason is given. The board is merely required to notify the applicant that they have been denied. This new provision would allow the applicant and the human rights commission to hold the board to account if the reason(s) given seems questionable.”</p>
<p>The amendment proposes penalties to cooperative boards for any requirements of the legislation. A fine of $1,000 would be levied for the first offense; a second offense would involve a $1,500 fine and the Human Rights Commission would levy a fine of $2,000 for a third or any subsequent offense. The bill now goes to the Housing and Labor Committee, along with the Committee on Legislation. It has to pass through those, and then would go on to the full Board of Legislators for debate.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty said of the introduction of the amendment to the co-op law, &#8220;Opponents of this common-sense co-op transparency legislation suggest that it&#8217;s a solution looking for a problem. With almost 500 co-op applicant rejections reported to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission in the last two years, I suggest that this proposed legislation is indeed the right solution for what is obviously a very big problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Veteran Realtor Leah Caro, president and principal broker of Park Sterling Realty in Bronxville, said, “At a time when civil rights, housing rights, and equality are at the fore-front of the collective conscience, it is altogether fitting and timely that the County Legislature take steps to strengthen the laws associated with transparency and anti-discrimination in co-op housing by having a reason for declinations to be given.”</p>
<p>She added, “The co-op boards that have always upheld fair housing law should welcome the change to the existing co-op transparency law; it should help eliminate the stigma that co-ops have been subject to by reluctant buyers. It’s a win for co-op owners, co-op sellers and co-op buyers.”</p>
<p>Barry Kramer, who has been a long-time advocate for co-op reform, said, “This legislation will provide added transparency to co-op transactions. Whereas the Board of Legislators passed legislation at the end of 2018 that added steps to ensure more disclosure to co-op sales, requiring a reason for declination was not included. With nearly 500 rejections in the past two years we see that there is still a need for buyers and sellers to understand why an application was not approved.” Kramer, who is the broker-owner of Westchester Choice Realty of Hartsdale, added, “Co-ops are an important part of the Westchester housing market and this legislation will make the process better for both buyers and sellers.”</p>
<p>The initial co-op transparency law was signed by Westchester County Executive George Latimer on Dec. 14, 2018 and was described as one of the biggest legislative victories in the history of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and its predecessor organizations. Westchester County joined Suffolk County, the Village of Hempstead, Rockland County and Nassau County in passing co-operative transparency legislation.</p>
<p>The 2018 bill was co-sponsored by Christopher A. Johnson (D-Yonkers) and Catherine Borgia, (D-Cortlandt, Croton on Hudson, Ossining, Briarcliff Manor, Peekskill) and Vice-Chairwoman of the Board Alfreda Williams.</p>
<p>The bill was the subject of negotiations between HGAR, the County Board of Legislators, and the Building and Realty Institute of Westchester &amp; the Mid-Hudson Region and affiliates. The BRI, which represents cooperative boards of directors, had objected to earlier drafts of the bill that included harsher requirements, including notification of the reason for a purchaser’s denial.</p>
<p>It should be noted that New York State Association of Realtors once again has passage of statewide co-op disclosure legislation as one of its top legislative priorities in the 2021 legislative session in Albany.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—New York federal representatives and Westchester County Executive George Latimer staged a press conference on March 25th at the home of a White Plains resident to push for the repeal of the controversial SALT (State and Local Tax) deduction cap.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones (NY-17), U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi (NY-03), U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), and Westchester County Executive George Latimer called for the repeal of SALT Cap ($10,000) to be included in the next package to come out of Washington, DC. The elected officials held a joint press conference outside the home of Ayeshah and Brian Parker who are negatively impacted by the SALT cap.</p>
<p>“Since the previous President capped the SALT deduction at $10,000 in 2017, hundreds of thousands of people in my district, where we pay the highest property taxes in the entire nation, have been forced to pay thousands of dollars more in taxes each year—a crushing burden for middle-class families, and a key contributor to the affordability crisis here in our district,” said Rep. Jones. “That is why U.S. Rep. Suozzi and I, with U.S. Rep. Bowman as a cosponsor, introduced the SALT Deductibility Act. Our bill would fully restore the SALT deduction and put thousands of dollars back into the pockets of hundreds of thousands of working people here in Westchester—money that can be spent on housing, food, transportation, child care, health care, and so much more.”</p>
<p>In January, Reps. Jones and Suozzi, along with U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, introduced the <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/web-exclusive/salt-cap-repeal-bill-introduced-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SALT Deductibility Act</strong></a>, which would remove the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction and bring urgently needed, direct tax relief to impacted homeowners</p>
<p>“We are in a battle to save New York! Every day the SALT cap remains in place, New Yorkers hurt. The SALT cap is crushing New York and many other high-cost progressive states,” said Rep. Suozzi. “Higher income residents are fleeing our state for lower-taxed states that don’t provide the same level of services. As New York loses population, we also lose influence in the Congress even though we are the largest net donor to the federal government. My top priority in Congress remains to repeal this unfair cap on our state and local tax deduction.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The SALT deduction cap passed during the Trump administration has caused financial distress for so many of my constituents,&#8221; U.S. Rep. Bowman said. “We are dealing with the worst pandemic in 100 years, which has devastated our communities, and must do everything we can to put money back into the hands of New Yorkers and make people whole. I’m proud to co-sponsor this legislation which would do just that by eliminating the cap on SALT deductions.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The largest tax increase hardworking Westchester residents have seen was the elimination of the SALT Tax Cap by the GOP controlled Congress in 2017. This tax increase most greatly impacts middle-class Westchester residents who are already struggling,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer. “Thanks to Congressmen Suozzi, Jones and Bowman, and our U.S. Senators Schumer and (Kirsten) Gillibrand, the SALT Deductibility Act will reverse this added burden and provide much needed relief to residents who choose to live in Westchester because of all it has to offer. No longer should residents of states with greater public services be forced to carry weight for states that receive more in federal funds then they give.”</p>
<p>&#8220;We love our community, but Westchester is a hard place to try and stretch a dollar,” said White Plains homeowners Ayeshah and Brian Parker. “So, you might imagine, every penny of our income goes towards raising our family. Restoring the SALT deduction would present the opportunity to continue to do our best as parents to provide the quality of life for our children they deserve. and that we work hard to achieve.”</p>
<p>Back in January, a host of other federal and state lawmakers praised the SALT Deductibility Act. Sen. Gillibrand said, “The reinstating of the SALT Deduction will ensure that New York families have more money in their pockets, get much-needed tax relief and will once again be treated fairly.”</p>
<p>New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins noted that over the last three years, “Trump’s unfair attack on Blue States has cost New Yorkers over $30 billion, while wealthy corporations saw tax breaks.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW WINDSOR—At a special meeting of the newly constituted Board of Directors of the Orange County Industrial Development Agency on Tuesday, March 30, the IDA Board voted to terminate the contracts of the managing director of the IDA and its Accelerator programs. On April 5, the chief executive officer of the IDA submitted her resignation.</p>
<p>The Orange County Industrial Development Agency is currently operating under a cloud as its operations are being investigated by the Orange County District Attorney, in partnership with the New York State Comptroller’s Office, and the New Windsor Police Department. In early March, the Orange County Legislature, frustrated over attempts to secure financial documents from the Orange County Industrial Development Agency, voted to remove the entire seven-member IDA Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The newly constituted IDA Board at its March 30th special meeting voted 4-1 with one abstention to terminate contracts for managing director services with Vincent Cozzolino (Orange County IDA Managing Director) and Galileo Technology Group of Kingston on a host of contracts with the agency and its affiliates. According to the resolution, approved by the IDA Board, Cozzolino/Galileo Technology Group Inc. was paid an annual salary of $70,000 a year as managing director of the Orange County Industrial Development Agency.</p>
<p>The IDA also terminated contracts for managing director services that paid Galileo Technology Group: $80,000 for the Orange County Business Accelerator; $72,000 for the Middletown Accelerator campus; $72,000 for the Newburgh and New Windsor Accelerator campuses; $72,000 for the Warwick Accelerator campus; $72,000 for the Highland Falls Accelerator campus and a $125-an-hour fee not to exceed $300,000 for services relating to the Accelerator’s Without Walls program. Not including fees for the Without Walls program, Galileo Technology Group earned a total of $438,000 in annual payments for managing director services for the IDA and the various Accelerator locations.</p>
<p>The Board also approved a resolution by a 5-1 vote to have Orange County Attorney Langdon Chapman coordinate legal services of the various legal counsels engaged by the IDA. The Board, by a 6-0 vote, approved having Orange County Economic Development Director Bill Fioravanti handle economic development responsibilities at the IDA.</p>
<p>On April 5, Orange County IDA Chief Executive Officer Laurie Villasuso resigned from her post after nearly a decade with the organization.</p>
<p>Villasuso in a statement released to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, stated, “I have enjoyed my nearly 10 years in service to the IDA, and am deeply proud of the work I have done for the economic development of Orange County. However, in light of the recent change of direction at the IDA, and uncertainty surrounding my role within the present makeup of the organization, I have decided to resign from my position as the CEO of the Orange County IDA.”</p>
<p>Justin Rodriguez, spokesman for Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, said of the IDA actions in late March, “County staff will serve the IDA on a temporary basis at the request of the new IDA Board. The IDA will work to be a strong and vital partner in support of creating quality jobs for Orange County while having an efficiently run operation. Orange County is ideally situated for companies that want a high quality workforce, great transportation network and far lower costs than the immediate metropolitan area.”</p>
<p>The IDA Board also elected Mike Torelli as its chairman; John Douthit as vice chairman; Tyler Etzel as second vice chairman; Leslie Pierri as secretary and Vincent Odock as assistant secretary. The Board also announced assignments to its Audit, Governance, Accelerator and Human Resources committees.</p>
<p><strong>Major Cannabis Project Secures Incentives</strong></p>
<p>The Board also approved incentives for a $150-million cannabis cultivation, extraction and manufacturing facility project at the Warwick Office &amp; Technology Corporate Park to be developed by Chicago-based Green Thumb Industries. The approval by a 5-0 vote with one abstention came the night before Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill legalizing recreational marijuana for those 21 year of age and older.</p>
<p>Rebecca Brown, Market President/New York for Green Thumb Industries, said at the IDA session that once all approvals are secured, the firm would move ahead with the first phase of the project that will involve more than $30 million in construction costs, approximately $8 million in the purchase of equipment and fixtures, as well as the cost of acquisition of the 38.1-acre parcel.</p>
<p>The total project will involve the construction of more than 400,000 square feet of new industrial space. According to IDA documents, the firm expects the project to create more than 175 jobs in its first three years of operation. The IDA approved incentives as well as a 15-year PILOT for the project.</p>
<p>Green Thumb Industries spokesperson Linda Marsicano said of the IDA’s approval of incentives, “We are grateful for the Warwick community for their support in the approval of the proposed tax incentives for what we hope will be the future home of our New York cultivation facility. It’s especially meaningful to have Green Thumb&#8217;s Warwick facility incentives application approved on the same day the New York state legislature passed adult-use legislation that will provide New Yorkers 21 and over access to well-being via safe and regulated cannabis products while advancing social equity and criminal justice reforms.”</p>
<p>She added, “Green Thumb looks forward to creating more jobs and tax revenue while giving back to the community in ways that will make a positive impact. It’s fitting that a former prison that incarcerated people for cannabis during the failed war on drugs could now employ people to make cannabis products that can help people feel better and improve quality of life. We are hopeful Green Thumb will receive all of the necessary regulatory approvals to move forward.”</p>
<p>No timeframe on when construction on the project could begin was released.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As the year goes flying by a great deal has been happening at the state and federal level. At the federal level, the PPP deadline has been extended by Congress. This will help assist many businesses who are in line more time to apply for and receive much needed funds to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The American Rescue Plan, passed and signed into law by Congress, includes $25 billion for landlords which will help with lost back rent allowing for property maintenance and payment of property to state and local governments. Eviction moratoriums have worn out their use at this time. Many renters owe back rent of tens of thousands of dollars and have no means for paying that money back. In addition, there are renters who have the means to pay their monthly rent but are choosing not to do so.</p>
<p>At the state level, both houses of the legislature have passed their budget resolutions with billions of dollars in new taxes. HGAR is stridently opposed to any new real estate transfer taxes, mortgage recording taxes or the pied-a-terre tax which would tax homes in New York City valued at $300,000 or more a year. The State Senate also has a bill that would impose a 20% tax on homes that are bought and sold in less than one year in New York City. The goal of the legislators is to stop the flipping of housing units. This would have a negative effect on property ownership in the city as it would serve to drive down property values. Neighborhoods and properties would fall into disrepair.</p>
<p>On a local level, we finally have a co-op reform bill that has been formally introduced in the legislature. It calls for fines for failure to notify the Human Rights Commission of rejections, starting at $1,000 for a first offense, $1,500 for a second offense and $2,000 for a third offense. This bill is a big step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Please respond to the call for action urging the BOL to pass it. Stay tuned for updates on these matters.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York State Supreme Court Judge Susan Kushner issued a ruling that is being viewed as a major victory for the real estate industry, terming Department of State guidance that banned New York State apartment tenants from paying broker fees “an error of law.”</p>
<p>The ruling, first reported by <em>The Real Deal</em>, was handed down on April 9. Albany Supreme Court Judge Kushner stated in her ruling, “The guidance was issued in error of law and represents an unlawful intrusion upon the power of the Legislature and constitutes an abuse of discretion.”</p>
<p>Judge Kushner’s ruling also bars the Department of State from applying or enforcing any rule that would prevent a real estate licensee from receiving payment from a prospective tenant for “bringing about the meeting of the minds” between a landlord and tenant. It also permanently prevents state regulators from imposing any disciplinary action against licensees who collect broker fees from tenants.</p>
<p>The judge also stated in her ruling that &#8220;where the Guidance seeks to extend an unauthorized interpretation of the statute upon real estate brokers, agents, or salespersons, including discipline thereof, it is likewise an abuse of discretion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DOS guidance was issued on Jan. 31, 2020 as part of a sweeping update of DOS regulations and signified a reversal of the long-standing practice where tenants pay the agent’s commission in New York City and elsewhere in New York State.</p>
<p>The real estate industry reacted swiftly in opposition to the new guidance and filed an Article 78 proceeding on Feb. 10, 2020 that termed the new guidance by the Department of State on brokerage commissions as “misguided” and “harmful.”</p>
<p>Among the plaintiffs in the case were the New York State Association of Realtors and the Manhattan-based Real Estate Board of New York and a host of major New York City residential brokerage firms, including: Bohemia Realty Group, New York Real Estate Corp., The Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman Real Estate, Halstead Real Estate, Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales, LLC, Sotheby’s International Realty, R New York, Kian Realty NYC, LLC, Regina Wierbowski Real Estate, LLC, Level Group Inc. and City Connections Realty, Inc. The suit charged that the DOS overstepped its legal authority and usurped its role by engaging in improper rulemaking rather than following the necessary and required legal procedures for implementing a new regulation.</p>
<p>A temporary restraining order on the DOS imposing those regulations was issued on Feb. 10, 2020.</p>
<p>2020 NYSAR President Jennifer Stevenson, when NYSAR originally filed suit against the DOS regulation, said, “The New York State Association of Realtors is deeply concerned with the regulation’s content and the manner in which it was developed and promulgated. Real estate brokers provide valuable services to the consumer and the property owners and they should be fairly compensated. These regulations will severely and wrongly impact the incomes of hard-working real estate professionals.”</p>
<p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty said in response to Judge Kushner&#8217;s ruling, &#8220;I applaud the New York State Association of Realtors for taking such swift action and devoting the necessary financial resources in arguing for the reversal of the DOS opinion limiting who may pay real estate commissions. The court recognized that these practices should be determined by the free market and not dictated by a regulatory body.&#8221;</p>
<p>REBNY President James Whelan in a prepared statement released shortly after Judge Kushner’s ruling on April 9, said, “This decision ensures that thousands of hardworking, honest real estate agents across New York State can earn commissions without fear of unwarranted discipline by the Department of State based on its erroneous interpretation of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act.”</p>
<p>At press time, the  Department of State had not indicated whether it would appeal Judge Kushner’s ruling.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Two years ago, on March 4, 2019, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York in Francis v. Kings Park Manor, Inc. (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2Kd38bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2Kd38bo</a>) (“Kings Park Manor I”) held that a landlord could be liable under the Federal Fair Housing Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2WBzEdH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2WBzEdH</a>) and the New York State Human Rights Law (see https://dhr.ny.gov/law) for failing to protect a tenant from harassment and discrimination by another tenant. At the time, it was an important decision as it was only the second time a court imposed an obligation on a landlord to take affirmative steps to curtail tenant-on-tenant discrimination.</p>
<p>More than two years later, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed course and, in a decision issued on March 25, 2021 (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2Ov4rpX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2Ov4rpX</a>) (“Kings Park Manor II”), held that “…landlords cannot be presumed to have the degree of control over tenants that would be necessary to impose liability under the FHA for tenant-on-tenant misconduct.” This decision now limits the exposure that landlords and property managers have under the FHA and NYSHRL.</p>
<p><strong>Revisiting the Facts in Francis</strong></p>
<p>Donahue Francis (the “Plaintiff”), an African American individual, signed a lease with Kings Park Manor, Inc. (the “Landlord”) for the rental of his apartment in 2010. In February, 2012, another tenant, Plaintiff’s next-door neighbor, Raymond Endres (the “Tenant-Defendant”), engaged in racially discriminatory and threatening behavior and harassment toward the Plaintiff. The Tenant-Defendant used extreme profanity and made racially inflammatory remarks. The Plaintiff was continuously harassed and threatened while in his apartment, in the building, and in the parking lot of the complex. The behavior continued for nearly one year.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff called the police several times about the behavior. On one occasion an officer in the Police Department’s Hate Crimes Division visited the apartment complex and warned the next-door neighbor to stop his behavior. The officer also informed the Landlord and the property manager about what had occurred. The Plaintiff filed a formal police report. The Landlord did not address the situation. The behavior continued, and in May, 2012, the Plaintiff called the police once again and filed another police report. This time, he wrote a formal letter to the Landlord regarding the Tenant-Defendant’s conduct. Again, the Landlord and the Landlord’s property manager did not respond to the Plaintiff’s letter. The behavior became even more aggressive, and, in August, 2012, the Tenant-Defendant was arrested for aggravated harassment. The Tenant eventually filed a lawsuit against the Landlord and the Landlord’s management agent (collectively, the “Landlord Defendants”), as well as the Tenant-Defendant for discrimination and violations under the FHA and NYSHRL.</p>
<p><strong>Kings Park Manor I</strong></p>
<p>In Kings Park Manor I, a panel of three judges from the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals heard the initial appeal from the District Court case. The central issue involved “…whether a landlord may be liable under the FHA for failing to take prompt action to address a racially hostile housing environment created by one tenant targeting another, where the landlord knew of the discriminatory conduct and had the power to correct it.” The three-judge panel relied on the broad interpretation of the language of the FHA and rules issued by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and held that landlords may be held liable under certain circumstances for violating the FHA and other fair housing laws due to certain discriminatory behavior of tenants toward other tenants.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals’ three-judge panel, in reversing the decision of the District Court, held that a landlord may be held liable, in certain instances, for failing to affirmatively act and protect another tenant by utilizing certain rights and remedies the landlord may have under the terms of a lease agreement with the tenant in question or which may be available to a landlord at law. As part of the panel’s decision, it remanded the case back to the District Court for a retrial. The Defendants, however, appealed the panel’s decision and requested a rehearing “en banc,” whereby all of the judges of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals would rehear the appeal. A majority of the judges of the 2nd Circuit ultimately agreed to grant the Landlord Defendants an en banc rehearing, which took place in September 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Kings Park Manor II</strong></p>
<p>In Kings Park Manor II, all of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals judges reviewed the three-judge panel’s dismissal of the District Court’s decision on a de novo basis. The Court Appeals explained that the FHA makes it unlawful “to discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race…” and that “when…a plaintiff brings a claim under the FHA that does not rest on direct evidence of landlord discrimination, we analyze the claim under the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework first developed in Title VII cases.” The McDonnell Douglas analysis requires a plaintiff to establish the following in order to avoid the case from being dismissed:</p>
<p>[1] the plaintiff is a member of a protected class,</p>
<p>[2] the plaintiff suffered an adverse action, and</p>
<p>[3] the plaintiff has at least minimal support for the proposition that the housing provider was motivated by discriminatory intent.</p>
<p>The court held that while the Plaintiff was a member of a protected class, the Plaintiff did not establish that the landlord’s action, or in this case inaction, was motivated by a discriminatory intent. The court points out that the Plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence establishing that the Landlord Defendants were acting with a discriminatory intent toward the Plaintiff simply by not evicting or dealing with the Tenant-Defendant directly.</p>
<p><strong>The Deliberate Indifference Theory of Liability, Substantial Control Over Tenant</strong></p>
<p>The Plaintiff also attempted to establish that the Landlord Defendants engaged in intentional discrimination under a deliberate indifference theory of liability. The court explained that “this theory of liability has been applied almost exclusively in custodial environments, such as public schools and prisons, where it is clear that the defendant has both ‘substantial control over the context in which harassment occurs’ and ‘a custodial [power over the harasser] &#8230;permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults.’” The court held that the landlord-tenant relationship between the Plaintiff and Defendant did not rise to the level of “substantial control” nor was there “a custodial power” over the person engaging in the harassment.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals in Kings Park Manor II ultimately held that the Plaintiff failed to state a claim because the complaint did not provide any factual basis establishing that the Landlord Defendants had “…substantial control over [Tenant-Defendant] and the context in which the known harassment occurred.” The court held that no such “…control [could] be reasonably presumed to exist in the typically arms-length relationship between landlord and tenant, unlike the custodial environments of schools and prisons.” The court stated that “the typical powers of a landlord over a tenant—such as the power to evict—do not establish the substantial control necessary to state a deliberate indifference claim under the FHA.”</p>
<p>The court also noted that even if the Plaintiff did establish that there was substantial control, in order establish a “deliberate indifference” claim, a plaintiff must show that the Defendant’s response to the “…harassment by a third party was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.” The court ultimately held that the Landlord Defendants’ inaction was not “clearly unreasonable” under the circumstances because the Landlord Defendants were aware of the police involvement and, ultimately, the Tenant-Defendant was arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Landlord’s Obligations Under New York Law</strong></p>
<p>The Court of Appeals in Kings Park Manor II explained that under New York law, landlords do have a duty “…to take reasonable precautionary measures to protect members of the public from the reasonably foreseeable criminal acts of third persons&#8230;on the premises.” However, the court goes to explain that generally under New York tort law “…a landlord has no general duty to protect tenants even from ‘the criminal acts of yet another tenant, since it cannot be said that a landlord has the ability or a reasonable opportunity to control [the offending tenant]’ and the ‘power to evict cannot be said to . . . furnish’ such control.” New York similarly does not impose liability on a landlord for the acts of a tenant.</p>
<p><strong>The Court’s Reversal Does Not Lessen </strong><strong>The Importance of Fair Housing</strong></p>
<p>The decision in Kings Park Manor II has alleviated some of the burden placed on landlords and management agents with respect to added liability under fair housing laws and their relationship with tenants. And, while the Court of Appeals has made clear that the liability of landlords has been lessened, the decision does not completely let landlords off the hook. A closer reading of the decision does leave open the potential of liability in the event “substantial control” is able to be established—although the burden of proof on a plaintiff is still high. Nevertheless, it is important that agents, landlords, management agents, and other real estate professionals be aware of the fair housing laws and the liability that exists when there is a violation.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>People are out and ready to buy. Offers are coming in by the boatload. Highest and best is the order of the day. Today, the market is hot and, as a result, I am getting calls and e-mails about the presentation of offers. Sometimes concern arises after a cooperating agent learns that the listing broker has the buyer/tenant with the accepted offer. Other times the concern comes from a cooperating agent that is certain they had the best offer, and they didn’t get the deal. Still other concerns arise when there is a question of possible discrimination. Either way, the inquiry and request for guidance often comes too late. So, this article will look at the best practices for ensuring that your offer is properly presented.</p>
<p><strong>OneKey MLS Offer Acknowledgment Form And the Sworn Declaration Statement</strong></p>
<p>OneKey MLS Rules and Procedures Section 406 provides a mechanism for a cooperating agent to confirm that their offer was presented. Under Rule 406.1 a cooperating broker can submit with an offer a request for completion of an Offer Acknowledgment Form. This form sets forth the terms and conditions of the offer and provides for signed acknowledgement from the owner that the offer was presented. This form is then returned to the cooperating agent. (See Rule 406.2, 406.3). If the owner refuses or is unable to sign the Offer Acknowledgment Form, then the listing agent (or any other licensee of the office) must provide a Sworn Declaration Statement to the cooperating broker stating that the offer was presented to the owner. (See Rule 406.4).</p>
<p><strong>Timing and Fines</strong></p>
<p>Most importantly, under Rule 406.5, either the Offer Acknowledgment Form or the Declaration Statement must be returned to the cooperating broker within two hours. Even if an offer is presented without a request for the completion of the above forms, a cooperating broker may still make the request at some point after the offer is presented. The only difference is that the listing agent must provide the appropriate documentation within 24 hours.</p>
<p>If the listing agent fails to timely provide the executed documents, the cooperating broker may contact a Rules Enforcement Facilitator for assistance. Failure to provide the documents to the Facilitator will prompt an automatic fine of $250, which will double to $500 if it is not resolved in one day. The fine will increase to $750 if not resolved within three days and can rise to $1,500 if not resolved within five or more days (or it may be referred to the MLS Rules Enforcement Committee for a hearing).</p>
<p><strong>Code of Ethics Affirmation of Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The OneKey Rules and Procedures isn’t the only vehicle through which a cooperating broker can request proof of an offer presentation. The Code of Ethics under Article 1, Standard of Practice 1-7 states:</p>
<p><em>Under written request of a cooperating broker who submits an offer to the listing broker, the listing broker shall provide, as soon as practical, a written affirmation to the cooperating broker stating that the offer has been submitted to the seller/landlord, or a written notification that the seller/landlord has waived the obligation to have the offer presented.</em></p>
<p>Under this provision, when a cooperating broker presents an offer, similar to the OneKey Rules and Procedures, they can request that an affirmation be filled out by the agent attesting that the offer was presented. The response must be given “as soon as practical” and this may be interpreted as referencing the timing of OneKey Rule 406.5 (either two hours or 24 hours, whichever is applicable). Failure to provide the response, or a written notice from the seller/landlord that they have waived the obligation to have offers presented, within this time period may be deemed a violation of the Code of Ethics and subject the offending party to discipline that can range for a letter of warning, to up to a $15,000 fine, and possible membership or MLS suspension.</p>
<p><strong>Cooperating Broker’s Right to Present Offers</strong></p>
<p>A little known and rarely used OneKey MLS Rules and Procedures provision provides one additional way a cooperating broker may confirm that their offer is presented. Under Rule 405.4 a cooperating broker (or representative) has the right to “participate in the presentation to the seller or lessor of any offer he secures to purchase or lease, unless instructed otherwise by the seller in writing.” This provision means that the cooperating broker can physically be present if the listing broker presents the offer in person. If the offer is being presented via e-mail, the cooperating broker must be cc’d. If the offer is being presented over the phone, the cooperating broker must be on that call. Through this provision, the cooperating broker can confirm that not only was the offer presented, but that it was presented objectively (Code of Ethics Article 1, Standard of Practice 1-6 requires all offers to be presented objectively). If, the seller or lessor has waived this right in writing, the cooperating broker must be provided a copy of this writing within two hours of the request.</p>
<p>What this provision does not permit is that the cooperating broker can dictate when the offer or how the offer is presented. It also does not permit the cooperating broker to be present for any discussions or evaluations of that offer.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The OneKey MLS Offer Acknowledgment Form and the Sworn Declaration Statement can be found on the HGAR website under Resources/Document Library/MLS Listing Agreement and Forms, or by clicking on the following links: <a href="https://www.hgar.com/api/document/preview/48647" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OFFER ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.hgar.com/api/document/preview/48578" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>REALTOR DECLARATION</strong></a>.</p>
<p>With the proper implementation of these forms and the application of these rules, a cooperating broker can obtain the security of knowing that all offers are property presented in an efficient, timely and objective manner. No Realtor should be left in the dark wondering if their offer was presented or whether some unscrupulous agent is trying to gain the upper hand in today’s already aggressive real estate market.</p>

<div id="attachment_36153" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buchanan.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36153" class="wp-image-36153" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Buchanan.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36153" class="wp-caption-text">The Buchanan Village circle with clocktower</p></div>
<p>While the plant’s closing has been applauded by environmentalists, local government leaders are working feverishly to fill the massive financial crater that will be left behind including: a $24-million per year loss for the Hendrick Hudson School District; $4 million for Westchester County; $3 million for the Village of Buchanan; $800,000 for the Town of Cortlandt and $400,000 each for the Verplanck Fire District and Hendrick Hudson Free Library.</p>
<p>Indian Point, owned by Entergy, has been the largest employer and taxpayer in the Town of Cortlandt. More than 900 employees will be affected, and government and business leaders worry about the impact the closure will have on local businesses.</p>
<p>Cortlandt Town Supervisor Linda Puglisi and Buchanan Mayor Theresa Knickerbocker have been leading task forces to plan for the future of the region since 2017, when they first learned of plans to shutter Indian Point 3. “I remember we were both shocked when we found out—from a newspaper article,” recalled Puglisi. “We had no prior knowledge of this, but we went into action right away.”</p>
<p>The task forces they set up included local government and business leaders, and later became part of the New York State task force. Joseph Lippolis, broker/owner of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Rivertowns Real Estate, served on the town task force.</p>
<p>Lippolis and his wife Cynthia have offices in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill. “I think everyone’s concern early on was that there would be a mass exodus from the area,” recalled Lippolis. “But what we’ve actually seen is the normal ebb and flow of the marketplace. In fact, in today’s market, we’re experiencing a shortage of inventory in Buchanan, just like the rest of the lower Hudson Valley.”</p>
<p>The medium home price in Buchanan remains at close to $400,000, and at the end of February, 23 homes sales closed. Lippolis indicates that’s about average for the community. “It’s still a seller’s market here,” he added.</p>
<p>Lippolis said news of Indian Point 3’s closing has not deterred potential homebuyers from exploring the village. “We get a mix of people locally and from New York City, and a lot of first-time homebuyers,” he said. “We haven’t seen any abandoned blocks of property or homes—there’s always someone to fill the properties that become available.”</p>
<div id="attachment_36152" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Indian-Pt-Pool.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36152" class="wp-image-36152" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Indian-Pt-Pool.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="208" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36152" class="wp-caption-text">The former swimming pool at Indian Point Park (photo courtesy of the Peekskill Museum)</p></div>
<p>One of the perks of living in the Town of Cortlandt has been lower taxes, due to the presence of Indian Point. “As it closes down, taxes may increase but I think the fact that the plant will no longer be functioning there will also bring more people in,” said Lippolis.</p>
<p>Don Dwyer, associate broker with Howard Hanna | Rand Realty in Yorktown Heights, serves on the Cortlandt Community Coalition task force and another task force created to deal with the plant decommissioning process. He is also a founding member of the advocacy group, Power Through Cortlandt. A resident of Montrose, Dwyer has been listing and selling homes in the area for many years. “Many of the families in Montrose, Buchanan and Verplanck are multi-generational and some homes haven’t been sold in over 40 years,” he said. “I think that could start to change a bit when the taxes eventually start to catch up with other parts of Westchester County.”</p>
<p>Once the plant closes, Puglisi explained that the town and village will be receiving cessation funds set up by New York State for the next seven years to help bridge the gap from the taxes they had been receiving. “It’s not a cure-all,” reminded Puglisi, “it’s just a temporarily solution.” However, a bill recently signed into law will give the Town of Cortlandt the ability to tax the property that will hold the plant’s spent fuel rods in 125 concrete casks.</p>
<p>“I think what we may start to see is more of an equalization in taxes with neighboring communities and families, and those who have the money to pay the higher taxes will be moving in,” added Dwyer. For right now, though, it’s still a seller’s market with homes garnering multiple offers. “We’re still seeing properties snatched up in about three days,” he said.</p>
<p>The Hendrick Hudson School District will be hit the hardest, losing about 30% of its annual budget. Even with the cessation funds, the district will be receiving only $61 million over the next eight years, as opposed to an average of $200 million over that same time period when the plant was active. “It’s true that Indian Point kept our school taxes artificially low,” said Superintendent Joseph Hochreiter. “In fact, we’ve had one of the lowest annual tax increases in Westchester with about 1.65% each year from 2013 to 2020.”</p>
<p>Hochreiter noted that the area’s low taxes have also kept many people in the area from selling their homes and moving once their children graduated from high school. “As a result, we’ve seen about a 10% decline in elementary school enrollment over the last 10 years,” he added.</p>
<p>The school board is now considering a cost savings initiative that would designate their three elementary schools to accommodate specific grade levels. The Princeton Plan would basically remove location borders and allow students to move through the three schools together by grade levels. “Under that plan, for example, one school might be set up for kindergarten though grade two, while the next could be for grades three to five, and so on,” explained Hochreiter. “This could save us anywhere from $1.75 million to $2.2 million a year. Also, by organizing students this way, every school program will stay intact.”</p>
<p>Hochreiter indicated that the school board will prepare two budgets this year—one with the status quo and the other with the &#8220;Princeton Plan.&#8221; “It’s fair to say that even with the savings, the days of the 1.65% tax increase may be behind us,” he revealed. “Projected increases could run anywhere from 2.4% to 7% per year, but we will still be much lower compared to neighboring districts like Lakeland, Yorktown and Croton.”</p>

<p>Centuries ago, no one would have ever conceived of the notion of a nuclear power plant sitting on the banks of the Hudson River. The earliest recorded use of the land in the 17th century was settlements by the Kitchewonk native Americans, who later began trading with European explorers, including Henry Hudson. Simple wigwams and crops dotted the landscape that would be replaced by reactor domes some 300 years in the future.</p>
<p>Almost 100 years ago, the land had been transformed into a sought-after recreation destination for people in lower Westchester and New York City. Indian Point Park, a 320-acre property, served as both a pleasure park and amusement park from 1923 to 1956.</p>
<p>The book, “Lost Amusement Parks of the Hudson Valley,” by Wesley and Barbara Gottock, describes how Indian Point Park and others made their debut at the turn of the 20th Century. Barbara Gottock recently spoke at the Peekskill Museum’s “History of Indian Point” presentation, divulging some little-known, yet fascinating details about the former home of three nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>According to Gottock, the park was owned by the Hudson River Dayliner Boat Company, and one of the largest boats, the “Washington Irving,” could transport as many as 6,600 people. “The boats had bands on board to entertain people as they made their way up the Hudson River from the city,” she explained. “Then once they arrived at Indian Point Park, people could relax at the swimming pool, take a speed boat ride and go over to the dance hall later.&#8221; Local farms also provided food for the guests.</p>
<p>In 1949, the park was purchased by Emanuel Kelmans, who added a parking lot, as more people were beginning to own cars. “Kelmans started to add amusements to the park, as well as concession stands,” added Gottock. Soon, it became a fully operational amusement park. “Rides were 10 cents each, and three for a quarter, and the Westchester County Fair was actually held there for three years,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>By 1954, however, the popularity of the park began to dwindle and Kelmans decided to sell the property to Con Edison for $250,000. The park remained in operation for the next two years, and finally closed operations in 1956.</p>
<p><strong>The Beginning of Nuclear Power in Westchester</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_36154" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Indian-Pt-Amusement-pk-1-e1618333205901.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36154" class="wp-image-36154" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Indian-Pt-Amusement-pk-1-e1618333205901.png" alt="" width="375" height="211" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36154" class="wp-caption-text">Indian Point Park -from the Peekskill Museum</p></div>
<p>Completed by Con Edison in 1962 at a cost of $1.25 million, Indian Point 1 was the first privately-funded project of its kind in the U.S. “The primary component, the reactor vessel, weighed 230 tons and was 40 feet long with 120 fuel assemblies,” noted Brian Vangor, Entergy Control Room Supervisor at a recent presentation of the “History of Indian Point” by the Peekskill Museum.</p>
<p>In October of 1974, Indian Point 1 shut down due to non-compliance with the Atomic Energy Commission’s new criteria for an emergency core cooling system. However, Indian Point 2, which had been under construction since 1966, had already been online since August of 1974. Construction on Indian Point 3, which began in 1968, became operational in 1975, the same year Con Edison sold it to the New York Power Authority. The third and final reactor vessel weighed 500 tons.</p>
<p>In 2000, Indian Point 3 was sold to Entergy, and just a year later, Entergy also acquired reactors 1 and 2. Indian Point 2 was eventually shut down in April 2020. Once Indian Point 3 closes, Entergy intends to sell it to Holtec International for decommissioning. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already approved the transfer of licenses to Holtec. The company has previously received approvals to purchase the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey and the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>“Once Holtec closes on the property, we can all meet to discuss the eventual redevelopment of the area,” said Knickerbocker. “We’ve actually been talking about this for the past four years and we’ll be using every tool in the toolkit to help our taxpayers.”</p>
<p>The 240-acre parcel that housed the reactors will first have to go through an intense cleanup before it could be ready development, possibly by the 2030’s. However, Puglisi and Knickerbocker are hopeful that the northern and southern areas bordering the plants may become available sooner. “Those areas are not contaminated, so we’re optimistic about the potential for that land,” said Puglisi. “The entire property will have to be rezoned and we’re anticipating some type of mixed used development that would help bring ratables back to the village of Buchanan.”</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Both town and village officials are working with the Hudson Valley Gateway Chamber of Commerce to help the more than 200 local businesses maintain their operations. “While businesses will be losing some customers, I think the fact that Holtec will still be retaining about 300 employees will help,” said Deborah Malone, Chamber president. “We are hoping that the town will eventually be able to bring in some type of developments that bring more jobs to the area. Local employees will help to support local businesses.”</p>
<div id="attachment_36150" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Quarry.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36150" class="wp-image-36150" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Quarry.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36150" class="wp-caption-text">Quarry Park in Verplanck, site of a former quarry and possible home to new developments</p></div>
<p>The pandemic, of course, has affected all types of businesses throughout our region and the rest of the nation. “The business community as a whole has already been struggling over the past year and we’re still not back to any type of ‘normal’ yet,” she added.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Town of Cortlandt is reaching out to potential developers and business owners to attract them to the town’s four strategic growth areas: Transit-Oriented District, adjacent to the Metro-North Railroad station; Medical Oriented District, surrounding New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital on Route 202; Cortlandt Boulevard Area, along Route 6 and the Waterfront Sustainability District in the hamlet of Verplanck.</p>
<p>Quarry Park, which currently houses an old, abandoned quarry in Verplanck, is at the center of the Town of Cortlandt’s waterfront revitalization plan. The property features an 800-foot deep water quarry surrounded by natural stone walls and acres of open space for a potential public/private partnership.</p>
<p>Phase One includes plans for an athletic village with indoor sports, which Cortlandt Pitch is currently considering. Merchant’s Daughter, a hard cider producer, is also viewing Quarry Park for a possible location along the Hudson River that could include an outdoor tasting area.</p>
<p>In Phase Two of the plans, the town would seek some type of aquatic recreation at the quarry, while Phase Three could bring in a restaurant or Discovery Center. The fourth and final phase would link a waterfront boardwalk to 6th Street and existing sidewalks and trails.</p>
<p>In addition to concerns about securing more sources for tax revenue, Puglisi and Knickerbocker are equally worried about having enough electric power to sustain the Town of Cortlandt. “The Public Service Commission keeps telling us there will be enough power, since they now plan to rely on nearby gas-fired plants to cover the lost megawatts,” said Knickerbocker. “I do find it strange that many environmentalists believe nuclear energy is so bad, yet gas-fired plants do more polluting to the air than nuclear energy.”</p>
<p>As the town and village look to the future, Knickerbocker’s Citizens Advisory Panel will continue to keep Buchanan residents informed about what’s happening with the closure and its aftermath. “Our goal is to keep communication channels open as we deal with our many concerns—loss of revenue and jobs, the effect on the local businesses and real estate, and expectations for the years ahead,” she said. “We’re remaining optimistic,” added Puglisi. “Our new philosophy about the Town of Cortlandt is ‘where life works’ and we intend to stay committed to making that happen.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The cities of Peekskill in Westchester County and Newburgh in Orange County may be smaller than other major cities in the Hudson Valley, but both have some big development plans in the works.</p>
<p>Peekskill, which has seen major changes over the past 10 years, is gearing up to add five new affordable and market rate residential developments, an independent senior living facility, plus a major revitalization to Fleichmann’s Pier on the Hudson River at Charles Point. Last year, the city secured a $10-million economic development investment from New York State to assist with the many projects now in progress.</p>
<p>“I think what’s attracting developers to Peekskill is the fact that we’re a small city with a lot to offer,” said Jean Friedman, the City’s Director of Planning. “We have already been upgrading the downtown and waterfront areas, we’re right on the Metro-North train line as well as Route 9, and land costs are a lot more reasonable here than in lower Westchester County.”</p>
<p>Because there’s still a steady exodus of people from New York City, Friedman notes that Peekskill represents a very commutable area, lower real estate taxes, and a vibrant walkable downtown with restaurants and art galleries. “It’s a very friendly place to live too,” she added. “Since we’re smaller, people can actually get to know each other.”</p>
<p>The city’s economically-diverse housing developments range from 22 market-rate rentals on South Division Street to 225 units of mixed income housing and commercial space on lower South Street. The new “SoLo” project is currently awaiting site plan approval for the land, owned by the City of Peekskill. “This will be similar to the ‘Lofts on Main’ and will offer affordably-priced one-and two-bedroom apartments,” said Friedman.</p>
<p>The city’s second largest planned development at One Park Place will bring in 181 units of market rate rentals with commercial space on the first floor. Currently under construction, rents are expected to skew slightly less than rentals in White Plains or New Rochelle.</p>
<p>Meantime, noted affordable housing developer Wilder Balter is building a $50.8-million, 82-unit affordable rental project at 645 Main St. Located next to Bohlmann Towers and the Kiley Youth Center, it will feature one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments and a 142-space garage. “There is also some state funding involved,” said Friedman, “and potential renters will have to apply to live there since they’ll have to meet Westchester County’s affordable housing requirements.”</p>
<p>Due for completion by summer of 2022, the development will also feature on-site amenities including a fitness center, clubroom, laundry facility, green roof courtyard and management office.</p>
<p>“There’s still a huge need for affordable housing in Westchester, especially for young people starting out and seniors on a fixed income,” said Friedman. In the meantime, to alleviate some of those needs, a 52-unit independent senior living affordable rental facility is now underway on Route 202 in Peekskill. The project is expected to be completed by early Fall of 2021.</p>
<p>Two smaller projects are also in progress—a 22-unit market rate rental building at 505 South St., which will overlook the Hudson River, and a 22-unit market rate rental on South Division Street.</p>
<p>Across the river in the City of Newburgh, new developments are also on the rise with up to 80 loft-style rentals, a 60-unit condominium redevelopment of an old foundry, new commercial buildings and continued upgrading of the waterfront area.</p>
<p>While it’s no secret that the downtown area has become blighted and crime-ridden over the years, city officials are working hard to change its reputation with new developments and refurbishments of abandoned buildings. “There has been a lot of disinvestment in the community,” admitted Alexandra Church, Economic Development Director for the City of Newburgh. “People have walked away from properties, leaving a lot of neighborhoods vacant. But what we’re starting to see now is a reinvestment in those areas.”</p>
<p>The Newburgh Community Land Bank, a non-profit organization established in 2012, is partnering with developers to rebuild local neighborhoods. Funded in part by New York State, the Land Bank acquires title to vacant and abandoned properties then sells the land to contractors or developers.</p>
<p>The Land Bank is now in partnership with RUPCO Inc. of Kingston, to renovate scattered sites of two to four housing units in a concentrated area. “When complete, these buildings can be available for affordable rental housing,” explained Church. “Priority for housing will be given to local residents.”</p>
<p>Currently, they are working on a five-block area that will involve about 40 structures in total. “For example, 10 years ago South Miller Street was 90% vacant, and now there’s only one building not yet completed on the whole block,” added Church.</p>
<p>Orange County, meantime, will be closing on a deal soon with Foster Supply Hospitality for a hotel and restaurant on Grand Street. The company has built and own small, boutique hotels throughout the Catskills and plans to refurbish the city’s old YMCA, Masonic Temple and American Legion buildings near the SUNY Orange campus. “The plan to keep the buildings intact and revamp the interiors, “said Church. “It’s a great location just two blocks up from the waterfront.”</p>
<p>It was in the early 2000’s that the city began to revitalize the waterfront, which is now a hot spot for both indoor and outdoor dining, as well as boat rides. “I think the fact that our waterfront is now fully developed is what’s piquing interest for developers to start coming up the hill from there,” said Church. “That’s a big push in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Meantime, the Kearney Development Group is looking to replicate it’s Peekskill artist loft style undertaking with a 70-unit to 80-unit rental project about a block from the waterfront on city-owned land.</p>
<p>Another proposed project would create 60 units of either rental or condominium housing at The Foundry—an old foundry building—on South William and Johnes streets. “I think the younger generation is more interested in suburbs that look different and they like to be close to restaurants and nightlife that the waterfront offers,” noted Church.</p>
<p>Three city-owned properties in the east end historic district are also being considered for redevelopment, including the former historic “City Club” building. “We do have a lot of projects in the works, and it seems that people who grew up in the area now want to reinvest in the community and help to change the stigma of Newburgh.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A little more than a year ago, White Plains Mayor Thomas Roach presided over a city that was enjoying a renaissance of new development projects in its Downtown District that promised to reshape the city’s skyline and economy for years to come.</p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2021 and while the COVID-19 pandemic still infects and kills Westchester County residents each day, vaccinations and safety restrictions have many hopeful that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. With that in mind,<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> turned to White Plains Mayor Thomas Roach to discuss how the city is faring, the pandemic’s impact on development and whether it had long-lasting impacts on the city’s fortunes going forward.</p>
<p>In this month’s “Five Questions With” feature, Mayor Roach, who took over as acting mayor of White Plains in February 2011, was elected mayor in a special election shortly thereafter and won election to his first full term in office in November 2013 and re-elected to a second term in November 2017, says he has never seen so many construction cranes in the city before. He also previews what could be a transformative project taking shape at the property he calls “The Great Wall of Galleria”—the Galleria at White Plains property and at the Gateway II site near the White Plains train station.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Has the coronavirus delayed any development projects in the city and with the changing demand COVID-19 has caused, have any projects shifted from say retail to other uses?</p>
<p><strong>Mayor Roach:</strong> So, I would say nothing has been delayed. We had a brief period where construction paused, but the jobs really wanted to keep going, the workers wanted to keep going and as soon as they could reopen they did. For example, White Plains Hospital (expansion) is such a huge project and they are going to complete it on time…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Thomas_Roach_2015.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-36193" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Thomas_Roach_2015.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="375" /></a>I am not seeing this (COVID pandemic) causing any shift in the projects that were approved because the shift away from retail toward residential was already pretty firmly established (pre-pandemic). We have a bunch of residential units under construction right now. There are as many cranes as I can remember seeing up in the city and we have new ones coming. So, it has been very busy—The Mitchell, The Continuum, City Square, Brookfield Commons, which is Windbrook, Waterstone and the Robert Weisz project at 1133 Westchester Ave.—have all been pushing on. So, it is looking good.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What is the status of the city’s quest for development around the White Plains Metro North Station?</p>
<p><strong>Mayor Roach:</strong> There are two parts to this. The first part is the train station improvements ($90-million MTA project) are about to be finished. Along with that was a pretty big grant we received to do infrastructure improvements involving the train station, so we got the new protected bike lane done, we got the new HAWK (traffic) signal that is coming in on Main (Street) and the bike storage facility is being built. There are also a bunch of Transit-Oriented Developments that have been approved down there that have 2,100 units.</p>
<p>In terms of our project at the train station, we received good response to the RFPs (Request for Proposals), which were reviewed by the committee and we are setting up now for me to start talking to some of the developers. So, that is moving forward, but right up the hill Gateway II should be the agenda in April for approval and they are ready to get in the ground.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WP-Mayor-Thomas-Roach-1024x683.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-36190" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WP-Mayor-Thomas-Roach-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Editor’s Note:</strong> The Gateway II project is a long vacant 3.5-acre downtown site calls for 500 apartment units at 85 N. Lexington Ave. in Downtown White Plains. The plan calls for two buildings—a 25-story tower and a 16-story building.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Can you fill us in on when construction will start on the former Westchester Pavilion property, which remains an eyesore featuring a large excavation hole in the center of the CBD? Also, have the plans for the Esplanade property advanced?</p>
<p><strong>Mayor Roach:</strong> So, there is a new owner for the Esplanade coming in and it is our understanding that the new owner wants to move forward on the approved project. It has been bouncing around because they have been talking about doing different things, but the new group that is coming in, who seem to mean business, would go ahead with the approved project.</p>
<p>The Westchester Pavilion property is the same group (Lennar Multifamily) that is building the project at the corner of Post Road and Mamaroneck Avenue that is under construction. So, their plan is to go ahead with the approved project (at the Westchester Pavilion site) and roll the mobilization right over when they get near the end of that one.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Recently, you previewed what is expected to be major changes to the Galleria property in Downtown White Plains. What can you share on this potentially transformative project?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3476-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-36194" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3476-1.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="375" /></a>Mayor Roach:</strong> It is interesting that I keep getting questions from people about what they want to fill the Sears space with. The mall owners (Pacific Retail Capital Partners) are trying to get Sears out of there. So, I think you are going to see the anchor stores go and I think you are going to see a big residential component to it, but still a mall, but a mall of the future. I am just seeing now they are doing stories on malls and what stores aren’t going to be in malls and things like that, but this has been coming for so long that it’s no surprise as the Galleria was already moving forward on this before COVID. There will be more community centers and entertainment forums with retail but not the traditional (makeup) where you walk past any mall in the United States and you walk past the same stores.</p>
<p>What is most exciting to me is that the mall itself, the way it was built, and I have talked about this a lot, it served its purpose, but it is a mega-block that disrupts traffic and makes Main Street in that area desolate and sterile. I call it “The Great Wall of Galleria.” There is no connection to the street and when you come around the corner onto Court Street you have the “Great Wall of Macy’s.” You can’t have a functioning street in the downtown where one side of the street is a blank wall. So, what we have been talking to them about and what I expect to see is that on that side of the street is terraced areas with outdoor dining with spaces for outdoor entertainment that kind of slides right into what we created on that space on Court Street with the brick and into the Renaissance Park with the fountains.</p>
<p>So, we have the ability to create this wonderful outdoor vibe in that part of the city. It is something that I have wanted for so long and the Galleria was the biggest impediment. You know, this development should actually turn the Galleria into the biggest asset down there…</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The mayor later discussed the future look of the Galleria Mall.</p>
<p>The main portion of the mall would be brighter and open and provide an easier and safe passage from let’s say you are at the White Plains Library and want to cross over to what I call the “Death Star”—the Verizon building. You can come directly through the mall and the idea is to improve the flow. The (existing) tunnel is kind of bleak and that would be tuned up dramatically. So, just to brighten it all up and make it all part once again of the community around it is exciting. It is a huge project and that one is not launching tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> A recurring theme has been that White Plains would someday create its own Industrial Development Agency and no longer have its projects incentivized by the Westchester County IDA. Has the city revisited this idea of late or will it continue working with the county IDA for the foreseeable future?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/White_Plains_Mayor_Tom_Roach_007.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-36191" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/White_Plains_Mayor_Tom_Roach_007.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Mayor Roach:</strong> We have pushed for it (the city’s own IDA) but the reality is that Albany is not really interested in doing any new IDAs, that is just the message we get repeatedly. Over time, prior county executives have not wanted, whether they said it openly or not, they have not wanted White Plains to get its own IDA because we’re the main driver for their IDA and the revenue that it brings in. But, George Latimer is different. If we want our own IDA, he supports us getting our own IDA. I just think and we may look at it, but realistically I don’t see it coming. Certainly not anytime soon. So, we have tried to work within the existing structure. Some of the things we did back before George was the County Executive was we took the position that we are not going to waive the sales tax on these projects and we are not waiving the mortgage recording tax. If that doesn’t get worked out, we have the right to object and if we object the deal is done and it can’t go forward. So, we said we were going to start objecting and it was a short conversation. We weren’t threatening… The developer will now write us a check for what would have been the mortgage recording and sales tax. It is not immediate, but it comes when they would have paid it and so we are kind of working within the structure…</p>
<p>We have been talking with them. We have gotten some money for our own economic development, but it has been a small amount. We want to have a serious conversation about more of that money coming our way so we can do our own economic development because the money that they get from these projects comes with a lot of cost but it is economic development for the county and we think it is only fair that we have some money targeted for us to the extent that we are generating revenue.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The first quarter of 2021 was “one for the books” for the suburban New York City residential market.</p>
<p>In the era of COVID-19, residential sales in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area plummeted early on and slowly increased as restrictions were lifted. In the first quarter of 2021, sales skyrocketed to new highs in almost all sections of the region with transactions increasing by astounding rates ranging from as high as 62.4% to 31.6%.</p>
<p>While the level of activity has many veteran Realtors shaking their heads in disbelief, most admit that the feverish level of sales activity will not be sustainable due at least in part to low for-sale inventory levels.</p>
<p>According to the recently released first quarter home sales report by OneKey MLS, Putnam County led the HGAR region with a 62.4% increase in residential sales as compared to the first quarter of 2020 (prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic), followed by Sullivan County at 62.3%; Orange County with 54.2% higher sales; Rockland County, which posted a 36.5% increase in transactions, Westchester County, which notched a 35.3% increase in sales and the Bronx which enjoyed 31.6% higher home sales in the first three months of this year. <strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: For the full OneKey MLS report and charts see pages 15 and 16.</p>
<p>The tremendous surge in home sales was described by the authors of the OneKey MLS report as staggering” and “unprecedented.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HGAR-Market-Area-Home-Sales-First-Quarter-2021.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-36221" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HGAR-Market-Area-Home-Sales-First-Quarter-2021.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>Breaking down units sold, Westchester County saw 2,462 units trade as compared to 1,819 units in 2020. Orange County’s sales rose from 896 units in 2020 to 1,382 units in the first quarter of 2021, Putnam registered 427 sales as compared to 263 in 2020 and Sullivan County closed 362 units from 223 units in 2020. In Rockland County, sales increased to 823 units from 603 in 2020. Sales in Bronx County increased to 567 units this past quarter as compared to 431 units in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>Median single-family home sales prices increased sharply in every area of the HGAR region. The median sale price for a single-family residential unit in Orange County rose 22.5% to $340,000 (from $277,450 one year ago) while Sullivan County’s median price spiked 35.2% to $221,00 from $162,250 one year ago.</p>
<p>The median price for a single-family home in Westchester County rose 10.8% to $708,995 from $640,000 last year. The median sale price for a single-family residence rose by 16.4% in Putnam County to $390,000 (from $335,000), in Rockland County the median price increased by 14.4% to $525,000 (from $459,000) and in Bronx County the median rose 4% to $541,000 (from $520,000) as compared to the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The spike in sales in the first three months of this year was not limited to just single-family homes. The condominium and cooperative markets benefitted from high demand as well. In Westchester County, the region’s top condo and co-op market, sales rose 32.6% and 30.5% respectively. The median sale price for a Westchester condominium fell 3.8% in the first quarter of this year to $375,000, while the co-op median price increased 9.8% in Westchester to $192,750. There was a 40.9% increase in condominium sales in the Bronx in the first quarter of 2021, while cooperative sales jumped 21.2% in that same time period. The median sale price of a Bronx condo rose 10.3% in the first quarter of this year to $305,000, while a Bronx co-op’s median price increased 20.5% to $244,000.</p>
<p>While most data points point to a very bullish home sales market going forward, declining inventory levels are giving real estate professionals some pause. End of quarter inventory was down 13.2% in Westchester; 52.0% in Rockland; 52.6% in Orange; 49.9% in Sullivan and 53.2% in Putnam. While single-family inventory was down 21.4% in the Bronx, inventory increases in other market segments caused overall inventory to rise 19.2% in the borough in the first quarter.</p>
<p>While prices are rising, Realtors contend that the current market presents opportunities for sellers, due to low inventory and buyers thanks to low interest rates. They also expressed hope that inventory levels will rise in the coming months to accommodate the strong buyer demand.</p>
<p>HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska described the level of activity in the first quarter as a “madhouse” when it came to the sense of urgency and competition that took place in the market. She recalled, “Properties were coming off the market within three or four days.”</p>
<p>The level of activity raises some concerns for Syska, who is an Associate Broker with Keller Williams NY Realty of White Plains. She noted that the sales activity is simply not sustainable.</p>
<p>She did note that Realtors are beginning to see more properties coming on the market and a rising consumer confidence due to the COVID vaccination efforts now underway.</p>
<p>However, Realtors should begin to prepare for changing market conditions now and look to educate their prospective buyers who in the future may get frustrated.</p>
<p>Syska also cautioned, “It is usually in this type of (sales) environment that we can make the most mistakes,” she said. “So, we have to really pay attention to our practice, especially because of fair housing.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer at Howard Hana | Rand Realty, said that the northern suburban markets of New York City had been slowly recovering from the downturn in 2009 and suffered a setback due to the imposition of the SALT cap beginning in 2018.</p>
<p>“Now the market has just exploded in the last year and even COVID hasn’t been able to hold it back, the SALT cap hasn’t been able to hold it back and that is why we are starting to see all-time highs in a lot of these markets for sales and prices,” Rand said in a webinar presentation of the firm’s first quarter home sales report for its market area.</p>
<p>Brokerage firm Houlihan Lawrence in its first quarter market report noted that the inventory shortage has made it challenging for buyers looking to relocate out of the city and for sellers to make a move.</p>
<p>“If the opportunity avails, there is no better time to list your home. There is high demand in all three counties and most price points. The number of showings has increased considerably year over year, and with fewer homes on the market, it is typical to have more than one buyer interested in a property. This is creating multiple bid situations on properly priced homes, and sellers are reaping the benefit,” said Elizabeth Nunan, president and CEO, Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>The strong sales market in the first quarter extended to the luxury sector. Sales of luxury homes of $2 million and higher in New York’s northern suburban markets in the first quarter of this year registered double- and triple-digit gains compared to 12 months earlier. Robust buyer demand during the typically slow holiday period of late fall/early winter yielded the strongest first quarter of closed sales in a decade, according to the Houlihan Lawrence Luxury Market Report.</p>
<p>“One year ago, when the country was in a COVID-19 lockdown, it was hard to imagine that residential real estate would experience a V-shaped recovery fueled by seismic shifts in consumer behavior. Luxury real estate north of New York City is the beneficiary of these well-documented changes. A substantially larger buyer pool coupled with declining inventory has generated a consistent rise in luxury sales since last summer,” said Anthony P. Cutugno, senior vice president, director of private brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Representatives of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. made a presentation to the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency this morning on an amended expansion plan for property in the Town of Greenburgh that will involve a total of nearly a half billion dollars of investment.</p>
<p>Janet Giris, a partner with the law firm DelBello, Donnellan &amp; Weingarten, Wise &amp; Wiederkeher, LLP who represented Regeneron at the IDA session, noted that the new project is an expansion of its Parcel D project originally proposed in 2015 as a building not to exceed 192,000 square feet that secured Westchester IDA approval, but never moved forward.</p>
<p>“Recently, Regeneron has been reevaluating its long-term space needs and determined that the originally approved Building D no longer meets its needs,” she said.</p>
<p>Giris said that Regeneron plans to submit an amended incentives application with the IDA for its new project that would involve the construction of a new two-story, 207,000-square-foot building, along with a parking structure and other infrastructure that will increase the development cost of the project (including equipment) by approximately $331 million to $480 million.</p>
<p>In its presentation, Regeneron estimates that construction costs will total $310 million, design costs $21.7 million and FF&amp;E (furniture, fixtures and equipment) $148.9 million. The cost of the original project was estimated at $150 million. The firm estimated the tax savings it will secure will net approximately $7.7 million.</p>
<p>The new building will primarily house Regeneron’s pre-clinical manufacturing and process development operations. She reported that Regeneron recently applied to the Town of Greenburgh for amended land use approval on the Parcel D building.</p>
<p>Alexandra Bowie, a company spokesperson, told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the original building plan called for 128,000 square feet of mixed lab/office space.</p>
<p>In addition to the expanded size of the building and six years of inflation, the reason for the significant additional cost of the amended development project is due to its usage change to all preclinical manufacturing and process development, which requires specialized space/equipment for producing drug product.</p>
<p>Bowie said of the company’s expansion, &#8220;We’re proud that the Regeneron team continues to grow, as our research and development efforts continue to deliver new medicines for patients in need. We appreciate the support of our local communities in accommodating this growth, and ultimately helping to further this important mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a project timeline submitted to the IDA, Regeneron hopes to secure approvals from the Town of Greenburgh and necessary permits that would allow construction to begin sometime in the third or fourth quarter of this year with project completion slated for mid-2024.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting project that fits in line with the mission of the IDA and the mission of economic development here in the county,” said Westchester County IDA Chairman Joan McDonald.</p>
<p>The Westchester IDA was also given a cost benefit analysis presentation of the proposed Gateway II mixed-use project in Downtown White Plains. The project being proposed by the Alaska Permanent Fund and development partner Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC calls for the construction of 500 high-rise apartment units and 19,000 square feet of ground floor retail at the Gateway II site at 85 N. Lexington Ave. in Downtown White Plains, the current location of a long vacant 3.5-acre parking lot.</p>
<p>Michael Grella of Grella Partnership Strategies gave the cost benefit analysis presentation on the project that he said is valued at approximately $275 million.</p>
<p>He estimated the hoped-for incentives would involve approximately $640,000 in sales tax exemptions, $1.5 million in mortgage recording tax exemptions and approximately $23 million in savings to be negotiated with the City of White Plains in a Payment in Lieu of Taxes agreement.</p>
<p>The IDA Board took no action on either project at its session. Both the Regeneron and Gateway II projects are expected to be on the IDA Board’s agenda for its next meeting on May 27.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Hundreds of Realtors from across the state, including approximately 100 Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors members, met virtually with state lawmakers earlier today to discuss key issues facing the real estate industry and consumers.</p>
<p>After NYSAR cancelled last year’s Lobby Day program due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program was held virtually via Zoom. NYSAR’s program included presentations by NYSAR President David Legaz, Director of Government Affairs Mike Kelly, who detailed NYSAR’s Legislative Priorities, and an address by New York State Sen. James Skoufis (D-Newburgh-Garnerville), who has proposed a number of Fair Housing bills currently before the State Legislature.</p>
<div id="attachment_36344" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sen.-james-skoufis.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36344" class="wp-image-36344" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sen.-james-skoufis.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="258" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36344" class="wp-caption-text">New York State Sen. James Skoufis</p></div>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors virtual program included speeches by HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska, who discussed the organization’s Fair Housing initiatives and its promotion of the “American Promise,” and by Legislative Committee co-chairwoman Leah Caro.</p>
<p>The participating HGAR members then broke off into three meeting rooms with state lawmakers from the Bronx-Manhattan, Westchester-Putnam and Orange-Rockland.</p>
<p>In the Westchester-Putnam session, moderator Caro and other HGAR members engaged in a spirited give-and-take with Hudson Valley state representatives on a host of issues, including co-op transparency, the proposed extension of the eviction moratorium until Aug. 31 and “Good-Cause Evictions” legislation.</p>
<p>The session covered a recently introduced bill that would extend the state’s COVID eviction moratorium, which was set to expire on May 1, to Aug. 31. HGAR’s Caro noted that while she appreciates and feels for anyone who is struggling in this COVID economy, it is not the right time to extend the eviction moratorium now that the economy is beginning to re-open.</p>
<p>She noted that small landlords in particular would continue to suffer under the extended eviction moratorium “and that is just not the way to get back to stability.”</p>
<p>A host of state lawmakers discussed the merits and the flaws of the eviction moratorium legislation. State Sen. Shelley Mayer (D-Yonkers) said that the legislature will most likely pass the legislation in order for the state to be given sufficient time to allocate more than $2 billion in housing relief, most of which will go to landlords.</p>
<p>“I think that the real estate industry and others agree that some extension is warranted,” she said. “I think there is dissatisfaction with the length of this (proposal) but it is really based on our desire to get this large amount of federal money out the door to have meaning.”</p>
<p>Sen. Mayer, and Assembly members Steven Otis (D-Port Chester) and Sandy Galef (D-Ossining) expect the measure to pass the State Legislature in the next few days.</p>
<p>A host of Hudson Valley lawmakers pledged their opposition to the Good Cause Eviction bill and support for co-op and fair housing-oriented transparency legislation.</p>
<div id="attachment_36342" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/leah-caro.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36342" class="wp-image-36342" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/leah-caro.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="229" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36342" class="wp-caption-text">Committee co-chairwoman Leah Caro</p></div>
<p>HGAR strongly opposes legislation currently pending in the Assembly and Senate that the board says would establish an onerous and overly restrictive “good cause eviction” standard and impose de facto rent control statewide without any home rule option. This bill essentially provides tenants with a perpetual lease even when terms of that lease have expired, which is simply impractical. The legislation’s overly restrictive “good cause” standard would stifle investment in rental housing and reduce the market value of these properties.</p>
<p>The HGAR Public Policies Agenda also includes its strong opposition to legislation that would increase the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s oversight of wetlands from the current threshold of 12.4 acres or more to wetlands as small as one acre.</p>
<p>HGAR also supports COVID rent relief, noting that it is critical that New York provide relief to tenants who are unable to pay their rent due to impact of the pandemic. “It is equally important to provide relief to building owners who are struggling to pay their mortgage and property taxes as a result of non-payment of rents. In order to promote economic recovery and housing stability, HGAR supports measures to provide additional state funding and resources to the COVID-19 Rent Relief Program and the utilization of federal funding to provide direct relief to building owners hurt by nonpayment of rent or reduction in rental income due to COVID-19.”</p>
<p>HGAR also opposes a bill that would impose an additional 20% real estate transfer tax on residential properties sold in New York City within one year and a 15% transfer tax on residential properties sold after one year but less than two years from the prior purchase or conveyance.</p>
<p>The organization also opposes any expansion of cease and desist zones and a proposal in the State Assembly that would result in the removal of independent contractor status from licensed real estate brokers and salespersons.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As of early May 2021, nearly 48% of all New York State adult residents have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Nearly 36% have been fully vaccinated. Business doors are opening and there seems to be light at the end of this long COVID tunnel. While the rules are starting to loosen up, it’s important to remember that there are still regulations that are still in place relating to COVID-19 protocols that all Realtors must still follow.</p>
<p>These rules, established by the Phase 2 rollout have not changed, even though New York State has advanced to subsequent phases. Failure to comply with these rules could result in Code of Ethics violations, Department of State violations, as well as charges being brought against you and your broker by the New York State Office of the Attorney General, and/or local authorities or police. Because of all the positive changes that have recently taken place, I’ve received a lot of inquiries about the current state of the rules relating to COVID-19. So, this month&#8217;s article is simply a quick refresher for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>No Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>Under the present State of Emergency, which was extended to May 25, 2021, real estate agents cannot cold call unless they have an established relationship with the call recipient. This means that Realtors may not call expired listings or FSBOs to solicit the listing. Realtors may only contact FSBOs if they have a potential buyer. Other types of marketing are still permissible (mailers, billboards, social media, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>No Door-to-Door Solicitations</strong></p>
<p>According to Phase 2 rules, whenever possible, and to the greatest extent possible, all real estate activities are to be conducted remotely with consumers. This rule has not changed. According to the New York State Association of Realtors, this means that Realtors should not be knocking on doors to solicit business or meeting face-to-face with consumers unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Six Feet Apart</strong></p>
<p>Nothing more needs to be said. Keep six feet between you and the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Use of PPE and COVID Forms</strong></p>
<p>Effective May 19, 2021, those that are fully vaccinated will not be required to wear masks outdoors (with limited exceptions). However, you must wear a mask indoors when working with consumers. Phase 2 rules still require that all parties at a showing wear masks. It is strongly recommended that all agents carry extra masks, cleaning products and hand sanitizer. Additionally, if the homeowner requires the execution of COVID forms, they must be filled out and provided. Failure to satisfy the homeowner’s showing requirements or to have parties enter a property without a mask is a violation of the Code of Ethics as well as a direct violation of the Phase 2 requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Showings</strong></p>
<p>You can only show properties that are unoccupied (no one is inside) or are vacant (no one presently lives there). Further, the number of parties (people of different households) must be limited to those necessary for decision-making purposes. For an open house, only one party at a time (along with the agent) is permitted inside the property and showings should be staggered to avoid crowding. Children and the elderly are strongly encouraged not to participate in showings.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning/Disinfecting:</strong> All high-touch surfaces must be cleaned/disinfected by the agent before and after every showing.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantining</strong></p>
<p>As of April 10, 2021, while the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) still recommends quarantining, asymptomatic travelers are not required to test or quarantine. However, all travelers who have been out of the state for more than 24 hours (except those who traveled to contiguous states) must still fill out a New York Traveler Health Form for contact tracing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Aside from violating the Code of Ethics (not acting in the best interest of your client, not treating all parties fairly, failing to follow homeowners showing instructions, improperly accessing a property, making misrepresentations relating to a property or transaction, failing to cooperate with other Realtors) or violating the OneKey Rules and Procedures (failing to follow showing instructions, improperly accessing a property), if the Department of State Licensing division were to become involved, and all it takes is a simple phone call, an agent could potentially risk not only his license, but also the license of his/her broker, as the broker is required to supervise the licensee.</p>
<p>Further, failing to comply with the cold call moratorium, failing to follow simple PPE requirements, failing to clean/disinfect, or having too many people gathering for a showing could be reported to the New York State Office of the Attorney General and legal action could ensue and fines could be levied as well. However, worst of all is the fact that if anyone were to contract COVID-19 due to simple inaction or negligence, whether it’s you, a client, a parent, a grandparent, or a child, you will forever be saddled with the knowledge that your desire for financial gain, and your cavalier and callous actions were to blame. Don’t let that happen.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s light at the end of the COVID tunnel, and no, it’s not an oncoming train. That warm summer light will be here soon enough, we just need to be patient. In the meantime, follow the rules, take precautions, and wear a mask.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On May 4, 2021, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2RIW8bq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2RIW8bq</a>) extending the statewide ban on certain residential and commercial evictions and foreclosures in New York. The bill extends the COVID-19 Emergency Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2020 and the COVID-19 Emergency Protect Our Small Businesses Act. The legislation extends protections prohibiting residential and commercial evictions, foreclosure proceedings and credit discrimination and negative credit reporting related to the COVID-19 pandemic until Aug. 31, 2021.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, New York State Senator Brian Kavanagh, cited the findings of the Center for Disease Control that these moratoriums help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus because they provide individuals with a stable place to live. Similarly, President Trump and the CDC had also put in place nationwide bans on evictions. However, on May 5, 2021, a federal judge struck down the CDC’s Order extending the nationwide ban on evictions. The Federal District Court decision would not affect the validity of the New York State ban.</p>
<p><strong>Foreclosures and Evictions Banned Until August 31st</strong></p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo first announced a statewide moratorium on residential and commercial evictions last year on March 20th, to ensure that no tenant would be evicted during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The governor signed the Tenant Safe Harbor Act on June 30, 2020 which became effective immediately, as well as additional legislation providing financial assistance to residential renters and landlords. There were also numerous Executive Orders that are still in effect, which prohibited charges or fees for late rent payments. In addition, tenants facing financial hardship are still able to use their security deposit to pay rent and then have the right to replenish the security deposit over time. Below are the main highlights of the eviction and foreclosure moratorium legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Residential Evictions</strong></p>
<p>A residential eviction moratorium is in place until August 31st for any tenant who has suffered a COVID-related hardship. Tenants must submit a hardship declaration, or a document explaining the source of the hardship, to prevent evictions. A form of the declaration may be found on the New York courts’ website (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2R6xIsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2R6xIsf</a>). The legislation does allow landlords to evict tenants in limited circumstances such as “…tenants that are creating safety or health hazards for other tenants, and those tenants who do not submit hardship declarations.” While the tenants are required to fill out the hardship declaration form, according to the governor’s office, “…they are not required to submit proof that they are unable to pay.” These hardship declarations are signed under penalty of perjury.</p>
<p><strong>Residential Foreclosure Proceedings</strong></p>
<p>Residential foreclosure proceedings are also prohibited until Aug. 31, 2021. According to the governor’s office, “Homeowners and small landlords who own 10 or fewer residential dwellings can file hardship declarations with their mortgage lender, other foreclosing party or a court that would prevent a foreclosure.” Again, while hardship declarations are required, proof of inability to pay is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Evictions</strong></p>
<p>The legislation also prohibits the filing of eviction proceedings against commercial tenants that have suffered a “COVID-related hardship” until Aug. 31, 2021. The moratorium applies to small businesses having less than 50 employees. The small businesses must demonstrate that they are suffering a financial hardship. Again, such commercial tenants “…must submit a hardship declaration, or a document explaining the source of the hardship, to prevent evictions.”</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Foreclosure Proceedings</strong></p>
<p>During the moratorium, all commercial foreclosure proceedings are also prohibited from being filed through Aug. 31, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Lien Sales</strong></p>
<p>Local governments are prohibited from initiating a tax lien sale or a tax foreclosure until at least Aug. 31, 2021. Property owners, however, are still required to make payments when due.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Discrimination and Negative Credit Reporting</strong></p>
<p>Lending institutions are not permitted to discriminate against an owner who is seeking a loan or submitting a credit application where such an owner “…has been granted a stay of mortgage foreclosure proceedings, tax foreclosure proceedings or tax lien sales.” Further, lenders are not permitted to engage in negative credit reporting involving any creditor until August 31st. Lenders are also prohibited from discriminating against any owner who owes money and has filed a hardship declaration.</p>
<p><strong>Lawsuit Filed to Overturn Extended Eviction Moratorium</strong></p>
<p>On May 6, 2021, the Rent Stabilization Association filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the legislation extending the moratorium to August 31st. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the ban on evictions and foreclosures.</p>
<p><strong>The CDC Order Extending Nationwide Ban on Evictions To June 30th is Vacated by Federal District Judge</strong></p>
<p>On May 5th, a day after Gov. Cuomo signed legislation imposing the ban on foreclosures and evictions in New York, U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in her decision in <em>Alabama Association of Realtors, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3tttCaF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3tttCaF</a>) vacated the CDC’s order banning evictions. Under the original CARES Act enacted in March 2020, a nationwide 120-day eviction moratorium was first put in place. This 120-day eviction moratorium applied only to rental properties that participated in federal assistance programs or were subject to federally-backed loans.</p>
<p>President Trump then issued an Executive Order directing the CDC to “…consider whether any measures temporarily halting residential evictions of any tenants for failure to pay rent are reasonably necessary to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 from one state or possession into any other state or possession.” The CDC, which was delegated the authority to do so by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, ultimately issued an order banning residential evictions based on health and safety concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. The order was extended several times and was now set to expire on June 30th.</p>
<p>Judge Friedrich in vacating the CDC’s order explained that although, according to HHS, Congress granted the Secretary of HHS the ‘“broad authority to make and enforce’ any regulations that ‘in his judgment are necessary to prevent the spread of disease,’” this broad language does not expressly provide the Secretary, or in this case, the Director, with the authority to implement and extend moratoriums. Judge Friedrich explained that “An overly expansive reading of the statute that extends a nearly unlimited grant of legislative power to the Secretary would raise serious constitutional concerns, as other courts have found.” Therefore, neither the Secretary, nor the Director, had the authority to extend the moratorium. Ultimately, it would be up to Congress to do so as it had done previously when it extended the previous moratorium to Dec. 31, 2020, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act.</p>
<p><strong>HHS Files Emergency Order to Stay District Court Order</strong></p>
<p>On May 6, 2021, HHS filed an emergency motion to stay the order issued by Judge Friedrich pending an appeal. Judge Friedrich granted a temporary administrative stay and provided the plaintiffs until May 12th to respond to HHS’s motion. HHS would then have four days from the filing of the plaintiffs’ response to reply. Thereafter, Judge Friedrich would rule quickly to determine whether to grant a stay or simply affirm her prior decision to vacate the CDC Order.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: CFPB New Interim Rule</strong></p>
<p>On May 3, 2021l, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission issued a press release announcing a new CFPB rule dealing with debt collection practices and the protection of individuals who have been affected by the pandemic. The CFPB and FTC announced that letters were sent to large landlords nationwide putting them on notice about the “…federal protections in place to keep tenants in their homes and stop the spread of COVID-19.” A copy of a sample letter that was sent to landlords can be viewed at <a href="https://bit.ly/3vWaWCm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3vWaWCm</a>.</p>
<p>The CFPB announced the issuance of an Interim Final Rule that would be effective as of May 3rd. The Interim Rule establishes new notice requirements under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The Interim Rule requires debt collectors, including attorneys, to provide written notice to tenants who may have rights under the CDC moratorium and prohibits them from misrepresenting tenants’ ineligibility for protection from eviction under the CDC moratorium. However, if the CDC’s moratorium is vacated, then CFPB’s Interim Rule may not apply until the moratorium is specifically extended by Congress and kept in place.</p>
<p>CFPB Acting Director Dave Uejio states in the release, “Landlords should ensure that FDCPA-covered debt collectors working on their behalf, which may include attorneys, notify tenants of their rights under federal law. Nearly nine million households are at risk of eviction due to the economic effects of COVID-19, but no one should lose their home without understanding their rights… [and] [w]e will hold accountable debt collectors who move forward with illegal evictions.”</p>
<p><strong>Frequent Developments: Stay Informed</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that the state of the law is changing on a daily basis and it is extremely difficult to keep up with the frequent developments. As real estate agents, it is imperative to stay informed so that you are able to provide your client with the necessary information. Real estate professionals who represent tenants and landlords need to provide as much information to their clients as possible. During the past year, the legal and regulatory landscape has changed substantially and it is critical for agents and other real estate professionals to seek assistance and guidance relating the new laws and requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only changed the way we do business, it has changed the legal framework within which we operate, and one must keep up with the fast-paced changes.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At the federal level Realtors have won a huge victory. The CDC moratorium on evictions, which has caused people to avoid paying rent, has been struck down. The decision does not affect the moratorium in New York State. This will still go through the appeals process, but for now it is the beginning of a string of victories.</p>
<p>The moratorium was ruled unconstitutional since it was not done legislatively, and because the CDC has no role in regulating housing. Since we are no longer under emergency rule, the moratorium is not necessary. We have no mass lockdowns currently. Additionally, $50 billion in aid was passed to help landlords and keep tenants in their homes. In New York, distribution of the aid will be administered by the state.</p>
<p>At the state level we had our first virtual Realtor lobby day. It was a tremendous success. Our top priority was to stop a bill with the misnomer “Good Cause Eviction.” This would make it nearly impossible to evict a tenant for non-payment of rent or for most other violations. It would also take away the landlord’s right to set the terms of the lease. Realtors also pressed their Senators and Assembly members for landlords to be able to apply for relief directly instead of through a tenant who does not intend to apply for it or does not know how to apply for it. We also urged our legislators to not pass an independent contractor’s status bill that could take away a licensee’s classification status and make them employees. This would have devastating effects for our industry. We also signaled our support and urged the Assembly to pass the Senate fair housing package. This will help root out discrimination in real estate transactions.</p>
<p>Finally, on a local level we have moved ever closer to passing co-op transparency legislation in the Westchester County Board of Legislators. This would require co-op boards to provide a reason in writing stating why they are denying a potential applicant. Make sure you respond to the call for action that was sent out again this month. A public hearing for the co-op bill has been scheduled for May 24th at 7:30 p.m. and can be viewed online. Stay tuned for updates on these issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A transformation is taking place in the City of Yonkers that is radically changing its public/affordable housing stock. Under the guidance of the administration of Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano and the president and CEO of the Municipal Housing Authority for the City of Yonkers Wilson Kimball, nearly three quarters of a billion dollars is being spent to reimagine what it is like to live in subsidized/affordable housing in this city.</p>
<p>In this month’s Five Questions With feature, Kimball discusses MHACY’s initiatives to reimagine public housing by undertaking new construction, massive renovations to existing housing stock and introducing green elements that takes the city’s public housing “out of the dark ages” and transforms the properties into vibrant communities that fit into the new development taking place in the city.</p>
<p>Kimball was appointed MHACY President and CEO in April 2020 after serving as Commissioner of Planning and Development for the City of Yonkers since 2013. Kimball succeeded Joseph Shuldiner who retired after having served as MHACY Executive Director for the past 13 years.</p>
<p>Under her leadership as Commissioner of Planning, the city has benefitted from more than $4 billion in private investment, more than 10,000 renovated, rehabbed or new apartments including more than 3,000 affordable units and more than 500 new hotel rooms. Yonkers has also won 26 grants valued at more than $20.7 million for crucial capital projects such as the Saw Mill River Daylighting Phase 1, 2 and 3, the Ashburton Avenue corridor and Putnam Rail Trail. Prior to her tenure as Yonkers Planning Commissioner, she served as Senior Vice President of Operations for the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority in New York City.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DSC_0021-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-36660" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DSC_0021-1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /></a>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The ongoing Municipal Housing Authority’s Rental Assistance Demonstration or RAD Program has rehabilitated approximately 1,700 housing units throughout the city. Through this more than $500-milllion program and others is the authority and the City of Yonkers looking to change what has been the stereotypical substandard public housing apartment in a crime-ridden area into an attractive modern residence located in a vibrant sustainable community?</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> The short answer of course is Yes. The number of units is approximately 1,762 and the actual total for the RAD conversion of all of those units is more than $744 million. So, that’s a lot of money and that kind of investment—three quarters of a billion dollars—absolutely (signifies) our intention to turn the image of public housing around and make it fit into the community as the City of Yonkers is developing and has developed over the past nine years of Mayor (Mike) Spano’s leadership and into a more vibrant community and out of the dark ages when renovations weren’t done and units were abandoned. We had a whole floor at Palisades Towers, which was formerly known as Schlobohm at Schroder Street where the Municipal Housing Authority had an office but they abandoned it in the 1980s or early 1990s and it was a whole floor of apartments and office space that was just abandoned. So, the renovations at Palisades (Towers) converted them from an abandoned office to housing and brought more affordable housing online. So, that is definitely our intention.</p>
<p>I think (the housing authority’s capital investment and programs to change affordable housing) provides a sense of place that is better and tells people that live in that housing that you are not forgotten and this is not some throw-away housing of last resort, that we value you and value your family. We value you if you are a senior and have lived your whole life in Yonkers. I think people have a misconception of public housing or now we call it affordable housing, people have a misconception that I think was driven by images in the 80s, in my opinion, of a welfare cheat mother with a lot of children and they were sort of milking the system. That is 100% inaccurate, but exactly what people think. Sixty percent of our (MHACY) population is Hispanic, all of them have jobs. Every last tenant has some kind of job. Mostly, they are underemployed and some of our seniors are pensioners. They were 456 Teamsters or whatever, and they did an honest job for an honest living their whole lives and this is now where they live.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Last year, MHACY continued work on the $236-million transformation of Cottage Gardens and closed on the financing of 178 Warburton at The Ridgeway, a new $56-million mixed-income residential complex being developed by MHACY and The Community Builders. That project is the fifth of six phases of this initiative that will eventually improve 500 units of housing. Can you give us an update on the sixth and final phase and why is the Cottage Gardens project so important to the authority and the city?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20190411_124302-1024x768-e1621371277186.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-36642" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20190411_124302-1024x768-e1621371277186.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="240" /></a>Kimball:</strong> The terms of the sixth phase of Cottage Gardens is currently under negotiation with MHACY and Community Builders, which is the developer that has done all of the other phases. It has been slated to be 92 units. We are in the very, very beginning stages of negotiating that relationship. In fact, just now we are scheduling appointments to talk to the architects who responded to the RFP for that project… So, it is moving along and the 172 Warburton (project), which was phase four is having a lottery on June 1, so that building is coming online and the lottery will give preference to former residents of Cottage Gardens and our other properties, like (Ross F.) Calcagno (Homes), that are currently under construction through the RAD program. With the fifth phase, we are working on the outdoor space that the county gave us HIF money for and so that is all coming together this summer. That fifth phase has really been a New York State, Westchester County, City of Yonkers, MHACY and the Community Builders partnership to get that all together because there has been money from all of those sources. And that is what we always point to as the best of public-private partnerships.</p>
<p>Why is it (Cottage Gardens) so important? That whole development has really redefined Warburton Avenue and the structure and the beauty of that whole neighborhood. So many of those properties overlook the Hudson River and it’s been a monumental change in the entrance and exit as you go into certain neighborhoods using Warburton as a north-south corridor or Ashburton Avenue as an east-west corridor. You really see the change and the vitality of those new buildings. And it’s funny because the City of Yonkers did drone footage for us of the whole neighborhood and how it has changed and one of our development partners was watching it and said, “Oh, this is the Community Builders project, that’s our Cottage Place replacement”… and gave a whole beautiful speech about it, but it actually turned out that they were pointing to the Avalon Bay apartments and they had gotten confused because the Avalon Bay apartments and our apartments are indistinguishable, except Avalon Bay is right on the water. But, that is how nice those buildings look. I mean, to be mistaken for Avalon Bay I think is somewhat of a credit to the amount of effort TCB (The Community Builders) has put into making these units look more modern. They have a lot of more modern amenities, like day care centers and education space and that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Last year, the authority renovated a total of 1,336 affordable housing units and had 425 additional units under construction. Is there a shortage of affordable housing in the city and how many new units are you hoping to add in 2021? Also, the city is looking to partner with landlords on Section 8 housing. Please explain?</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> So, the short answer again on whether there is a shortage of affordable housing is Yes. We believe there is a shortage of affordable housing in the city. The county did a study in November 2019 that found the county as a whole was short about 11,000 units of affordable housing and if you talk to Norma Drummond, who is the Planning Commissioner for Westchester County, she will tell you most of the prospective residents of affordable housing want to live in the lower county cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle. So, we definitely have a shortage and we are hoping to bring on probably a couple of hundred units in 2021 through renovation or building new, so that would be TCB or our own RAD conversions…</p>
<p>So, one of the ways we are looking at to grow is through providing Section 8 vouchers to private developers and through that end we issued an RFP and we are going to issue another RFP and so far, we have been very happy with the results. We have worked with groups like Westhab, Conifer and Trinity who are looking at projects in different areas. Westhab has projects in the Nodine Hill area, like Elm Street. Conifer has a project where they are building three separate buildings on Ravine and Point streets and Trinity is looking on McLean Avenue. So, we are really happy about the diversity of sectors we are dealing with and the fact that we are dealing with multiple developers because it is never good to put all your eggs in one basket. And we are hoping that more private developers will come forward to work with us. Also, we are looking at property that is city surplus. I also just got out of a meeting with a community leader about developing a home ownership program. So, we have a lot of exciting things happening, so we just need to get the time and the days and the resources to pull it all together…</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> MHACY has embraced the concept of green technology to create efficiencies and cost savings. One of the avenues the authority is considering is Passive House for example. Can you detail MHACY’s efforts in the green arena?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cottage-Gardens-cropped.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-36638" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cottage-Gardens-cropped.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="379" /></a>Kimball:</strong> We are working with Groundwork Hudson Valley. First, we paid for them to do a feasibility study of our properties and that was on issues such as rainwater runoff, bioswales, local non-evasive plantings and different ways to address different issues at each property. So, for instance at Calcagno and Palisade Tower where there are big parking lots, we see a high temperature, so it is a ‘heat island effect’ and we are talking to Groundwork about doing everything like from painting the roofs white to adding tree cover so we would have a tree canopy to bring down the heat because there are a number of studies that indicate that people who live in affordable housing and are subjected to high temperature levels have harder issues learning, higher rates of asthma, and that kind of thing. So, we are working with them on those properties with certain specific things, whereas at (Kris) Kristensen (Homes), which is in the Hollow, we have flooding problems, so we are trying to mitigate the flooding and at (Joseph F.) Loehr Court we have some runoff issues so we are going to look at bioswales. In all cases, we are working with Groundwork and I was very specific that we want local plants that are easy to maintain by our staff, that are non-invasive and that don’t provide homes for unwanted pests…</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Kimball discussed a host of other initiatives at other properties including the introduction of community gardens, and other means where residents can have more of a varied green space, rather than just existing grass and concrete.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In that vein, recently, the City of Yonkers, Robert Martin Co., G&amp;S Solar, Community Solar, MHACY and others announced a major solar initiative. Can you explain MHACY’s involvement and how it could benefit tenants?</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> We signed up to be a partner agency with Sustainable Westchester, Groundwork Hudson Valley and Robert Martin. Robert Martin puts the solar panels on their roofs and then they sell it back to the grid and allow low-income or affordable housing tenants to utilize savings from that production of energy. So, it can drop your energy bill by 10 cents (per kilowatt hour) to $1 every month. What a lot of people don’t understand is that some tenants in affordable housing, and certainly in our affordable housing, pay their own electric and gas. We have 100 residents who are seniors in Martinelli (Manor) and (Msgr. Cajetan J.) Troy (Manor) who pay their own electric and we have over 200 residents that live in what we call our seven townhouse developments that pay their own electric and gas and this would help those individuals achieve savings. And in many cases, they are seniors who are on a fixed income.</p>
<p>Last summer, when it was hot and there was COVID, people couldn’t go to cooling centers and in fact, many tenants were stuck at home with air conditioning and for people who are on fixed income and are trying to figure out how to save $1 or $5, this is really important to them, not to mention it is the right thing to do for the environment.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A host of prominent Westchester County Realtors testified in favor of a long sought-after co-op disclosure bill last night during a virtual public hearing before the Westchester County Board of Legislators.</p>
<p>The amendments to current county law would require that co-op boards provide a reason for the denial of an application when the co-op board notifies the county&#8217;s Human Rights Commission of a denial. The measure would also require disclosure of minimum financial requirements to applicants before they apply. The County Board of Legislators could hold a vote on whether to approve the bill in a few weeks, according to Philip Weiden, government affairs director for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>Among the many HGAR officials and members that testified before the County Board of Legislators included: HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska, HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty, HGAR President-elect Anthony Domathoti, HGAR Treasurer Carmen Bauman, Legislative Committee Co-Chair Leah Caro, Barry Kramer, John Crittenden, Ray Hollingsworth Falu, Dorothy Botsoe, Jean Tickell, Mary Kingsley, Jerome Jeffrey, J. Philip Faranda, Gary Leogrande and Nick Wolff.</p>
<p>Representatives of co-op management, including members of the Building and Realty Institute, testified against the bill, charging that the measure is unnecessary and would result in increased litigation and insurance costs.</p>
<p>Weiden, who also testified at the session, shot down those claims, noting that in Suffolk County, the Village of Hempstead and Rockland County, where co-op disclosure legislation have been enacted, have not seen marked increases in lawsuits or cooperative insurance costs. He also noted that since Westchester passed legislation in 2018 requiring co-op Boards adhere to a time frame to respond to purchase applications, more than 500 co-op application denials have been referred to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Caro noted that under current law, a co-op board is not required to inform a shareholder in the cooperative (the seller) the reason for its denial of a purchase application. She later told legislators, “You will likely hear from (co-op) Board members that they do not discriminate. That’s great. Then I argue what is the downside of providing a written reason?”</p>
<p>“As someone who has owned and lived in co-ops for the past 30 years and who has served on co-op Boards, including the position of President of a co-op Board, I fully support the proposed legislation and I applaud the efforts of the Westchester County Board of Legislators to bring about meaningful change to the co-op purchase process,” Haggerty testified. “Change can be difficult, but in this case, change is imperative.”:</p>
<p>A host of HGAR leaders and Westchester Realtors testified of cases where prospective co-op applicants were denied by co-op Boards despite strong credit and financial backgrounds.</p>
<p>“This bill at its heart speaks against inequity, discrimination and to fight back against discrimination in housing,” Domathoti said. “I believe this bill creates a tremendous opportunity to make an important stand for fairness in the co-op purchase and sale markets.”</p>
<p>He added, “To be clear, housing discrimination is abhorrent and has no place in Westchester. Co-ops still have the right to reject unqualified buyers, but some basic level of transparency and predictability in the process should be part of the mix.”</p>
<p>Former HGAR President Kramer, who has been a staunch advocate for cooperative transparency legislation in Westchester and in New York State, said the bill signed into law in December 2018 by Westchester County Executive George Latimer was a “good first step.”</p>
<p>“Now is the time to take this even further and make bold and meaningful changes to the way co-ops are sold,” he testified. “I’ve seen the heartbreak when someone is rejected by a co-op Board with no reason given.”</p>
<p>Noting that there have been more than 500 rejections sent to the county’s Human Rights Commission since 2018, the building and cooperative industry’s claim that there was no need for further regulation was simply not true, he said.</p>
<p>Kramer later added, “If co-op rejections occur mainly for financial reasons, then why are co-op Boards so afraid to share this information?”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Westchester County co-op transparency bill has finally had a public hearing. The number of speakers who came out in support of the bill outnumbered the naysayers by a 3 to 1 margin.</p>
<p>The arguments against the bill were ones we had heard many times before and easily disputed. Opponents said that the bill, if passed, would raise insurance premiums. This has not occurred in Suffolk County, the Village of Hempstead or Nassau County where these bills have been law for years. There has not been a drop off of participants willing to serve on co-op boards, as opponents have claimed will happen if the bill passes. There have been no documented lawsuits in the counties with co-op legislation as claimed by the bill’s opponents. Westchester County Executive George Latimer has pledged to sign this bill, and we are cautiously optimistic that it will pass the legislature.</p>
<p>On the state level, co-op discussions have continued to move along. It is unlikely that any bill will be passed this year. Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the automatic acceptance mandate if the board does not give an answer in the required time frame.</p>
<p>Also, on the state level, more than $2 billion in assistance is set to begin for landlords. They must submit applications to receive the aid and the process appears to be cumbersome and has not yet been fully vetted.</p>
<p>On the federal level, we continue to push for the full repeal of the SALT cap. Congressional members from the tri state area have said they want this as part of any infrastructure bill. We also continue to educate members of Congress on the importance of 1031 like kind exchanges. This is critical to the success of commercial real estate markets. We will keep you updated on these issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>POUGHKEEPSIE—An ongoing study on the costs of improvements to Route 17, including the possible construction of a third lane in both the eastbound and westbound directions could cost anywhere from as little as $245 million to as much as $1 billion, depending upon the scope of the project.</p>
<p>Members of the New York State Department of Transportation’s Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group hosted a virtual workshop on Thursday, June 3 to provide the public an update on the study’s progress and improvements being considered for the vital section of roadway in Orange and Sullivan counties. The program was hosted by Mark Tiano, PE, NYSDOT Project Manager for the Route 17 PEL study, and also featured officials with consulting firm WSP USA that covered a host of topics including the estimated cost of various third lane build scenarios under consideration; possible transit enhancements, including the construction of new park and ride facilities, and a host of interchange improvements in Sullivan and Orange counties that could be undertaken if and when funding is available.</p>
<p>Rebecca Novak, civil department manager at WSP USA’s office in Valhalla, detailed the two major third lane build options. If the study recommends the construction of a third lane, the least expensive option would add a third lane in the existing roadway footprint for a stretch of 20 miles from the I-87 connector in Harriman to the Route 211 exit (Exit 120) that would cost an estimated $245 million to $315 million. To broaden the scope of the project to run a stretch of 45 miles extending the third lane to Route 17B (Exit 104) in Monticello would raise the cost of that option to between $550 million to $710 million. This option would have low to moderate impacts on existing bridges, minor environmental impacts and moderate pavement needs, but would also have non-standard left shoulders for the full length of the respective third lane expansions.</p>
<p>Novak explained that a second option would involve widening the existing roadway to accommodate the third lane expansions in both directions. The estimated cost of this option for a third lane covering 20 miles from Southern Orange County to Middletown would run between $350 million to $450 million. The project cost for the 45-mile stretch from Southern Orange County to Monticello would run between $790 million to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Under this option, it is believed the impact to existing bridges would be moderate, would involve minor pavement maintenance needs and would only have left shoulders at existing bridge piers termed as non-standard. She noted that the environmental impacts of this more expansive third lane scenario would be moderate.</p>
<p>The study group has not made any decisions on third lane build option preference. The group has also considered no-build as well as the construction of a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane and infrastructure upgrades as options. The study group has ruled out the No Build option, while it believes that the HOV would accomplish some of the project goals and that upgrades to interchanges would fall in line with the project’s goals and objectives.</p>
<p>It should be noted that supporters for the addition of a third lane on Route 17, including the 17-Forward 86 coalition, have estimated the cost at approximately $500 million. Project advocates have expressed hope that the project could be funded under the massive infrastructure bill being discussed in Washington, DC between the Biden administration and Democratic and Republican members of Congress.</p>
<p>The presentation also included traffic data from 2018 which showed significant traffic issues mainly by the Harriman, Central Valley and Monroe exits as well as in Goshen and Middletown. Several participants noted that the traffic data for an average Friday evening needs to be updated due to a host of issues, including the impending opening of LEGOLAND New York as well as the influx of new residents to Sullivan County by New York City residents fleeing the city during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Route-17-project-costs-copy-e1622819503320.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36824 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Route-17-project-costs-copy-e1622819503320.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="202" /></a>Katie Craig, PE, PTOE, traffic engineering &amp; ITS Manager at WSP USA, in projecting the roadway’s needs by 2055, said, “So, overall the picture we are trying to paint here for you is that what we see during this Friday evening time period in 2055 is that most of Orange County is really going to be operating under Level of Service F and stop-and-go conditions, with small pockets of stable (traffic flow), but mainly stop-and-go conditions.”</p>
<p>Marc Baez, director of economic development for Sullivan County, noted that the DOT figures were compiled from May and noted that every June and for the rest of the summer the population of the county increases sharply from approximately 78,000 to well in excess of 300,000.</p>
<p>Bill Gorton, senior manager for transportation services for WSP USA, said that the traffic data will be updated prior to the release of the draft study in September. Gorton is a former Director of Region 8 (Hudson Valley) for the New York State Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>Baez, who is co-chair of the 17-Forward-86 Coalition., said of the workshop, “It is encouraging that efforts to widen the Route 17 corridor are moving forward and the PEL study is a critical step in this process. The message from Washington is that infrastructure investment is a priority, with a focus on transformative projects that have significant local support. The Route 17 improvements are consistent with those objectives. This is an opportunity for us all to focus on safety and sustainability, as we strive to continue to ensure economic prosperity for our region.”</p>
<p>17-Forward-86 was established in August 2018 by a dedicated group of advocates who support the widening of Route 17. The coalition comprises more than 200 members of economic development groups, construction trades, tourism groups and energy companies who share a common vision for expanding the capacity of Route 17 to strengthen the economic well-being of the Hudson Valley and Sullivan Catskills.</p>
<p>The June 3rd workshop was the second of a planned three public workshops. The Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group will be working on a draft scoping report that will be released at its next public workshop scheduled for Sept. 14. The group hopes to close out the study by the end of October 2021.</p>
<p>A total of 132 community and business leaders from the Hudson Valley zoomed in March 18 for a presentation by the New York State Department of Transportation on the status of a Planning and Environment Linkages (PEL) study of the Route 17 corridor in Orange and Sullivan counties.</p>
<p>The PEL process is being initiated by the NYSDOT in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration. The DOT last year began a scoping and preliminary review process as part of the $5 million PEL study, whose funding was secured through the 2018-2019 state budget.</p>
<p>The PEL study is a follow-up to a NYSDOT study released in May 2013 that examined the corridor between Monticello, Exit 103 (Rapp Road) and Harriman, Exit 131 (New York State Thruway) to help accommodate transportation demands brought about by economic growth in the region and to help accommodate future growth.</p>
<p>The final reported recommend: adding a general use third lane, in each direction, from Interstate 87 in Harriman to just west of Middletown, Orange County; improve key interchanges in Orange and Sullivan counties; provide new and expanded park and ride lots at strategic locations in Orange and Sullivan counties and recommend some provisions for future transit.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The end of the New York State legislative session in Albany is at hand. The real estate industry was fortunate in not having several bills it strenuously opposed come up for a vote.</p>
<p>One particularly onerous bill with the misnomer “Good Cause” eviction, would have locked in a long-term lease and taken away the property owner’s ability to set the terms of the lease. It would also cap rent increases at 3% or the rate of inflation, whichever is less, regardless of increases in property taxes, fuel or any other cost increases related to the property. In essence the bill would have imposed de facto rent control across the state.</p>
<p>Another bill that will not now pass, and was a big win, is the independent contractor status bill. This bill could have potentially reclassified Realtors as employees instead of independent contractors. Luckily compromise versions of this proposal would not affect Realtors&#8217; independent contractor status.</p>
<p>A defeat for our industry on the state level has been the failure, once again, of the New York State Legislature to pass co-op reform. New York State transfer and mortgage recording taxes were also not raised. Overall, our successes lie in helping to prevent bad bills from passing.</p>
<p>On a local level we diligently continued to pursue legislation requiring co-op boards to give a reason in writing stating why someone is being denied. The Westchester County Board of Legislators recently held a public hearing and the vote on the legislation is expected later this month. County Executive George Latimer has indicated he would sign the bill if it passes the Board of Legislators. At the public hearing on the bill, supporters of the bill vastly outnumbered opponents of the legislation.</p>
<p>Under the current law more than 500 purchase rejections have occurred. This is a significantly greater number than opponents of the original bill had predicted. We also do not know how many co-op boards have complied or not complied with the current law, as the declination notification to the human rights commission is self-regulating.</p>
<p>Please call your legislators if you have not already done so and urge them to pass the Westchester co-op disclosure bill. Stay tuned for further updates on this legislation.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Currently, we are seeing an uptick in the use of “broker agency” in our MLS, and there is much confusion in its use and how it applies, so I’m going to breakdown the difference between it and “buyer agency” and the pitfalls that can occur; specifically, not getting paid cooperating compensation (Note: I will not delve in the issues of vicarious liability as it relates to representation in this article.)</p>
<p><strong>Buyer’s Agency</strong></p>
<p>We are all pretty familiar with buyer’s agency, so this will be brief. In buyer’s agency, you represent the buyer. Upon first substantive contact you must fill out an Agency Disclosure form indicating that you are acting in the buyer’s best interests. Cooperating compensation is paid through the MLS to all buyer agents and the offered compensation is placed under the prefix “BA.” It is important to note that you cannot change agency unless, after full discussion and disclosure of its impact, you inform your client of the proposed change and obtain their consent to change agency (i.e., buyer agency to dual agency, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Broker Agency</strong></p>
<p>Broker agency was around before there was buyer agency and it is currently coming back in vogue. It is most often established by a listing agent (Note: there is buyer broker agency as well, but it is rare.) when they list a property and place it on the MLS, offering broker agency cooperating compensation under the prefix “BRA.” In this relationship, the cooperating broker who brings a buyer does not have a direct relationship with the seller, who is the listing broker’s exclusive client, but they take their instructions from and communicate with the listing broker. The offer of broker agency compensation on the MLS creates the broker agency relationship with all participating members. In effect, the listing agent is saying, “Hey, brokers, work with me and my client to find a buyer.” If a cooperating agent has a potential buyer, then they can present the buyer and receive cooperating compensation as a broker’s agent…but there is a catch.</p>
<p>If there is a pre-existing relationship between the cooperating agent and the buyer (buyer agency), because the cooperating agent is now trying to act as a broker’s agent, their fiduciary duty is shifting and they are now trying to represent the interests of the seller/listing agent’s client, not the buyer. This creates a problem. In this situation, if the buyer agent wishes to switch to a broker’s agent, the cooperating agent would be required to explain the impact of this change, how the buyer is giving up his representation, and then obtain the consent of their client to change representation from buyer agent to seller agent. If authorized by their client, they would also be required to provide a new Agency Disclosure Form to the buyer indicating that they are representing the interests of the seller in this transaction and the buyer is being treated as a customer. Further conflicts may arise in that the agent may already have confidential information about the buyer, so how can that agent effectively change relationships without jeopardizing those confidences?</p>
<p>If there was no pre-existing relationship with the prospective buyer and the cooperating agent (the buyer is a customer), then the cooperating agent simply needs to provide the Agency Disclosure that they are representing the seller at first substantive contact. From there, the broker agent can introduce the buyer to the property and if a transaction is completed, they will receive broker agency compensation. It is important to note that if the cooperating agent successfully engages as a broker agent, the buyer may still engage the services of another agent to represent their interests (a buyer’s agent). However, that buyer’s agent would not receive any compensation under the MLS, as the cooperating compensation is only to broker agents not buyer agents, and the buyer’s agent would have to arrange their own compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>
<p>All agents should religiously check the compensation being offered on the MLS. Do not confuse BA compensation with BRA compensation. If you are working with a buyer as a client and a cooperating broker is offering BRA compensation on the MLS, you must make certain that if you try to switch relationships it is done before an offer is made, after full disclosure is made with the client, and they have consented, preferably in writing, to the switch. Remember: an agent may not place their interest in compensation above the interests of the client.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if an agent makes an offer on behalf of his buyer client and cooperating compensation is only being offered to broker’s agents, that agent is simply out of luck, unless they can negotiate compensation from the buyer client.</p>
<p>Another practice that helps protect the compensation of the cooperating agent is the execution of the Exclusive Right to Represent Agreement (also known as a Buyer Agency Agreement). With this agreement, the buyer agent is ensuring that they will be compensated, as these standard agreements indicate that the buyer client will compensate the agent for their work and, in turn, if there is other compensation available, the agent will offset that compensation against the amounts owed by the client, with the client consenting to dual compensation. In this fashion, the buyer’s agent can continue to represent the interests of the buyer if the compensation being offered is only broker agency compensation, there is no switching of fiduciary duties and even if the agent did overlook BRA for BA, they will still get paid.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A Realtor’s duty of reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and duty to account are the most important aspects of being a real estate agent. Consumers rely on Realtors for guidance and truth. This means that an agent’s compensation is an afterthought for those that are engaged in protecting the rights of consumers. To flip-flop on representation in an effort to make money will not play well with the Department of State or a Professional Standards panel. Realtors must take affirmative steps to ensure that they get fairly compensated for the work they perform and this means making sure what type of compensation is being offered, who they are representing, and what precautions have they taken to guarantee they will be paid.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The governor during Day 472 of the pandemic emergency, noted that New York State went from the highest positivity rate on the planet at 48.16% at the height of the pandemic last year to the lowest in the nation at 0.40% as of yesterday.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The day everyone has been waiting for since last March is finally here. Gov. Andrew Cuomo at a press conference at One World Trade Center today lifted most New York State mandated COVID restrictions effective immediately.</p>
<p>The governor during Day 472 of the pandemic emergency, noted that New York State went from the highest positivity rate on the planet at 48.16% at the height of the pandemic last year to the lowest in the nation at 0.40% as of yesterday.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s health guidance and New York Forward industry specific guidelines—including social gathering limits, capacity restrictions, social distancing, cleaning and disinfection, health screening, and contact information for tracing—are now optional for retail, food services, offices, gyms and fitness centers, amusement and family entertainment, hair salons, barber shops and personal care services, among other commercial settings.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo said he was able to lift the state COVID restrictions because the state had reached the 70% threshold of adults over the age of 18 having at least one COVID vaccination. He said the state reached the 70% mark ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: New York State Association of Realtors Director of Government Affairs Mike Kelly tells <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the ban on telemarketing by Realtors remains in effect since Gov. Cuomo has yet to end the state of emergency declaration.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated individuals continue to be responsible for wearing masks, in accordance with federal CDC guidance. The state&#8217;s health guidelines continue to be in effect for large-scale indoor event venues, pre-K to grade 12 schools, public transit, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and health care settings per CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s COVID restrictions remain in effect for large-scale indoor event venues—now defined as indoor venues that hold more than 5,000 attendees. Proof of vaccination can be used to eliminate social distancing and remove masks for fully vaccinated individuals, state officials said. Unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status individuals who are over the age of four must continue to present proof of a recent negative diagnostic COVID-19 test result and wear masks within the venue. However, social distancing can be reduced or eliminated between tested attendees, allowing venues to reach 100% capacity in all sections.</p>
<p>The governor said that New York State was “ambushed by COVID” and that during the pandemic life in New York “was like living in a science fiction movie.”</p>
<p>The governor noted that a key to the state’s success was the successful roll out of the COVID vaccines. “We&#8217;ve gone on to do more than 20 million vaccines, more per capita than any big state in the United States of America,” he said. “Congratulations to New Yorkers because they are the ones who did it. We&#8217;re no longer just surviving—we&#8217;re thriving.’</p>
<p>White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeffrey D. Zients said in a prepared statement, &#8220;In communities across New York, the deadly Coronavirus is in retreat thanks to the state&#8217;s progress on vaccinations. New York went from being one of the hardest-hit states in the country to being one of the leading states in its effort to combat the virus because of a vaccination program that made it easy and convenient for New Yorkers to get vaccinated, state and community leaders who worked hard at the local level, and millions of New Yorkers who rolled up their sleeves to get vaccinated.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>From sprawling Long Island Sound estates to stately Hudson River manors, to expansive rural retreats, the Hudson Valley is home to some of the most breathtaking luxury properties in New York and the nation. But, this time of year, when people begin to think about where to escape for the summer, inevitably, the Hamptons come to mind.</p>
<p>Part of the east end of Long Island, the popular seaside destination has been famous for its opulent mansions, couture boutiques and of course, celebrity sightings. It’s no secret that residential real estate prices in the Hamptons rank are among the highest in the country, especially now as the exodus from New York City continues.</p>
<p>The Hamptons are actually comprised of a group of villages and hamlets in the towns of Southhampton and East Hampton, located in the South Fork of Long Island. Included within these towns are communities like Westhampton, Quogue, Hampton Bays, Water Mill, Bridgehampton, Sag Harbor, Wainescott, Amagansett and Montauk, among many others.</p>
<div id="attachment_36912" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36912" class="wp-image-36912" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/35-Million-Atterbury-Estate.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-36912" class="wp-caption-text">The Atterbury Estate in Southampton, currently on the market for $35 million</p></div>
<p>The Hampton’s history as a summer playground for the wealthy dates back to the late 19th Century when the area changed from a farming community to a popular summer getaway. An 1893 <em>New York Times</em> article reported that “Society is here represented during the summer by its choicest spirits. Well-bred men and women find a congenial atmosphere, refined attractions in plenty and innumerable charms about these quaint old villages.”</p>
<p>Nikki Theissen, vice president of Partner &amp; Visitor Relations for Discover Long Island, agrees that the sentiment reflected over a century ago remains the same today. “The Hamptons are world-renowned and international travelers continue to come to visit and to purchase properties here,” she said. “It has a history of being one of those destinations known for attracting the rich and famous, as well as anyone seeking a great vacation spot.”</p>
<p>During the height of the pandemic, New York City residents flocked to the Hamptons to get away from crowded conditions—some spending more time at their second homes and others renting or buying homes. “People are definitely staying longer. Both last year and this year, they started arriving in early spring and staying until fall,” said Theissen. “Some normal part-time residents even stayed year-round.”</p>
<p>Besides being a haven for “celebrity-watching,” the Hamptons have also been well-known for their expansive beaches, thriving art communities, vineyards, award-winning restaurants, and designer boutiques. “In fact,” added Theissen, “Cooper’s Beach in Southampton is always rated one of the top 10 beaches in the world.”</p>
<p>In addition, each of the Hamptons’ quaint downtown villages offer their own unique experience for first-time or returning visitors. “It’s literally like going to a movie set,” said Theissen. And where real estate is concerned, many of the area’s palatial homes may actually look like something out of a Great Gatsby-style movie.</p>
<p>One of the most expensive homes to hit the market recently is an East Hampton property listed for $69 million with Compass. The Spanish Colonial estate named “Cima Del Mundo,” which means “top of the world,” boasts eight bedrooms, seven-and-a-half baths, five fireplaces, a three-car garage, oceanside pool, pool house and panoramic views. It sits on almost three acres of land with 400 feet of ocean frontage. Originally built in 1925, the estate was renovated in 1994.</p>
<p>On Shelter Island, an exclusive historic waterfront property was recently listed for $14.9 million. Dating back to 1750, the 23-acre property is almost 3,000 square feet, and is the only one of its kind for sale in the Hamptons. It features six bedrooms, two full baths and two half-baths, as well as a barn with original beams.</p>
<p>The pre-Revolutionary War, wood shingled colonial named &#8220;Kemah&#8221;—a Shinnecock word meaning &#8220;in the face of the wind&#8221;—spans over Great Fresh Pond on the north side and Peconic Bay on the south. &#8220;This property was vital to the Native Americans who accessed fresh drinking water on Fresh Pond,&#8221; said Penelope Moore, the listing broker with Saunders &amp; Associates in Shelter Island.</p>
<p>“Kemah” is one of the houses built by George Havens in 1698, a &#8220;newcomer&#8221; to Shelter Island. Other owners over its 271 years have included the Tuthills and the current owners, the J.D. Robb family.</p>
<div id="attachment_36909" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36909" class="wp-image-36909" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/8.9-Million-Amagansett.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-36909" class="wp-caption-text">The outside deck of a modern home in Amagansett, currently on the market for $8.9 million</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Few properties epitomize the history of the East End of Long Island amid the backdrop of American history more succinctly than Kemah does,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;When you walk through the grounds, in the barn and in the home, and then gaze out onto the water, there is a feeling that the land has witnessed countless significant events and seen great people over its nearly 300 years.”</p>
<p>Many of the original details remain intact today including the wood shingles, the grand two-story 1,600-square-foot barn built in 1886, a hand-stacked fieldstone garage built in 1918, a water tower, chicken coop, a central chimney of bricks brought from Holland originally as a ship&#8217;s ballast, and exposed beams.</p>
<p>John Wickham Tuthill, also known as &#8220;Squire Wickham&#8221;, built the stone entry wall, hand-stacked fieldstone garage, and collected countless arrowheads, which he donated to the local library.</p>
<p>J.D. Robb, a scholar, writer and composer, traveled the globe recording chants and songs of diverse indigenous people from Nepal to South America and the United States, creating a collection included with more than 25,000 items at the John Donald Robb Archive of Southwestern Music. Robb also raised a flock of about 30 sheep on the property, using vegetable and fruit pigment from their crops to dye the wool.</p>
<p>“Many of the older homes on Shelter Island have fascinating stories to go with them,” explained Moore. “Back in the old days, it was actually considered improper to walk down from the main house to the pool in a bathing suit. People used to get changed in the pool house, and then change back into their clothing after swimming to return to the main house.”</p>
<p>Some of Moore’s other Shelter Island listings include a 6,600-square-foot house set on a peninsula with beach and dock for $4.325 million and a 5,100 square foot home on Gardener’s Bay for $4.249 million. “It’s difficult to find something on Shelter Island under $1 million anymore,” she admitted.</p>
<p>From Moore’s perspective, the lure of the Hamptons also includes the area’s unique summer events like the Hamptons Classic Horse Show, East Hampton’s Author’s Night at the East Hampton Library and a wealth of food events and fundraisers. Some of the celebrities she’s spotted over the years include musician Paul McCartney, and actors Alec Baldwin, Rob Lowe and Robert Downey Jr.</p>
<p>“Shelter Island can be a little bit more low key, and lot of famous people like to stay under the radar here,” she said. Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, professional golfer Tiger Woods, comedian Louis C.K, and singer Billy Joel have been “regulars” on Shelter Island for a while.</p>
<p>“They like the fact that people will leave them alone here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>However, whether a typical Hamptons home buyer is a celebrity or not, one thing that sets them apart is the fact that almost all of their deals are in cash. “Most sellers now won’t even entertain a mortgage contingency,” said Robert Nelson, executive managing director of Brown Harris Stevens’ six Hamptons offices. “I recently had an agent who’s been in the business for a while ask me about helping her clients with a mortgage, since she hadn’t dealt with that in so long!”</p>
<p>Currently, anything listed under $2 million in the Hamptons is practically gone, with multiple offers as the norm. “The typical price range tends to be anywhere from $5 million to $10 million, and that includes a lot of new construction,” he explained. “People are looking for open floor plans, five to six bedrooms, with a very light, airy feel. Almost every home in this price range also offers a pool.”</p>
<p>In fact, noted Nelson, 10-year old homes are often considered “dated.” “I’ve actually seen tear downs of homes after 20 years, because it’s easier and less expensive for the buyers to start from scratch to get exactly what they want,” he said.</p>
<p>Nelson finds most Hamptons buyers are from the New York metro area, including international buyers who already own a residence in Manhattan. “Everyone purchasing a home is using it, and a lot more often than just the summer season,” he added. “This includes people who always thought about buying something here and then COVID was the catalyst.”</p>
<div id="attachment_36911" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36911" class="wp-image-36911" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Shelter-Island-Historic-Home.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-36911" class="wp-caption-text">“Kemah,” a historic home on Shelter Island, offered for $14.9 million</p></div>
<p>With inventory down considerably from the pre-COVID days, prices are continuing to soar. Just recently, Nelson’s agents closed two $60-million deals in East Hampton, directly on the ocean. “Sometimes it’s not even about the house—it’s about the oceanfront location,” he said. “There’s nowhere else in the greater New York area that has surf and large estates, and people are buying something they can’t replicate anywhere else within two hours.”</p>
<p>One of those $60-million deals involved the Otto Spaeth House, a mid-century modern house designed in 1955 by architects George Nelson and Gordon Chadwick. The home combines abstract elements, including a second floor viewing porch with stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. It also features a formal and informal living room, each with fireplace, plus six bedrooms, and five baths.</p>
<p>Included among Brown Harris Stevens’ ultra luxury listings currently on the market is the newly restored Atterbury Estate in Southampton, offered at $35 million. Just steps from Coopers Beach, the estate was designed in 1939 by world-renowned architect Grosvenor Atterbury, credited with works such as the Parrish Art Museum, and the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It features 14,619 square feet of living space, 11 bedrooms, 12 full bathrooms, powder rooms, a custom solarium, a four -bay garage and a separate pool house.</p>
<p>For those looking to spend a little less, they can have a 3,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, seven-bath home in Amagansett for $8.895 million. The home sits less than one block from the ocean, with expansive ocean views.</p>
<p>As for vacationers seeking to rent a home in the Hamptons this summer, Nelson indicates they’re probably out of luck. “The rental inventory is basically gone,” he said. “Since last year, people have been rented for the entire summer or even the whole year, since no one still really knows what’s going to happen as we gradually recover from COVID. I think even when we get back to normal and people return to their jobs and homes in the city, we’re going to see more Thursday escapes for three-day weekends.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—At the end of this month a familiar face in the real estate industry in Orange County and the Hudson Valley region will be retiring after more than 40 years of dedicated service.</p>
<p>HGAR Chief Operating Officer Ann Garti, who also serves as the office manager for HGAR’s Goshen office, is retiring on June 30. The affable Garti entered the real estate industry answering a blind ad in the <em>Middletown Times Herald Record</em>. She was hired as the executive officer of the then Orange County Board of Realtors, later to be renamed the Orange County Association of Realtors, in May 1980. She led the organization for 31 years and eight months, growing the organization from a few hundred members to an entity that had as many as 2,900 members and a budget that rose from $42,000 at the start of her tenure to $627,000 and a thriving MLS that had an annual budget of $1.3 million.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-36968" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/20210604_091544.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="256" />Since January 2012, after being a critical part in OCAR&#8217;s merger with the Rockland and Westchester associations, Garti has served as the COO of HGAR and has sat in her familiar seat in the Goshen office as office manager. As <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/viewpoints/gateway-perspectives-ann-garti-a-40-year-tutorial-in-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty attests in his column</strong></a>, Garti has shined as an association executive and has displayed tremendous leadership in both good and bad times.</p>
<p>The resident of Cornwall is the mother of three grown men—Mark, Andrew and Christopher. Her partner and her “biggest supporter” for 35 years Ralph Friedel, passed away in 2018. Garti has a picture taken by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> photographer John Vecchiolla of her and Ralph dancing at an HGAR function as her computer screen saver in her Goshen office.</p>
<p>She considers her mentor to be George Kohl and added Mary Gray Griffith, Lee Rickie and Dorothy Reid were some of her key supporters during her time with the Orange County Association. She also added that former WPAR CEO P. Gilbert Mercurio was her role model and she considers current HGAR CEO Haggerty as one of her closest friends.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Ann, you are retiring after more than 40 years serving the Orange County Association of Realtors, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and both organizations’ affiliated MLSs. What would you say were some of your major accomplishments?</p>
<p><strong>Garti:</strong> I think that the first thing I would have to say is the merger between the Orange County Association of Realtors and the Rockland County Board of Realtors and the Westchester-Putnam Association of Realtors (predecessor organization to the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors). I think that has enabled us to have an incredible organization that is cost-effective, while representing the best interests of the members by being able to provide a great number of services to the members and a lot of professional development for them as well.</p>
<p>Also, I think that just initially the satisfaction of growing the Orange County Association of Realtors to have been able to see a very tiny organization, grow and develop and have strategic plans for its future and to become financially a very viable organization so that we had protection in times of bad markets where we were able to maintain our services, but at the same time we did not have to raise dues to the members. Those were some of the things that I found gratifying.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What were the most difficult periods in your tenure and please explain why?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36967 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05052014-Sean-Patrick-Maloney-2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="233" />Garti:</strong> I think one of the most difficult periods, which turned out in fact to be one of the successes of the Orange County Association of Realtors, was when the Orange County Multiple Listing Service took over providing multiple listing services to Rockland County. It was contentious, there was an antitrust lawsuit filed against us for $5-million. Also, getting the technology to work for the multiple listing service because we had to convert all of the data from Rockland County and bring it into our system. I lost 15 pounds during the whole process! Ultimately, I think that everybody pretty much would agree that it was very successful and that was good for both organizations. <strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: OCAR prevailed in the anti-trust suit.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What were some of the more beneficial changes that took place in the industry over the past 40 years and is there anything no longer part of the industry that you wish could make a return? Also, do you think the role of the Realtor Association has changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>Garti:</strong> I think the part of the industry that I miss and part of it is just a function of size is that there was more trust. I think a handshake was a very significant way of doing business and I think not only the relationship between the members, but just with the public because the public has changed too in the way they want to do business or not. Products such as Errors &amp; Omissions insurance were practically unheard of practically because people were not constantly afraid of being sued, with or without cause. Those are some of the things I miss.</p>
<p>Some of the great things that have changed obviously is that the technology has just totally made the industry more efficient. The technology it goes without saying has facilitated the availability of information about properties and the speed in which it is available and the fact that our agents can work so much more productively because basically, now the public does a lot of the research before they even make any kind of decision about buying or where they will buy or any of those factors.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-36981" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/20170928_190341.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="211" />I definitely think the role of the association has changed. I think we provide a great deal more service and our endeavors in education and professional development have really expanded. And I think that more than ever our role as advocates for the industry—that is major—how we have expanded our role in terms of lobbying and trying to influence elected officials about what is important to the industry and why. Basically, I am very proud of the fact that most of the things we have advocated for are issues of private property rights, so in a sense I feel we are protecting the public as well as our own industry and our own members.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Where do you see the industry heading in the years to come and do you believe Realtors will continue to play a major role in residential and commercial real estate transactions?</p>
<p><strong>Garti:</strong> I think everybody has said this so this is not something new—this is still a people relationship kind of industry. I think that while technology has served us very well and will continue to do so and will continue to make the industry even better because of the fact that things like closings won’t take forever and it can make us more efficient in those aspects of getting financing, necessary documents, etc. It is still basically a relationship industry. Particularly in residential (transactions), I believe that selecting your home is an emotional decision. When you buy a house, when you find the house that you love, it’s really an emotional decision. So, I still see a very significant role for Realtors.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What are your plans in retirement and do you have any message you wish to convey to your HGAR colleagues and staff?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-36970" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2010_1203_installation_luncheon-131-Copy.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" />Garti:</strong> My plans in retirement, and this is no surprise to people who know me, is I want to &#8220;play in the dirt&#8221; because I love to work outside and garden and all of that good stuff and to do some traveling. Morocco has been on my bucket list for some time and so has Turkey, but Turkey isn’t happening for obvious reasons! And I do want to perfect some of my baking skills, so I will spend some time doing that. Also, some of the obvious things like having more time to read and visiting museums and the (New York) Botanical Gardens. I really enjoy that.</p>
<p>To my colleagues and staff, I want to say that I think it is very, very important to enjoy what you do every day and to always give it your best effort. I also think that having been through the pandemic, we haven’t had the opportunity for collegiality that would be the norm so as we have the opportunity to being back in the office I hope they will take advantage of knowing and caring about their co-workers. At the end of the day you have to feel like you have given it your best, it is the most wonderful form of self-satisfaction that you can have.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Recent ransomware attacks and major hacks have thrust into the spotlight the importance of businesses, including those in the real estate industry, having the necessary protocols and protections in place to protect themselves and their clients from cybercriminals. During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a substantial rise in cybercriminal activity. The recent ransomware attacks and cyber-attacks on targets such the Colonial Pipeline Co. (which runs a major East Coast fuel pipeline), JBS, S.A. (one of the world’s largest meat processors), the Washington D.C. Metro Police Department, and New York City’s Law Department, to name a few, should make businesses aware of the very real threat of such attacks and the widespread disruption they can cause.</p>
<p>The real estate industry, unfortunately, is extremely vulnerable to attack by cybercriminals because many real estate agents, attorneys, bankers, mortgage brokers, appraisers, home inspectors and others involved in a real estate transaction do not implement the cybersecurity protections necessary to protect themselves against such attacks. Many real estate agents, who are independent contractors, utilize their own personal e-mails, which leaves them, and their clients’ data and personal information vulnerable. This can cause the real estate brokers for whom the real estate agents work for to accrue liability for such data breaches.</p>
<p>In 2016 (see<em> Beware of Cyber Threats: The Importance of Implementing Data Security and Privacy Policies</em> at<a href="https://bit.ly/3ziZNxF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/3ziZNxF</a>) and again in 2018 (see Cybercrime and Ransomware Are Very Real and Costly Threats! at <a href="https://bit.ly/3ghYvue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ghYvue</a>), this column focused on the risks and threats that exist in connection with cybersecurity and data breaches. Those articles highlighted existing laws and related requirements of businesses to protect consumers from data breaches and cyber-attacks as well as best practices and insight on cybersecurity insurance coverage. Real estate brokers and agents should review these articles as they are even more relevant today in light of current events. This article will revisit these issues. It will provide an update on the FBI’s 2020 IC3 Report on Cyber Crimes (“IC3 Report”) issued in March (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2TWReIP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2TWReIP</a>). It will also highlight some of the more recent laws dealing with data protections and cybersecurity such as New York State’s SHIELD Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3g8BbjR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3g8BbjR</a>) and New York City’s pending Tenant Data Privacy Act (see <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3vaW6H0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.nyc.gov/3vaW6H0</a>).</p>
<p><strong>2020 FBI IC3 Report on Cyber Crimes</strong></p>
<p>The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) provides individuals and businesses victimized by cyber-attacks with a place to report cybercrimes. The IC3 also provides the public with invaluable information on cybercriminal activity and publishes its annual IC3 Report. In the introduction to the 2020 IC3 Report, Deputy Director of the FBI Paul Abbate points out that “In 2020, while the American public was focused on protecting our families from a global pandemic and helping others in need, cyber criminals took advantage of an opportunity to profit from our dependence on technology to go on an Internet crime spree.” It is clear that while society’s primary focus was (and still is) on the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals have been taking advantage of current conditions, targeting and exploiting individuals, as well as businesses and governmental agencies of all types and sizes.</p>
<p>IC3 reported that in 2020, it “received over 28,500 complaints related to COVID-19.” These criminals targeted the individuals and businesses which sought to receive economic assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The IC3 indicated that it “received thousands of complaints reporting emerging financial crime revolving around CARES Act stimulus funds, specifically targeting unemployment insurance, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, and Small Business Economic Injury Disaster Loans, as well as other COVID-related fraud.” These cybercriminals obtain personally identifiable information through phishing and other methods and then file false unemployment claims and submit fraudulent grant and loan applications.</p>
<p>The IC3 Report points out that in the last five years there were 2,211,396 complaints filed and more than $13 billion in total losses that were suffered by victims of cyber-attacks. In 2020 alone, there were 791,790 complaints filed with the IC3 and $4.2 billion in total losses. The number of complaints filed represented a 69% increase from 2019. In 2020, Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) and E-mail Access Compromise (EAC) attacks were among the most common and the costliest totaling $1.8 billion. BEC/EAC attacks involve sophisticated scams that target businesses and individuals performing transfers of funds. The real estate industry is specifically targeted due to the frequent use of wire transfers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where remote closings were commonly utilized. Real estate agents and real estate attorneys are particularly vulnerable because the e-mails exchanged between these parties and their clients contain critical information as to when a closing will occur, the amounts that will need to be wired and the location to which the wire transfers are to be made. A cybercriminal will wait for the opportune moment and then strike.</p>
<p>The IC3 Report further points out that in 2020 there was “an increase in the number of BEC/EAC complaints related to the use of identity theft and funds being converted to cryptocurrency.” The IC3 Report explained that victims would be forced through “Extortion, Tech Support, Romance scams” to provide a form of personal identification to cybercriminals. The criminal would then use the victim’s identification to set up a bank and use it to receive stolen funds and then transfer the funds to anonymous cryptocurrency accounts. With the popularity of cryptocurrency and the anonymity it offers, this form of cybercrime will certainly increase in the years to come. Ransomware was also on the rise in 2020.</p>
<p>IC3 received 2,474 ransomware complaints and victims suffered losses in excess of $29 million. Based on recent events, a substantial increase in incidents and losses is expected in 2021. In operating their businesses, real estate professionals have in their possession critical client information and must, to the best of their ability, safeguard that information and adhere to all legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>New York State’s Cybersecurity Law: The SHIELD Act</strong></p>
<p>In July, 2019, New York State enacted the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (the SHIELD Act). The SHIELD Act expanded the data breach notification obligations under New York law and imposed affirmative cybersecurity obligations on those entities specifically enumerated in the law. The SHIELD Act makes significant changes to existing New York law. One change now makes any business that maintains private information of New York residents subject to New York data breach obligations under the law regardless of the location of the business, even if that business is located in another state or country.</p>
<p>The SHIELD Act also broadened the definition of “private information” and expanded the notification obligations of a business in the event of a breach. In addition, the law also expanded the definition of a data breach which would trigger the notification requirements to include unauthorized “access” to private information. Previously, New York law only required a business to notify affected individuals if their private information was “acquired” in the event of a data breach.</p>
<p>Prior to the enactment of the SHIELD Act, New York law provided for minimum civil penalties of $5,000 for a violation of the notification obligations, or $10 per instance of failed notification to each affected individual, whichever was greater, up to a maximum penalty of $150,000. Under the SHIELD Act the minimum penalty is still $5,000, however, the penalty for each failed notification has been increased to $20. Additionally, the maximum penalty was increased to $250,000.</p>
<p>The most significant change under the SHIELD Act is that as of March 21, 2020, “any person or business that owns or licenses computerized data which includes private information of a resident of New York shall develop, implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of the private information including, but not limited to the disposal of data”. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there was not much attention paid to the new requirements. A business or individual is now affirmatively obligated to put in place reasonable safeguards and procedures with regard to the maintenance and security of private information. The SHIELD Act specifies three distinct areas: (1) Reasonable Administrative Safeguards, (2) Reasonable Technical Safeguards and (3) Reasonable Physical Safeguards. The SHIELD Act outlines specific requirements for each of the areas. While the new “safeguards” requirement applies to all businesses or individuals owning or licensing private information, there is a carve out for small businesses (i.e., businesses with less than 50 employees) that provides for a less stringent standard based on the size and scope of the small business.</p>
<p>The SHIELD Act provides that “a small business” is in compliance with the above requirement if the “small business’s security program contains reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are appropriate for the size and complexity of the small business, the nature of the small business’s activities, and the sensitivity of the personal information the small business collects from or about consumers.” Nevertheless, all businesses, including real estate brokerage firms, law firms, title companies, etc., must adhere to the requirements of the SHIELD Act as well as all other data breach and notification laws.</p>
<p><strong>New York City: The Tenant Data Privacy Act</strong></p>
<p>The Tenant Data Privacy Act (“TDPA”) became law in New York City on May 28. The TDPA “would require owners of multiple dwellings that utilize keyless entry systems, including but not limited to key fobs, biometric identifiers and electronic technologies, to provide tenants with a data retention and privacy policy.” The TDPA also sets forth restrictions relating to the use and collection of tenants’ data contained in these systems and databases. It will also require a landlord to do or comply with the following: (1) obtain consent from tenants and other users to use any such information, (2) restrict the sharing of such information with third parties, and (3) require that any data collected be “…removed, anonymized, or destroyed within a given time.” This legislation would establish a private right of action for tenants against a landlord that violates the TDPA. Tenants could sue for compensatory damages or statutory damages ranging from $200 to $1,000 per tenant and could also seek attorney’s fees.</p>
<p>Under the TDPA, building owners would need to provide a “plain language” privacy policy to tenants. The owner of a smart access building, or an agent thereof, must provide to tenants a written policy in plain language that describes, at a minimum, the information listed under subdivision b of § 26-3004 of the TDPA (see <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3vaW6H0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.nyc.gov/3vaW6H0</a>). Similar to the SHIELD Act, the TDPA requires that affirmative “security measures and safeguards” be put in place. If the TDPA is signed into law, it will take effect at the end of June 2021 and there will be a grace period until Jan. 1, 2023 for building owners to come into compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Being Prepared is Critical!</strong></p>
<p>The potential for a cyberattack should never be taken lightly. Individuals and companies must put in place protections to ensure that they are protected. Cyberattacks are very real and all individuals and businesses need to be aware of dangers and risks, and take them seriously. While these hacks and cyberattacks can cost thousands and even millions of dollars in damages, the compromised companies and individuals are also required to spend thousands more to comply with the data breach and notification requirements of state and local laws. Businesses and individuals should look into obtaining cybersecurity insurance coverage as most insurance policies do not cover cyberattacks or the damages and costs incurred as a result. Appropriate cybersecurity coverage will not only cover the damages incurred, but will also provide coverage for the costs involved to send the required notices under the law, which can be very expensive. Once an attack occurs it is too late; preventative measures are critical.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Westchester County Board of Legislators at its meeting on June 28 is expected to vote on co-op disclosure legislation that has the strong support from the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and other real estate and housing advocacy organizations.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Decades of advocating for strong laws to promote co-op disclosure in order to prevent housing discrimination by cooperative boards may finally bear fruit later this month for members of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the consumers they represent.</p>
<p>The Westchester County Board of Legislators at its meeting on June 28 is expected to vote on co-op disclosure legislation that has the strong support from the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and other real estate and housing advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>A host of prominent Westchester County Realtors testified in favor of a long sought-after co-op disclosure bill on May 24 during a virtual public hearing before the Westchester County Board of Legislators.</p>
<p>The amendments to current county law would require that co-op boards provide a reason for the denial of an application when the co-op board notifies the county&#8217;s Human Rights Commission of a denial. The measure would also require disclosure of minimum financial requirements to applicants before they apply. The County Board of Legislators will hold a vote on whether to approve the bill on June 28, according to Philip Weiden, government affairs director for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>Among the many HGAR officials and members that testified before the County Board of Legislators included: HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska, HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty, HGAR President-elect Anthony Domathoti, Legislative Committee Co-Chair Leah Caro, Barry Kramer, John Crittenden, Rey Hollingsworth Falu, Dorothy Botsoe, Jean Tickell, Mary Kingsley and Jerome Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Representatives of co-op management, including members of the Building and Realty Institute, testified against the bill, charging that the measure is unnecessary and would result in increased litigation and insurance costs.</p>
<p>Weiden, who also testified at the session, shot down those claims, noting that in Suffolk County, the Village of Hempstead and Rockland County, where co-op disclosure legislation have been enacted, have not seen marked increases in lawsuits or cooperative insurance costs. He added that since Westchester passed legislation in 2018 requiring co-op Boards adhere to a time frame to respond to purchase applications, more than 500 co-op application denials have been referred to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Caro noted that under current law, a co-op board is not required to inform a shareholder in the cooperative (the seller) the reason for its denial of a purchase application. She later told legislators, “You will likely hear from (co-op) Board members that they do not discriminate. That’s great. Then I argue what is the downside of providing a written reason?”</p>
<p>“As someone who has owned and lived in co-ops for the past 30 years and who has served on co-op Boards, including the position of President of a co-op Board, I fully support the proposed legislation and I applaud the efforts of the Westchester County Board of Legislators to bring about meaningful change to the co-op purchase process,” Haggerty testified. “Change can be difficult, but in this case, change is imperative.”:</p>
<p>A host of HGAR leaders and Westchester Realtors testified of cases where prospective co-op applicants were denied by co-op Boards despite strong credit and financial backgrounds.</p>
<p>“This bill at its heart speaks against inequity, discrimination and to fight back against discrimination in housing,” Domathoti said. “I believe this bill creates a tremendous opportunity to make an important stand for fairness in the co-op purchase and sale markets.”</p>
<p>He added, “To be clear, housing discrimination is abhorrent and has no place in Westchester. Co-ops still have the right to reject unqualified buyers, but some basic level of transparency and predictability in the process should be part of the mix.”</p>
<p>Former HGAR President Kramer, who has been a staunch advocate for cooperative transparency legislation in Westchester and in New York State, said the bill signed into law in December 2018 by Westchester County Executive George Latimer was a “good first step.”</p>
<p>“Now is the time to take this even further and make bold and meaningful changes to the way co-ops are sold,” he testified. “I’ve seen the heartbreak when someone is rejected by a co-op Board with no reason given.”</p>
<p>Noting that there have been more than 500 rejections sent to the county’s Human Rights Commission since 2018, the building and cooperative industry’s claim that there was no need for further regulation was simply not true, he said.</p>
<p>Kramer later added, “If co-op rejections occur mainly for financial reasons, then why are co-op Boards so afraid to share this information?”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS— With mortgage rates near all-time lows and significant pent-up demand, will New York’s residential real estate market favor sellers through 2021 and beyond? Real estate experts weighed in on what’s in store for the housing market and how agents can close deals from the East End to the West Side and all throughout the region at a virtual panel hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. and OneKey® MLS.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 industry professionals registered for “Getting the Deal Done: From The Hamptons to Manhattan, Scarsdale to the Catskills – A Seller’s Market,” which featured Jennifer Grimes, broker/owner, Country House Realty, Sullivan and Ulster counties; Lisa Lippman, associate real estate broker, Brown Harris Stevens, New York City; Laura Miller, associate real estate broker, Houlihan Lawrence, Scarsdale; Ernie Cervi, regional senior vice president, East End, Corcoran, Bridgehampton; and Bruce Cohen, Esq., founding partner, Cohen and Frankel, New York City.</p>
<p>“This seller’s market is going to last – particularly in Westchester, the Hudson Valley and on the East End, for quite some time,” said event host Richard Haggerty, CEO of HGAR and President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer of OneKey® MLS, the regional multiple listing service for New York. “One thing that’s unique to the New York City market is that it doesn’t have the inventory issue that the suburban market has. The point our expert panel makes about pricing correctly really resonates because that’s what’s going to make properties move in Manhattan.”</p>
<p>Haggerty at the June 10th webinar pointed to Sullivan County as the “hottest market we’ve had in our area,” noting an 85% increase in the number of single-family transactions in May compared with May of last year and an almost 10% increase in the median sale price.</p>
<p>Grimes, of Country House Realty, said The Catskills’ market was robust pre-pandemic and a migration from New York City only added to the surge. “The pandemic sped up the process of maturation in terms of people discovering The Catskills, with so many coming up here to hike and do things to get out of New York City,” said Grimes. “The market exploded in an extraordinary way, where in some cases people were trying to buy houses sight unseen. Our value for money is significant here, so people feel they can buy for cash a lot of the time. Our second-home market is really what is driving everything here.”</p>
<p>The discussion was moderated by Brian D. Tormey, NTP, president of TitleVest, a leading New York City-based provider of title insurance and related real estate services. The hour-long session focused on regional market trends, buyer profiles and pricing, negotiating contracts and bidding wars, and how long the seller’s market will last.</p>
<p>“In New York City we had a softer market, then we had COVID and it was super-soft, and now we’re back to where we were, price-wise, pre-pandemic,” said Lippman, of Brown Harris Stevens. “But we have a much better head about things—there’s a feeling of euphoria. A word of caution to sellers: It is still very, very price sensitive. If you properly price something, it moves immediately. If you over-price it, no one calls. And, if you underprice it, you’ll have a crazy bidding war.”</p>
<p>Cohen, an attorney specializing in real estate, talked about the resiliency of Manhattan and advised buyers and sellers to act quickly in this market. “I don’t think we’ve ever been busier and I’ve been doing this a long time,” said Cohen. “One of the reasons is that interest rates just remain so low. Yes, there is euphoria. It was wrong to write off New York City during the pandemic and anyone who thinks this market is going to last forever is wrong, too. But, I would say to every broker, attorney, buyer and seller—if you want to do something, now is the time.”</p>
<p>Miller, of Houlihan Lawrence, noted Westchester’s numbers indicate “it’s definitely” still a seller’s market. “The Westchester market is hot, with pending sales in general up over 90%,” said Miller. “In Scarsdale, which is my main area, it’s up around 80% and in Edgemont, pending sales are up around 200%. There’s just high demand and a real scarcity of inventory. We are still seeing multiple bids and listings at all price ranges are selling significantly over asking.”</p>
<p>Cervi, of Corcoran, noted similar trends on the East End. “The Hamptons market is up 89% over last year in the first quarter,” said Cervi. “The average sale price has tipped $2.7 million and the median price is $1.6 million, which is up 50%. We’re seeing numbers like we’ve never seen before and activity to match. The sellers are very realistic, if they price appropriately, they’re going to have a bidding war and sell over ask in those cases.”</p>
<p>“Getting the Deal Done” is part of the “Be Your Best” webinar series created by HGAR and OneKey® MLS, to help Realtors and agents navigate a changing landscape amid the pandemic. The event was sponsored by TitleVest.</p>
<p>OneKey® MLS has 44,000-plus subscribers and serves Manhattan, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Orange, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. It was formed in 2018 by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors® and the Long Island Board of Realtors®.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors® (www.hgar.com) is a not-for-profit trade association representing more than 13,000 real estate professionals in Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange counties. It is the second-largest Realtor association in New York, and one of the largest in the U.S.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The guilty pleas were the culmination of a four-month investigation launched by the Orange County District Attorney, the New York State Comptroller’s Office and the Town of New Windsor Police Department.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—Three former officials with the Orange County Industrial Development Agency pled guilty earlier today before Orange County Judge Robert J. Prisco to felony corruption and conflict of interest charges, Orange County District Attorney David M. Hoovler announced. The IDA officials included its former managing director Vincent Cozzolino, CEO Laurie Villasuso and former Board Director Edward Diana, a former Orange County Executive and Town of Wallkill Supervisor.</p>
<p>The guilty pleas were the culmination of a four-month investigation launched by the Orange County District Attorney, the New York State Comptroller’s Office and the Town of New Windsor Police Department.</p>
<p>“We do not have an embezzlement, we don’t have a theft of funds, we don’t have missing money,” Orange County District Attorney Hoovler said. “What we have in this case is a pattern of non-disclosed conflicts of interest where these individuals were self-dealing. They were making decisions which benefitted themselves…” He added that their actions “cheated the taxpayers” of Orange County.</p>
<p>Former IDA Managing Director Cozzolino, 62 of Gardiner, pled guilty to Corrupting the Government in the third degree, a Class D felony. Villasuso, 41 of Newburgh, the former CEO of the Orange County IDA, pled guilty to Corrupting the Government in the Fourth Degree, a Class E felony. Diana, 72, of Wallkill, a former member of the Orange County IDA Board, pled guilty to Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the first Degree, a Class E Felony, and Committing a Prohibited Conflict of Interest.</p>
<p>Cozzolino and Villasuso each admitted that they acted in concert in a scheme to defraud the IDA through payments the IDA made to Galileo Technology Group, Inc., a company Cozzolino had a 50% ownership interest in. Villasuso and Diana each were employed by Galileo while also either working directly for the IDA or in Diana’s case serving on its IDA Board as a volunteer.</p>
<p>In their sentencing disposition agreements with the Orange County District Attorney, Cozzolino has agreed to reimburse the IDA $1 million. Villasuso has agreed to reimburse the IDA $175,000, while Diana has agreed to pay the IDA $90,000, which was the funds Diana took home from his employment with Galileo Technology Group., Inc. Cozzolino, Villasuso and Diana have agreed to make restitution by the time they are sentenced on Sept. 10, 2021. The District Attorney is recommending Cozzolino be given probation, Villasuso a conditional discharge and Diana also be granted conditional discharge. Diana has also agreed to cooperate with the District Attorney and State Comptroller’s Office in the preparation of a report on the flaws of the IDA operations, which should be issued in a few weeks. If Diana complies with the terms of the agreement, his felony plea would be reduced to a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The investigation of the IDA centered on conflicts of interest, particularly surrounding the IDA’s Accelerator program, which was managed by Cozzolino and Galileo Technology Group.</p>
<p>District Attorney Hoovler and State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and others at a press conference held at the Legislative Chambers at the Orange County Government Center in Goshen, also took aim at the lack of oversight of the then Orange County IDA Board of Directors, which was removed by the Orange County Legislature in March 2021 after legislators became aware of possible conflicts of interest at the IDA.</p>
<p>New York State Comptroller DiNapoli said of the three individuals who pled guilty in the case: “Although their scheme was complex, their motives were simple: greed. We must have zero-tolerance for public corruption. Thanks to our partnership with Orange County District Attorney David M. Hoovler and the New Windsor Police, we were able to bring their crimes to light and recover their ill-gotten gains.”</p>
<p>Stephen R. Coffey, Esq. and Scott W. Iseman, Esq., attorney for Cozzolino released a prepared statement, which in part read: “Vincent deeply regrets his conduct, has accepted responsibility for what he did wrong and has made the Orange County IDA whole.”</p>
<p>They characterized the Orange County IDA’s embattled Accelerator program as a “true economic development engine” that attracted diverse industries to Orange County including minority-owned and women-owned businesses.</p>
<p>The statement concluded: “Vincent’s mistakes should not overshadow the many great achievements that young companies and entrepreneurs made while working with the IDA’s accelerator program, and still can make in the Orange County community.”</p>
<p>Villasuso had no comment when contacted by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>.</p>
<p>Ben Ostrer, an attorney for former County Executive Diana, said in a report in the <em>Middletown Times Herald Record</em>. “If this could happen to Ed Diana, this could happen to anyone. If you are in government service be thankful it isn’t you.”</p>
<p>District Attorney Hoovler said the case was complicated by the lack of oversight by the IDA Board and its Legal Counsel and the approvals granted to in some cases poorly written contracts and expenses with little transparency or backup. He said their incompetence and negligence gave Cozzolino and Villasuso a “built-in defense.” However, Hoovler said that the sheer volume of the conflicts of interest and multiple methods they used to “make money and try to hide it,” overcome that defense.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The New York State of Emergency effectively ended on June 24, 2021. With its ending, many of the regulations enacted by the governor ended as well. We’ve been waiting for this emergency to end for over a year. So now with the ending of the emergency and a transition back to what is “normal,” Realtors should be asking themselves, “So now what?” What do we do regarding open houses, mask wearing, social distancing, vaccinations and COVID-19 forms? This week’s article is a cheat-sheet of sorts of best practices and reminders.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>The cold calling ban is over. You can, once again, cold call, so long as the recipient is not on the Do Not Call Registry. Make sure you check.</p>
<p><strong>Mask Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Federal CDC guidance will still remain in effect in New York. This means that unvaccinated individuals will still be required to wear masks. Masks will still be required on all public transportation, as well as in certain settings such as pre-K through grade 12, large-scale indoor events, nursing homes, health care facilities, homeless shelters, etc. Masks may also be required by individual brokerage offices in order to enter, as well as homeowners may require the use of masks regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p><strong>Refusal to Wear a Mask</strong></p>
<p>If an individual refuses to wear a mask, the Realtor should not go forward with allowing the person access to the property. It is expected that all persons comply with the guidelines to keep others safe from possible exposure. All Realtors are obligated under the Real Property Law to act in an honest and trustworthy manner. To allow a person access to a property without a mask, when a mask is required, would be a violation of the law and could subject the Realtor to potential loss of licensure. It may also be deemed a violation of the Code of Ethics (Article 1 and 3).</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Forms</strong></p>
<p>These forms were never mandatory, but they were effectively used during the pandemic to screen parties. Use of these forms are still at the discretion of the homeowner and a discussion should be held early on in a Realtor’s representation of a homeowner as to whether the homeowner wishes to continue to utilize them. If a homeowner requires the execution of any COVID-19 form in order to gain access to a property, that request must be complied with.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccines</strong></p>
<p>For people who are fully vaccinated (two weeks post completion of full vaccine regime) masks and social distancing are no longer required. For those that are not fully vaccinated (for example, the person received only one of two shots; two weeks have not passed since the last shot; children are not yet eligible for a vaccine and those who choose not to get vaccinated), they are still required to wear masks, maintain social distancing and continue to hand wash and disinfect high-touch surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses and Homeowner</strong>: Can still require masks on their premises regardless of vaccination status. However, they cannot prevent those that are not fully vaccinated from entering the premises; they can only require the use of masks/disinfectant if a party is not fully vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Vaccinatio</strong>n: Vaccination proof can be provided in two different ways: (1) physical proof in the form of a vaccine card, Excelsior Pass, digital application, etc.; or (2) self-reporting/the honor system.</p>
<p><strong>Open Houses/Showings</strong></p>
<p>Open houses and showing may now resume as they were in the past. A listing agent should discuss showings with the seller/landlord and decide on what proof of vaccination they are comfortable with. For people not wearing masks, the Realtor can ask for proof of vaccination prior to entering the property. This would mean that the listing agent would need to be at the door or have someone at the door verifying vaccination status. If a homeowner is comfortable, the listing agent could require cooperating brokers to verify that all parties are fully vaccinated (including the agent). If asked, cooperating agents would be required to confirm the status of themselves and their clients (Code of Ethics Art. 1 and NYRPL requires agents to be honest and truthful and treat all parties fairly). For all individuals not providing proof of vaccination, masks must be worn and high touch surfaces or surfaces that were touched must be cleaned and disinfected. If the homeowner refuses to require proof of vaccination in an acceptable form, all parties must wear masks and maintain six feet of social distancing. <strong>NOTE</strong>: Those that refuse to provide proof of vaccination upon request should be treated as unvaccinated (mask/social distancing required).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the State of Emergency has been lifted, there are some regulations that are still in place which are designed to continue to keep us all safe. Continue to abide by them and act in a safe manner in the interests of safety. Respect other’s rights and they will respect yours.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The legislative victory ends more than 30 years of advocacy by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and its predecessor organizations to advance full transparency in cooperative real estate transactions in Westchester County in order to prevent possible discrimination against consumers they re]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Board of Legislators in a 15-2 vote last night approved an amendment to the existing Co-Op Disclosure Law that now requires a cooperative Board of Directors to provide a reason for a denial of an applicant seeking to purchase a unit at their property. The measure went into effect immediately as Westchester County Executive George Latimer told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> exclusively that later Monday evening he signed the bill into law.</p>
<p>The legislative victory ends more than 30 years of advocacy by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and its predecessor organizations to advance full transparency in cooperative real estate transactions in Westchester County in order to prevent possible discrimination against consumers they represent.</p>
<p>In 2018 the Westchester County Board of Legislators approved a bill (Local Law 2018-11) that provided for specific time frames on acknowledging receipt of an individual’s application (15 days) and informing the applicant of its decision to accept or reject its application (60 days). However, that legislation did not include a requirement for the cooperative board to provide the applicant with a reason for a denial.</p>
<p>The amendment to the existing law sponsored by Legislator Catherine Borgia calls for the cooperative board of directors to provide notice of a rejection to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission and it also requires the disclosure of minimum financial requirements to applicants by the cooperative board before they apply.</p>
<p>The cooperative board at a minimum is now required to divulge, in addition to its reason for denial, the following: the full legal name and address of the Cooperative Housing Corporation; the full address and unit number of the unit that had been applied for; the full names, addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses (if available) for the denied applicant(s) and seller(s); the full names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses (if available) for all legal counsel and real estate brokers involved in the rejected transaction; the date of receipt of the initial application; the date of receipt of the completed application and the date of rejection.</p>
<p>The amendment also requires the completed notice of rejection form to be transmitted to the Human Rights Commission within 15 days of the notice being provided to the prospective purchaser.</p>
<div id="attachment_37160" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37160" class="wp-image-37160" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CO-OP-HEARING-PIC2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-37160" class="wp-caption-text">Westchester County Board of Legislators Chairman Ben Boykin presided over the first in-person BOL session since the COVID pandemic began last year.</p></div>
<p>Other key changes to the existing Co-Op Disclosure law include all members of cooperative housing corporations are required to undertake fair housing training. The provision, which was advanced by the Building and Realty Institute of Westchester &amp; Mid-Hudson Region and its affiliate Cooperative and Condominium Advisory Council, requires that any new member of a cooperative governing board have a minimum of two hours of fair housing training within 60 days of becoming a member of the board. All members of a governing board are required to have a minimum of two hours of fair housing training every two years.</p>
<p>Legislator Borgia in a speech prior to the vote, noted that the late Westchester County Legislator Lois Bronz first introduced co-op reform legislation in 1990 and since then notable legislators including now New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart Cousins and now New York State Senator Peter Harckham also championed co-op reform bills during their tenures as a county legislator.</p>
<p>“I think the time is now to pass this law in Westchester County,” Borgia, who is also a Realtor with Keller Williams NY Realty in White Plains, said. “Frankly, I am hoping that this will trigger a re-look in New York State.” Attempts to pass legislation requiring cooperative boards across New York State to cite a reason for an applicant’s denial have failed to secure approval from the New York State Legislature to date.</p>
<p>Borgia, as well as Westchester County Board of Legislators Chairman Ben Boykin are hopeful that their action last night will help advance similar legislation in Albany. Boykin, who voted in favor of the bill, noted that legislators took out a provision calling for boards to provide an applicant a reason for a denial back in 2018 to see if there was indeed a problem that existed. He noted that since the bill was passed, there have been 553 rejections by co-op boards advanced to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>“Something is going on,” he noted. Boykin added that he is hopeful that state legislators will follow Westchester’s lead and bring further transparency to the co-op purchasing process statewide.</p>
<p>Prior to the vote, a host of HGAR officials and members asked lawmakers to approve the co-op disclosure amendment.</p>
<p>HGAR Government Affairs Director Philip Weiden told lawmakers that charges made by opponents of the bill that litigation against co-op boards would increase as would their operating costs due to the new requirements were simply unfounded. Westchester now joins Suffolk County in requiring co-op boards to disclose the reason for a denial of an applicant.</p>
<p>HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty related that he has resided in a cooperative for the past 30 years and has served on co-op boards, including a stint as president. “I support the efforts of the Westchester County Board of Legislators to bring about meaningful change to the co-op purchase process. Change can be difficult and is sometimes resisted, however, in this instance change is necessary to create more transparency and structure for co-op transactions,” he said.</p>
<p>Former HGAR President Barry Kramer, a longtime advocate for co-op disclosure reform in Westchester and throughout New York State, praised the bill for its transparency requirements, as well as the fair housing training provision. Kramer, who has specialized in co-op transactions, said that most co-op boards say that they reject applicants for financial reasons. “Well, now we will be able to better understand on each and every co-op transaction, why those rejections occurred,” he related.</p>
<p>Other Realtors speaking at the Board of Legislators session on Monday evening in favor of the co-op disclosure amendment were: HGAR President-elect Anthony Domathoti and Realtor John Crittenden.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive Latimer said that the bill was advanced by Westchester County legislators and sparked debate between Realtor interests and the building industry, which had concerns over its impact on cooperative operations.</p>
<p>“I understand the rationale for it, which is there needs to be a rational process that a potential seller of a unit and the buyer of the unit can look at and understand. Otherwise they are trapped in a unit they want to get rid of or they are unable to get into a unit they want to get into,” he said.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This may be the most difficult thing I’ve ever written as goodbyes often are. Although I know I have made the right decision to retire it does not come without ambivalence. It is difficult to imagine that I won’t be waking up each morning and heading to the job I love and have loved doing for the past rewarding 40 years.</p>
<p>At the start of any position, we usually don’t have an awareness that we are embarking on a long-term career that will become our personal identity. Prior to being hired as the executive officer of the then Orange County Board of Realtors, my entire real estate education consisted of being on the selling side of one home and the buying side of two. Not a very auspicious knowledge base for an organization whose members expected you to know license law, the Realtor Code of Ethics and all there was to know at that time about the MLS.</p>
<p>Perhaps those who hired me, a committee headed by John Dwyer, a past OCAR and NYSAR President, saw that spark of excitement in me knowing I would be taking on a challenge as well as my candid acknowledgement that while I knew truly little about real estate, I could learn. Admittedly, at the time, I had no idea how much there was to know and that the learning curve would continue for four decades.</p>
<p>Many Realtors and colleagues along the way were generous in their kindness and in their willingness to share their expertise. Generosity, I have learned, abounds in the Realtor community. I begin to realize just how long I’ve been around when I recognize that my mentor George Kohl, a past NYSAR President, is not a familiar name to many. Nonetheless, his support gave me credibility within the Realtor community, and I am forever grateful. I’ve also had the good fortune to have as a role model, a voice of reason and colleague Gil Mercurio, who began his career with the former Westchester County Board of Realtors (WCBR) when I began mine in Orange County. I probably got to know Richard Haggerty (finally, a familiar name) very soon after Gil hired him, and we established a rapport that has turned into a valued friendship. I will miss our daily professional interactions but have no doubt that the friendship will endure.</p>
<p>Anyone who has achieved any recognition or success in any field realizes that it is not done in a vacuum. To my credit, I have made some excellent staff decisions and they have been my ballast as well as my silent partners without ever seeking or getting the recognition they truly deserve.</p>
<p>While I will miss it all and look forward to new adventures, I realize it is all about the incredible interaction over the years; you have truly helped to make me “all that I could be.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of Justice announced on July 1 it was withdrawing from a settlement it had reached with the National Association of Realtors last November in order “to permit a broader investigation of NAR’s rules and conduct to proceed without restriction.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department has also filed to voluntarily dismiss its complaint against NAR without prejudice. The department stated in an announcement that it determined the settlement “will not adequately protect the department’s rights to investigate other conduct by NAR that could impact competition in the real estate market and may harm home sellers and home buyers.”</p>
<p>“The proposed settlement will not sufficiently protect the Antitrust Division’s ability to pursue future claims against NAR,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Richard A. Powers of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “Real estate is central to the American economy and consumers pay billions of dollars in real estate commissions every year. We cannot be bound by a settlement that prevents our ability to protect competition in a market that profoundly affects Americans’ financial well-being.”</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors released a statement to the media in reaction to the U.S. Justice Department’s actions, which stated that the withdrawal from the settlement was a “complete, unprecedented breach of an agreement” that had been reached with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division.</p>
<p>“Grounded in our commitment to act in the best interests of buyers and sellers, we regularly update our rules and policies to protect consumers and provide transparency,” the spokesperson stated according to a <em>Housingwire.com</em> report. “NAR has fulfilled all of our obligations under the settlement agreement and now DOJ is inexplicably backing out. If the department does not live up to its commitments under the terms of the agreement, we are confident in our pro-consumer and pro-competition policies.”</p>
<p>The Department of Justice explained that in its complaint and settlement filed on Nov. 19, 2020 that it alleged NAR had established and enforced certain rules and policies that illegally restrained competition in residential real estate services. The proposed settlement sought to remedy those illegal practices and encourage greater competition among Realtors, but it also prevented the department from pursuing other antitrust claims relating to NAR’s rules.</p>
<p>The department stated that it sought NAR’s agreement to modify the settlement to adequately protect and preserve the department’s rights to investigate and challenge additional conduct by NAR, but the department and NAR could not reach an agreement.” Because the settlement resolved only some of the department’s concerns with NAR’s rules, this step ensures that the department can continue to enforce the antitrust laws in this important market,” the DOJ stated.</p>
<p>Back in November 2020, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> reported that NAR General Counsel Katie Johnson in the Realtor Magazine section of NAR’s website, stated, “Our rules and policies have long been recognized for creating a competitive and efficient market that benefits home buyers and sellers. This agreement resolves the DOJ’s questions about the multiple listing service (MLS) and commissions and enables NAR to remain focused on supporting our members as they preserve, protect, and advance the American dream of homeownership.”</p>
<p>NAR 2021 President Charlie Oppler added in a videotaped statement back in November, “We want to be absolutely clear that while NAR disagrees with the characterization of our rules and policies and NAR admits no liability, wrongdoing or truth of any allegations by the DOJ, NAR has agreed to make certain changes to its rules to address the questions raised by the DOJ.”</p>
<p>NAR’s Johnson, who also serves as the association’s Chief Member Experience Officer, stated that although the exact language of the settlement agreement was still being finalized for NAR’s rule changes, most of the changes seek to more explicitly state what is already the spirit and intent of NAR’s Code of Ethics and MLS policies regarding providing information about commissions and MLS participation.</p>
<p>“Buying a home is one of life’s biggest and most important financial decisions,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division stated back in November 2020. “Home buyers and sellers should be aware of all the broker fees they are paying. Today’s settlement prevents traditional brokers from impeding competition—including by Internet-based methods of home buying and selling—by providing greater transparency to consumers about broker fees. This will increase price competition among brokers and lead to better quality of services for American home buyers and sellers.”</p>
<p>According to the complaint that has now been dismissed, DOJ alleged that NAR’s anticompetitive rules, policies, and practices include: (i) prohibiting MLSs that are affiliated with NAR from disclosing to prospective buyers the commission that the buyer broker will earn; (ii) allowing buyer brokers to misrepresent to buyers that a buyer broker’s services are free; (iii) enabling buyer brokers to filter MLS listings based on the level of buyer broker commissions offered; and (iv) limiting access to the lockboxes that provide licensed brokers with access to homes for sale to brokers who work for a NAR-affiliated MLS. These NAR rules, policies, practices have been widely adopted by NAR-affiliated MLSs resulting in decreased competition among real estate brokers, the DOJ charged.</p>
<p>NAR General Counsel Johnson went on to state on the NAR website that in accordance with the MLS system’s long-standing focus on creating an efficient, transparent marketplace for home buyers and sellers, the amount of compensation offered to buyers’ agents for each MLS listing will be made publicly available. Publicly accessible MLS data feeds will include offers of compensation, and buyers’ agents will have an affirmative obligation to provide such information to their clients for homes of interest.</p>
<p>“Relatedly, the rule changes re-affirm that MLSs and brokerages, as always, must provide consumers all properties that fit their criteria regardless of compensation offered or the name of the listing brokerage,” NAR’s Johnson wrote.</p>
<p>She also noted that there will be a rule enacted that will more definitively stated that buyers’ agents cannot represent their services as free to clients.</p>
<p>Finally, with the seller’s prior approval, a licensed real estate agent will have access to the lockboxes of properties listed on an MLS even if the agent does not subscribe to the MLS, NAR added.</p>
<p>“In entering this agreement with the DOJ, NAR disagrees with the DOJ’s characterization of our rules and policies, and NAR admits no liability, wrongdoing, or truth of any allegations by the DOJ. The agreement does not subject NAR to any fines or payments,” NAR’s Johnson stated last November.</p>
<p>She continued, “We’re proud to be associated with the MLS system that puts consumers first and benefits home buyers, sellers, and small-business brokerages—and is constantly building upon these principles. This agreement furthers NAR’s and the MLS system’s goal of creating an efficient marketplace that fosters cooperation between brokers for the benefit of consumers.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This past HGAR scored a big victory on Co-op transparency legislation and fair housing. The Westchester County Board of Legislators passed, and County Executive George Latimer signed a bill mandating co-ops provide a reason in writing to buyers if they are rejected by a co-op board from the purchase of a co-op. They also must tell them why financially they do not meet the co-op’s requirements.</p>
<p>This is a big win for HGAR and for prospective co-op purchasers. We have to thank Legislator Catherine Borgia who was the main sponsor of the bill, and put her position on the line to do what is right. She spoke of how this fight started in 1990 in the Board of Legislators. The new law passed by a vote of 15 to 2 indicating its broad support. The measure also included Fair Housing training for co-op board members. This is a great step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The arguments against the bill were simply wrong. There are no cases of co-op increases in insurance costs associated with the Village of Hempstead law, or Suffolk County, or Nassau County laws. There have been no major lawsuits. This legislation does not take away the co-op board’s power.</p>
<p>Finally, now it is time for New York State to act. We always hear about fair housing from our legislators, yet they have not acted for decades on co-op reform. We know boards have major power in New York City, but that is not an excuse. We are always open to negotiation and change to improve the proposed bill, but fundamentally we must pass a reason requirement. We urge all Realtors and their clients to contact their state legislators and push for this.</p>
<p>Thank you to all who contributed to this great victory. Stay tuned for future updates.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—It’s no secret that the residential housing buying frenzy is continuing with a vengeance in our region, with properties still receiving multiple offers and many would-be home buyers left in the dust.</p>
<p>Low interest rates, currently hovering around 3%, are helping to ignite the desire for home ownership. Lenders throughout the New York metro area have also indicated that some FHA loans can even dip as low as 2.5%. But, how long will these super low rates last, and when will the market eventually return to “normal?”</p>
<p>Irene Amato, owner of A.S.A.P. Mortgage, believes the low single digit rates will be with us for quite a while. “Even if interest rates manage to jump up a full percentage point, we’ll still be at about 4%, which is a fantastic rate,” she said. Headquartered in Peekskill, A.S.A.P. now has eight locations in the Hudson Valley, and will soon be opening a branch in Connecticut and Florida.</p>
<p>Amato’s firm handles about 80% purchases and 20% refinances. “We’re still seeing about the same influx of people, even though there are not a lot of properties out there,” she said. “People new to the market are realizing the value of home ownership and we have a lot of first-time home buyers actually coming in for counseling.”</p>
<p>Typically, lenders review a potential buyer’s income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, property type and other factors when considering a loan. “What’s starting to happen now is that when buyers bid way over the asking price, there could be a problem if the bank appraisal comes in low,” explained Amato. “In some cases, the buyer would need additional cash to cover the amount that is not going to be covered by the lender.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, noted Amato, the potential buyers need to take a step back and reconsider what and where they’re buying. “That’s why it’s so important for people to review all of their information with their real estate agent, attorney and lender,” she added. “Thankfully, we’ve been able to save some deals because we have the ability to shop rates with a bigger pool of lenders.”</p>
<p>Amato is hopeful that the new leadership at the Federal Housing Finance Agency will help open more doors for first-time buyers. “They’re looking into being able to deliver more affordable mortgages, along with expanding the guidelines for affordable housing mortgages,” she said. “I think this can be a great thing, but it needs to be dealt with very delicately—we don’t want to set someone up to fail.”</p>
<p>Both Amato and David Mizrahi, director of sales and vice president of business development for FM Home Loans, agree that the whole home buying process is a very emotional one. Recently, Mizrahi has witnessed a new resurgence in New York City, following last year’s exodus to the suburbs. With offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, Mizrahi has seen a lot more activity lately, particularly in Manhattan.</p>
<p>His offices have been busy with closings on co-ops, condos, multi-family and single- family properties throughout the boroughs and on Long Island. “Things are definitely picking up now that the pandemic is on its way out,” he said. “We’re seeing that people are not so hesitant to house hunt in the city anymore. Everyone was expecting New York City to die out, but I always laughed at that.”</p>
<p>Mizrahi predicts the rates will stay low for the time being, with a possibility of a slight increase. “I don’t see them going up dramatically over the next six months,” he said. “I think anything under 5% is really good rate.”</p>
<p>Recalling 20 years ago, when rates hovered in the double digits, Mizrahi said he can’t see those days returning any time soon. “Of course, everything depends on the economy,” he added.</p>
<p>While New York City properties are selling for close to asking price—or some slightly above asking price—Mizrahi said that’s not the case on Long Island. “There’s still a lot of bidding wars and people are offering thousands over the listed prices. That, in turn, can affect their mortgage because if a property doesn’t appraise for the full value, the buyers will need a larger cash down payment,” he explained.</p>
<p>As some city renters may still have eyes for the Hudson Valley when it comes to purchasing, Mizrahi notes they’re not losing any business from people who still want mortgages for New York City properties. “Look what happened after 9/11, people said that no one would be living in lower Manhattan and now buildings are just getting bigger and more people are moving in,” he said. “Things are slowly starting to get back to normal. Time heals everything.”</p>
<p>On the commercial lending front, Robert Withers, president of M1 Capital, also believes the lower interest rates will be with us for the foreseeable future. “Commercial loan rates have always been a bit higher than residential, due to the fact that they are investment properties and are inherently riskier,” explained Withers. “Still, we’re seeing very low rates averaging between the high three’s and four’s.”</p>
<p>Because commercial investments are reliant on income from tenants, there was a lot of speculation about the commercial real estate market that the pandemic would cause massive vacancies. “There were gloom and doom forecasts for the commercial market, but so far, I haven’t seen a lot of distressed situations,” said Withers. “Lenders have been willing to work with borrowers because most lenders don’t want to have to foreclose and be stuck with properties.”</p>
<p>In many cases, lenders will help clients put together a plan, which sometimes involves repurposing the properties. Restaurants and bars, among the hardest hit by the pandemic, are now slowly starting to come back. “Now that we’re seeing a huge volume of people vaccinated, I think you’re going to see more restaurants opening back up, as well as retail stores,” Withers said.</p>
<p>Concerning office space, Withers noted that many employers are offering people more flexible schedules with the ability to work at home a few days a week. “Actually, Realtors have had this business model forever—the most profitable real estate offices are those where most of the people are not in the office all the time,” he added.<br />
.<br />
M1 Capital works with clients throughout the New York metro area, providing financing for all types of commercial venues including apartments, condominiums, hotels, retail outlets, office complexes, restaurants, storage facilities, warehouses and much more. His firm also handles renovation loans and refinancing.</p>
<p>Most recently, Withers has been very busy in the Bronx and Yonkers, with new construction projects starting to resurface. His focus is on loans from $1 million to $25 million. “As far as business is concerned, I honestly think it’s going to get even better,” he admitted. “I also believe the interest rates will stay low until the end of 2022. The Fed has signaled they’ll work to keep the rates low so they can keep the economy rebounding.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>To say that there has been a lot on the plate for Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus would be an understatement. In his second term of office he had to deal with the death and devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic beginning in March 2020.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em>, Neuhaus discusses how he used his experience in the military to spearhead county operations in the tumultuous and tragic early days of the pandemic. He also talked frankly about the scandal at the <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/news/breaking-news-three-former-orange-county-ida-officials-plead-guilty-to-felony-corruption-charges/">Orange County Industrial Development Agency</a>, the changes he feels are necessary at the IDA and whether the plea bargain reached by three IDA officials with prosecutors that required reimbursement of well over $1 million, but no jail time, was appropriate. Neuhaus also discusses the Orange County economy post COVID and how important a possible expansion of Route 17 would be for Orange County and New York State.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37323 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neuhausheadshot.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="375" />A life-long Orange County resident, Neuhaus and his two sisters were raised on a working farm in Southern Orange County that is still operational today. He attended Monroe-Woodbury High School and took courses at SUNY Orange during his senior year. Neuhaus went on to receive a Bachelor Degree in History/Political Science from Mount Saint Mary College as well as a Master Degree in Public Administration from Marist College. He is also a graduate of Orange County’s Leadership Orange program.</p>
<p>Neuhaus is a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserves, currently assigned to a Naval Special Warfare team. He has earned two warfare designations: Seabee Combat Warfare (SCW) Officer and Navy Expeditionary Supply Corps Officer (NESCO) and holds certifications from the Naval War College and the Joint Special Operations University. He also received his Joint Professional Military Education I degree in National Securities Studies in May 2019. Neuhaus returned in June 2019 from a six-month deployment to Iraq after serving with the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force.</p>
<p>Neuhaus, a Republican, was sworn into office on Jan. 1, 2014 after having served as the Town of Chester’s Supervisor for six years. At deadline, he is running unopposed for a third term of office this November.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With COVID infection rates and deaths down in Orange County and elsewhere throughout the state, do you believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us? And if that is true, how has Orange County emerged from the COVID pandemic?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> I think the worst is behind us. I think we have come out strong out of it, although it was damaging. So, about a month-and-a-half ago (after) I got assigned to the Pacific Fleet in March as a commanding officer of a new unit—my first command assignment, I was out in Hawaii and Hawaii is really strict. They are just loosening up now as you are interviewing me… But to put it in perspective, Hawaii has 1.7 million people, Orange County has 400,000 people. We have significantly more deaths (861 in Orange County from COVID-19 as of July 6, 2021) than they did and even a lot more than some of the other counties in New York State. There were a couple of factors: we felt the brunt of the pandemic early. It hit the Northeast, in particular, New York and New Jersey, the hardest. Some of these other states had the ability to play “Monday Morning Quarterback” to see what was going to happen to them. We have definitely emerged stronger, but we did have some significant damage done. Some of the damage that we are still reeling from today is the massive amount of people that are still unemployed, which has gone down, but employers still have to pay unemployment, while at the same time they need to fill employment positions. There are many cases where I have employers that are paying for 20 people who are on unemployment, their jobs are available for those 20 individuals to come back to work, they (the workers) are protected from not coming back and the employer is forced to hire another 20 people to make up for that gap.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37324 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neuhauspolicememorial2021.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="269" />So, that seems to be the legacy problem that I am dealing with now, as well as some problems with landlords, because of protections not being able to evict and not having tenants pay, they have recurring bills but they don’t have that income coming in. I believe this will all be fixed by September if the federal government doesn’t keep extending it… I think the worst is behind us.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> County Executive Neuhaus said he was still keeping a watchful eye on the Delta variant and its possible impact on the county, but noted that due to the high number of vaccinations, the county’s worst days are behind it in terms of the pandemic. He added that sales tax collections are up 24% from last year. Approximately 70% of that increase was collected right after the economy first opened back up in May and June of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In looking back on the past 16 months of the pandemic, is there any event or moment that affected you personally the most and has there been anything positive to come out of this that you can point to?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> At the beginning of the pandemic it was mitigating the deaths and exposures and also resupplying and providing supplies for hospitals, nursing homes and even towns, villages and cities and for their police departments. That was our beginning mode. We had to buy 18 ventilators. The county was suppling a majority of the PPEs for nursing homes and a good chunk of the supplies for the hospitals and then buying refrigerated trucks to store the (human) remains in. The team during that stage was phenomenal. We had hospital staff embedded in our 911 Center. As much as it was a burden and difficult to get through, from a military perspective it was my sweet spot. I felt at home. I think the people did a phenomenal job. I think most Americans don’t want to be spectators. They want to be part of the action—part of the solution and they did that. Then we moved into kind of a pause last summer. The (COVID infection) numbers went down, some things opened up, however most things were canceled… Then all of a sudden, we get into the fall and right after Thanksgiving things skyrocketed and we were in the next phase of this. Right before Christmas, the vaccines came out and we had to assemble a team of a few hundred people, a third of which were volunteers, to run these mass vaccination clinics. So, that was another proud moment for me as an American to see people from all walks of life coming together. I had people that were wealthy, that were poor, people that were in other professions that just took a leave of absence to volunteer to be part of something bigger than them. So, those are some things that I will never forget…</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In 2021 has the commercial/industrial sector demand continued to be strong in Orange County and if so, are there any major users mulling investments in the county? Also, tourism and the TV film production sectors appear to be emerging industries in the county. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-37326" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="289" />Neuhaus:</strong> The commercial and residential sectors have been off the charts. Just for an example in residential, we had 10,000 new people register to vote six weeks before Election Day last November. Most of those people left the five boroughs, they were fleeing from what happened with COVID and I think from some of the civil unrest, to get to a better lifestyle and that has fueled the housing market. You talk to people from around the county and the housing market is hot—Florida, Colorado, all these places are seeing surges.</p>
<p>You are also seeing a surge in Orange County’s commercial market. A lot of distribution still, which has some positives and negatives depending on how people read it. I think it is good, but you have to pick the right ones for you and you don’t have to give away the store for each one. I see (demand) off the chart. On a regular basis I am meeting with people, including in Manhattan where I have been going back about every two weeks now, meeting with big executives that are kicking the tires to come up here (mainly for back office).</p>
<p>If you look at some of these companies that are down in New York City, some of them are telling me they are never going back to a physical footprint. They have been working from home for so long, that their new model will be to rent a massive amount of hotel rooms quarterly and use their conference rooms to meet with their clients if they need to physically meet. They have gotten so accustomed to Zoom, it has really accelerated the transformation of our society probably by 25 years just because of COVID…</p>
<p>I see a lot of activity in commercial and still heavy in distribution. We are still getting demand for 500,000-square-foot to 1 million-square-foot big distribution centers with some manufacturing aspects to it. We have this big company called “Royal Wine,” they are the biggest kosher wine manufacturers in the world, they are in New Jersey and they have bought the old Kikkerfrosch (now Tri-State Logistics) site in Goshen and they are moving full speed on it. They are going through the approval process right now. We also have a lot of companies, such as Top Golf, Bass Pro, things of that nature that have a recreational and tourism, aspect to them (that are looking at investing in Orange County).</p>
<p>Tourism is off the charts. You are going to see the county do a number of things. Our Concert series is booming at Orange County Speedway. If you are a local guy like me, 20 years ago (concerts) were hot here with all sorts of major acts. Kind of died down for a bit, but now it is emerging strong. Toby Keith, Cheap Trick, George Thorogood are headlining this year’s acts, but there are many, many more. I am getting calls regularly to not only have concerts at the Fairgrounds, but also at the county parks. All of those festivals that were canceled in the Hudson Valley are almost all now (taking place) in Orange County… <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> County Executive said it will be doing 10 drive-thru festivals in 2021. He added that the German Festival usually held at Hunter Mountain, will be held in Orange County at county parks in September and October. He also noted that television/film production has increased significantly in the county to the point that demand for more production space has put some strain on the distribution sector of the commercial market since the production firms are also seeking warehouse and distribution type facilities in the county.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Recently, chief officials of the Orange County Industrial Development Agency pled guilty to corruption charges and agreed to reimbursements totaling well in excess of $1 million to the agency. Do you believe that major changes need to be made and if so, please explain? Also, do you feel that their plea deals with the District Attorney and State Comptroller should have included some jail time?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> First off, I think there should be major changes. The IDA historically has been a “Good Old Boys’ Club.” Its (Directors) are appointed solely by the Legislature with no input from the County Executive whereas we have a ton of other Boards—Orange County Community College, Soil &amp; Water Boards, Agricultural Boards and Development Boards, where the County Executive makes recommendations and the Legislature confirms or denies them. I have never had any of my confirmations denied since I have been in office. They have all been historically unanimous votes. The IDA is its own animal. It has been appointed by the Legislature and to me everybody that has been on it for the most part is riddled with conflicts. Whether it is the industry they work for or the industry they represent, that inherently starts off with major conflicts. Many of the members of the IDA Boards have had their personal companies benefit from them being on the IDA. That should stop. They need to pick some people without conflicts. It can be done. I did it with Orange County Community College, which was sinking financially. I put on four Board members—retired bankers, retired accountants—that knew their way around both good and bad times and they straightened it out. So, I think that could help with the IDA. Those (conflict) rules are going to be coming down sooner or later, whether it is the Legislature that is proactive and makes some of those steps themselves or whether it comes down from a higher power like the state or somewhere else.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37325 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-Neuhaus.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" />I think those who pled guilty, in particular the $1-million man, should have gotten jail. He was the kingpin of this and the whole thing stinks to the public of rich man’s justice—you pay your money back and you don’t have to go to jail. By the way, if you pay it back in a month or two, your felonies are going to be reduced to misdemeanors… When we saw this whole case portrayed to us on how blatantly they ripped off the taxpayers, because I consider it taxpayer money, some people don’t, but it is, you are defraying taxes. So, I am disappointed in the sentences (plea agreements). I think the punishment does not match the crime… I think this is just a chapter that is closed. I think you are going to see a few more chapters develop over the next few months if not years as they try to really fix what happened here…</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The New York State Department of Transportation recently held a webinar on its ongoing study of the possible expansion of Route 17. The DOT study, which is expected to be released at the end of October, pegs the cost of the expansion at anywhere from $245 million to as much as $1 billion, depending upon the scope of the project. Is this project critical to the region and is it feasible considering the high cost?</p>
<p><strong>Neuhaus:</strong> This project is critical for the State of New York, not the region. There is no region in the State of New York that has the amount of tourism value that is being developed right now than Orange County—nobody. Dinosaur Park is being done (in the Town of Wallkill), LEGOLAND New York, the largest Legoland in the world until the Chinese get theirs online (just opened). This is a prime opportunity. The same thing with Woodbury Common, which is poised to do a massive expansion. All those will benefit from the expansion of Route 17. I think there has never been a better opportunity than today. Whether it’s $1 billion, $1.5 billion or $500 million, whatever that number is, there will never be a better opportunity in my lifetime. There is a massive federal infrastructure bill, you have the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer from New York State, so this is an opportune time for us. Is it guaranteed to happen for us? No. But, if there was a loud chorus of people saying, “This is the project to do. Now is the time.” (If the federal infrastructure bill passes) it (the Route 17 expansion) should be the first one done in New York State. They could do what they want in New York City, they have a lot of infrastructure issues too, but this is a region that is growing. You see massive commercial and residential development. Residential development in Southern Orange County is off the charts. You are going to need to match that with a transportation system that actually works. <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> When asked what the regional fallout might be if the Route 17 expansion project is not undertaken, the County Executive responded: “You are going to have Planning Boards that are going to say, ‘We love the project, but it is just not doable with the current infrastructure.’”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Home sales activity in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ region continued to be historically robust in the second quarter of this year, fueled by strong demand and a continued economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>All key data metrics throughout the region were significantly higher in the second quarter, with the exception of one—for sale inventory, which was down sharply in all markets with the exception of the Bronx. This lack of inventory has been a major contributing factor in the steep increase in home sales value and will likely have a hand in slowing sales activity down when rising prices and available product put downward pressure on sales volume.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HGAR_OneKey-MLS-2021-2nd-Quarter-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T<strong>he Second Quarter 2021 Residential Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx Counties</strong></a>” released recently by OneKeyMLS showed strong sales gains in all counties in the suburban markets of New York City. All counties posted double-digit sales gains as compared to 2019 second quarter sales, with Sullivan County leading the way with an astounding 56.83% increase; followed by Rockland County, which posted a 33.86% increase; Putnam County sales in the second quarter were 27.27% higher; Bronx County posted a 21.75% gain; Westchester registered a 16.25% spike and Orange County enjoyed a 13.70% rise in second sales volume as compared to two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note: <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/web-exclusive/home-sales-in-nyc-hudson-valley-region-continue-hot-streak-in-the-second-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full OneKey MLS Second Quarter 2021 Residential Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Bronx Counties” report and data.</a></strong></p>
<p>While second quarter 2021 sales volume was significantly higher than the 2020 second quarter, OneKey MLS officials noted that last year sales activity was suppressed due to restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to the OneKey MLS report, median sales price increased in every area and continues to exceed the “bubble” prices of the 2008-2009 market. The median sale price for a single-family residential unit in Orange County rose 20.8% to $360,000 (from $298,000 one year ago), exceeded by an increase of 31.4% in Sullivan County to $229,900 from $175,000 one year ago.</p>
<p>The median price for single-family houses in Westchester County, increased 17.6% to $835,000 from $710,000 last year. The median sale price for a single-family residence in Putnam County shot up by 23.3% to $442,000 (from $358,400) and Rockland County’s single-family median price rose by 15.8% to $550,000 (from $475,000) and Bronx County saw a 7.2% increase to $565,000 (from $527,000) as compared to the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>Sales of condominium units increased in in all counties with the exception of Sullivan) and co-op sales in Westchester and the Bronx counties continued to improve.</p>
<p>The median sale price for a condominium in Westchester rose 3.8% to $405,000 as compared to 2020. The median condo price in Putnam rose 28.6% to $283,000; condo prices in Rockland shot up 24% to $310,000; and Orange County condo prices increased 15.8% to $220,000. The condo median sale price in the Bronx fell 6.3% to $300,000 in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The median sale price of a co-op in Westchester was flat at $190,000 in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 12 months earlier, while the Bronx co-op median rose 10.8% in the second quarter of 2021 to $230,000.</p>
<p>Reaction to the latest sales and price data from the region was mostly positive, with most predicting continued heady sales activity, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors President Crystal Hawkins Syska said market conditions throughout the region continue to show a seller’s market, however, she noted that second quarter sales statistics really reflect activity generated earlier in the year.</p>
<p>“Right now, for the first time since we had this crazy market, I am seeing more price reductions starting to show up in different pockets and I am still seeing a major slowdown in co-op sales,” she said.</p>
<p>Syska, who is an Associate Broker with Keller Williams NY Realty of White Plains, added that the slowdown in co-ops is particularly prevalent in one-bedroom and studio units.</p>
<p>Noting that the median price of a single-family home in Westchester has shot up to $835,000, the sweet spot for the market appears to be in the $500,000 to $600,000, where the competition is heavy for those available homes, she noted.</p>
<p>Syska said that inventory is still low, but is hopeful that once homeowners read about market conditions and feel more confident about COVID vaccines and the ongoing economic recovery, they may begin to put their properties on the market in August and September.</p>
<p>She said she is concerned that the current escalation in home values will be a roadblock to some families to purchase homes in the region. In fact, she said that she already knows of some entry-level prospective buyers who have given up on the market at the moment.</p>
<p>According to Houlihan Lawrence’s second quarter residential report, the brokerage firm notes that the exodus of buyers looking to leave New York City to less congested communities, which had dominated sales activity in 2020, has lessened. However, the pent-up-demand still outweighs the supply. Listings declined in the 30%-40% range year-over-year in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties and pending sales increased anywhere from 25%-52%.</p>
<p>“While the current market is one of the best environments to list a home, buyers remain value conscious. Even in these circumstances, if a list price is perceived to be inflated, it will linger on the market until the price is perceived actionable,” said Liz Nunan, president of Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>Nunan added that while the lower and middle range priced homes have traditionally had higher demand, that is not always the case with the luxury segment. “In fact, there was an oversupply in luxury inventory in some areas for the past few years. Currently, most of our luxury markets have seen the most significant percentage increase in pending and closed sales, some in triple digits, and demand remains strong across the board,” she said.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence also reported that in every area north of New York City, the number of luxury sales was higher in the first half of 2021 versus the same period in 2019, indicating the COVID effect is still impacting the luxury markets.</p>
<p>The absorption rate of homes for sale north of New York City is strong, according to Houlihan Lawrence. Buyers are motivated and decisive due to limited supply, and competitive bidding is not uncommon. Approximately 30% of luxury sales closed over asking price in Westchester County since the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>“Some luxury homes are still sitting on the market. Sellers who want to capture the momentum are reducing their price to be more attractive to price-sensitive buyers,” said Anthony P. Cutugno, senior vice president, director of private brokerage at Houlihan Lawrence. “The duality of the market—competitive bidding alongside price-sensitive buyers—appears contradictory. However, price is always a primary consideration in real estate decision making. Value has to be displayed even when supply is tight, and often, multiple offers signal to a potential buyer that strong demand now may be a precursor to future strong demand as well.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TARRYTOWN—The planned expansion of Westchester County-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has exponentially increased and is now valued at $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>The firm, which is seeking approvals from the Town of Greenburgh for an expansion plan valued at $480 million, is now moving forward with a multi-year expansion that will approach nearly $2-billion. The Tarrytown-headquartered firm’s updated expansion plans were announced by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on July 15.</p>
<p>The company will expand its research, preclinical manufacturing and support facilities at the company&#8217;s Westchester County campus in Tarrytown and create 1,000 new full-time, high-skill jobs in the Mid-Hudson Region over the next five years. Gov. Cuomo said that in return, Empire State Development is offering the company up to $100 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits if its hiring goals are achieved. Regeneron considered several potential sites in the tri-state area before deciding to expand in the Mid-Hudson region, according to the governor’s announcement.</p>
<p>Regeneron intends to substantially expand its research and development capabilities in Tarrytown, which will include the addition of new preclinical manufacturing and process development suites, laboratories and office space. The project will encompass the design and construction and fit out of up to eight buildings, three parking garages and a central utility plant totaling approximately 900,000 square feet. Road infrastructure improvements will be necessary to support additional buildings at their existing Headquarters and R&amp;D campus. The project is planned to take place in two phases over six years.</p>
<p>The direct and indirect fiscal benefit to state and local government is estimated to be more than $283.3 million and the estimated economic benefit to New York is nearly $2 billion. Construction planning will begin this summer and project construction will be completed in 2027.</p>
<p>“New York is proud to be at the forefront of the life sciences industry and the home of global biotech leaders like Regeneron,” Gov. Cuomo said. “The continued growth of Regeneron here in New York is yet another indication that we are leading the way in the life sciences and attracting the jobs of tomorrow. Not only will this expansion further drive economic growth in the Mid-Hudson Region, but fuel lifesaving innovation and development that benefits the entire world.”</p>
<p>Regeneron President and Chief Executive Officer Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of continued and long-term investment in the biopharmaceutical industry, and Regeneron is proud to pursue life-changing science and technology from our labs and manufacturing facilities in New York State. In 2020 and 2021, the Regeneron team has worked tirelessly, bringing forward new treatments for people with COVID-19, Ebola, multiple forms of cancer and pediatric atopic dermatitis. As we expand our team and site, we look forward to bringing even more medical breakthroughs to patients in need.”</p>
<p>Regeneron had recently amended an earlier expansion plan on property in the Town of Greenburgh from approximately $149 million to $480 million. Greenburgh Town Supervisor Paul Feiner tells <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the proposal is nearing final approvals.</p>
<div id="attachment_37427" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37427" class="wp-image-37427" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/REGENERON-HQ.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-37427" class="wp-caption-text"><br /> Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is headquartered in Tarrytown at the former Landmark at Eastview complex.</p></div>
<p>Garrett Duquesne, commissioner of community development &amp; conservation for the Town of Greenburgh, stated that Regeneron’s expansion plan is before the Town Board, Planning Board, Zoning Board of Appeals. Decisions on the proposal are anticipated in August and September. Regeneron has previously secured approvals for an expansion of its campus of approximately 1 million square feet at 555 Saw Mill River Road. That project has yet to be constructed.</p>
<p>“We are very excited that Regeneron is expanding their Greenburgh campus- creating jobs, helping us with our tax base. It’s also great for property values—their future employees will want to live nearby. Many will purchase homes here,” Greenburgh Supervisor Feiner said.</p>
<p>On April 22, representatives of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. made a presentation to the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency on an amended expansion plan for property in the Town of Greenburgh.</p>
<p>Janet Giris, a partner with the law firm DelBello, Donnellan &amp; Weingarten, Wise &amp; Wiederkeher, LLP who represented Regeneron at the IDA session, noted that the new project is an expansion of its Parcel D project originally proposed in 2015 as a building not to exceed 192,000 square feet that secured Westchester IDA approval, but never moved forward.</p>
<p>“Recently, Regeneron has been reevaluating its long-term space needs and determined that the originally approved Building D no longer meets its needs,” she said.</p>
<p>Giris said that Regeneron plans to submit an amended incentives application with the IDA for its new project that would involve the construction of a new two-story, 207,000-square-foot building, along with a parking structure and other infrastructure that will increase the development cost of the project (including equipment) by approximately $331 million to $480 million. The original plan called for the construction of a building totaling approximately 128,000 square feet of mixed lab/office space.</p>
<p>In its presentation, Regeneron estimates that construction costs will total $310 million, design costs $21.7 million and FF&amp;E (furniture, fixtures and equipment) $148.9 million. The cost of the original project was estimated at $150 million. The firm estimated the tax savings it will secure will net approximately $7.7 million.</p>
<p>The new building will primarily house Regeneron’s pre-clinical manufacturing and process development operations. She reported that Regeneron recently applied to the Town of Greenburgh for amended land use approval on the Parcel D building.</p>
<p>According to a project timeline submitted to the IDA, Regeneron hopes to secure approvals from the Town of Greenburgh and necessary permits that would allow construction to begin sometime in the third or fourth quarter of this year with project completion slated for mid-2024.</p>
<p>To date, Regeneron has not appeared before the IDA since to discuss its amended plan. The next Westchester County IDA meeting is scheduled for Thursday, July 22. According to an agenda posted on its website, the IDA is expected to hear a cost benefit analysis of the Regeneron project.</p>
<p>Empire State Development Acting Commissioner and President and CEO-Designate Eric Gertler called Regeneron&#8217;s expansion “a game changer for the regional economy” that will “cement New York State as a world leader in the life sciences industry.”</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer added, “Congratulations to Regeneron and thank you to Empire State Development. Westchester County is continuing to lead the way in the biotech industry. Not only is our county becoming a central location for the industry, but the people working here are living here and raising their families here. This expansion will not only create jobs and inspire future generations interested in pursuing a biotech career to stay right here in Westchester.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is coming back to the Westchester IDA "very shortly" with a major expansion project at its headquarters complex.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Officials with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. told members of the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency this morning that it expects to come before the agency “very shortly” with a major new development project in the Town of Greenburgh.</p>
<p>Although Regeneron representatives did not provide any details on the new project, its representations at the session point to a parcel of land where the firm has previously secured approvals from the Town of Greenburgh for the construction of a group of buildings that could total approximately 1 million square feet at 555 Saw Mill River Road.</p>
<p>At the July 22 session, Janet Giris, a partner with the law firm DelBello, Donnellan &amp; Weingarten, Wise &amp; Wiederkeher, LLP and Dale Fanning, executive director-tax operations at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, when questioned by IDA members, promised that the company would be back before the IDA “as soon as possible” on the new development project. They also said that the company would soon be filing plans for a day care facility on its property with the Town of Mount Pleasant.</p>
<p>When asked when Regeneron might introduce the larger development project, which is owned by an entity of the company, Giris said, “As soon as we can.”</p>
<p>The Tarrytown-based firm is currently before the IDA concerning a project estimated to be valued at $480 million that involves the construction of a new two-story, 207,000-square-foot building, along with a parking structure and other infrastructure. That proposal is an amendment to a plan previously approved by the Westchester IDA known as the Parcel D project that significantly raises the level of investment by approximately $331 million to $480 million. The original plan called for the construction of a building totaling approximately 128,000 square feet of mixed lab/office space. The firm is now seeking a total of $7.7 million in sales tax exemptions in connection with this project from the IDA.</p>
<p>Giris and Fanning had no further comment on the company’s plans when questioned by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. The IDA heard a cost-benefit analysis presentation on the Regeneron project. The study estimates that the $480-million project will create approximately 1,624 jobs during the construction phase and 505 jobs once operational. Construction on the Parcel D project before the IDA is expected to begin later this year with move-in scheduled for mid 2024.</p>
<p>While no development cost for the new project is known, if the firm moved forward with its full 1-million-square-foot development potential, it would easily dwarf the nearly $500-million project currently being considered by the Westchester County IDA.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on July 16 that Regeneron has plans to spend approximately $1.8 billion on its Westchester County expansion plans. The governor noted that the firm had considered several other out-of-state sites before deciding on investing in the properties it owns in Greenburgh.</p>
<p>Westchester County IDA Chairman Joan McDonald thanked Regeneron for remaining in New York State and promised the county would help the firm in its recruitment efforts in connection with its expansion program.</p>
<p>In the governor’s announcement last week, state officials noted that Regeneron intends to substantially expand its research and development capabilities in Tarrytown, which will include the addition of new preclinical manufacturing and process development suites, laboratories and office space. The project will encompass the design and construction and fit out of up to eight buildings, three parking garages and a central utility plant totaling approximately 900,000 square feet. Road infrastructure improvements will be necessary to support additional buildings at their existing headquarters and R&amp;D campus. The project is planned to take place in two phases over six years.</p>
<p>The company will expand its research, preclinical manufacturing and support facilities at the company’s Westchester County campus and create 1,000 new full-time, high-skill jobs in the Mid-Hudson region over the next five years. Gov. Cuomo said that in return, Empire State Development is offering the company up to $100 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits if its hiring goals are achieved.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[ New York is only one of two states that has not released its COVID rental funding assistance to tenants and landlords.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It is now the end of July, and the COVID rental assistance has not yet been processed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. To date, New York is only one of two states that has not released its COVID rental funding assistance to tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>This has exacerbated an already dire situation for those tenants unable to pay their rent and for landlords who in turn lack the rental income to pay for taxes, maintenance and meet their mortgage commitments.</p>
<p>The application process, and the website have been riddled with errors despite the state having had the better part of six months to prepare for this. It was repeatedly stated by members of both parties that rental aid would be included in the relief packages that have passed Congress. The state is also flush with record cash since having received state and local aid from the federal coronavirus relief package this year. The state has also collected considerably more tax revenue than anticipated due to the stimulus payments that have gone out to people in the form of relief checks.</p>
<p>It is also critical that this money gets out the “door” as soon as possible for another reason. If the money is not used for its intended purpose within a certain time frame it then gets returned to the federal government for reallocation. Often federal assistance comes with a use it or lose it mandate. It would be unfortunate if this sorely needed aid were to go to waste.</p>
<p>Please respond to the <a href="https://www.hgar.com/about-us/advocacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSAR Call for Action</a> that has been posted on Facebook, the website and emailed to HGAR members.</p>
<p>Finally, please <a href="https://www.hgar.com/about-us/advocacy/rpac-invest-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invest in RPAC</a>. It is critical that we support RPAC at a time when our industry is facing political threats at the state and federal level. Thanks to your RPAC contributions we stopped “Good Cause Eviction” and got pandemic unemployment insurance passed for independent contractors. Stay tuned for updates on this story.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The ownership of Empire City Casino in Yonkers is being acquired by New York City-based gaming, hospitality and entertainment REIT VICI Properties Inc. in a deal valued at $17.2 billion.</p>
<p>VICI Properties reported that it had entered into a definitive agreement (Master Transaction Agreement) with MGM Growth Properties LLC and MGM Resorts International (MGM Growth Properties controlling shareholder) whereby VICI Properties will acquire MGP for total consideration of $17.2 billion, inclusive of the assumption of approximately $5.7 billion of debt. Upon completion of the merger, which is expected in the first half of 2022, VICI will have an estimated enterprise value of $45 billion.</p>
<p>Among MGM Properties holdings that will change hands when the deal closes includes <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/commercial/empire-city-casino-changes-hands-to-mgm-resorts-in-850m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Empire City Casino in Yonkers</strong></a> and Yonkers Raceway, which it acquired from the Rooney family in January 2019 for $850 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Empire City Casino and a host of area business and civic organizations lobbied the Cuomo Administration to speed up the approval process to award full casino gaming licenses to downstate New York. Representatives of MGM Resorts promised significant capital investment in the property valued at approximately $400 million if it secured the full gaming license from New York State.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each Class A share of MGP. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43.00 per share of MGP Class A shares based on VICI’s trailing five-day volume weighted average price of $31.47 as of July 30, 2021 and represents a 15.9% premium to MGP’s closing stock price on Aug. 3, 2021. MGM Resorts will receive $43.00 per unit in cash for the redemption of the majority of its MGP Operating Partnership units that it holds for total cash consideration of approximately $4.4 billion and will also retain approximately 12 million units in a newly formed operating partnership of VICI Properties. The MGP Class B share that is held by MGM Resorts will be cancelled and cease to exist, the company stated.</p>
<p>VICI Properties will also enter into an amended and restated triple-net master lease with MGM Resorts. The lease will have an initial total annual rent of $860.0 million, inclusive of MGP’s pending acquisition of MGM Springfield, and an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year tenant renewal options. Rent under the amended and restated master lease will escalate at a rate of 2.0% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter at the greater of 2.0% per annum or the consumer price index, subject to a 3.0% cap.</p>
<p>Additionally, VICI will retain MGP’s existing 50.1% ownership stake in the joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., which owns the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay. The BREIT JV lease will remain unchanged and provides for current annual base rent of approximately $298 million and an initial term of 30 years, with two 10-year tenant renewal options. Rent under the BREIT JV lease escalates at a rate of 2.0% per annum for the first 15 years and thereafter at the greater of 2.0% per annum or CPI, subject to a 3.0% cap. On a combined basis, the MGM master lease and BREIT JV lease will deliver initial attributable rent to VICI of approximately $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>VICI Properties secured a $9.3 billion financing commitment from Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Citibank in connection with the deal. The transaction was approved by the Board of Directors of each of MGM Resorts, MGM Growth Properties and VICI Properties (and, in the case of MGP, the Conflicts Committee).</p>
<p>VICI Properties’ current portfolio consists of 28 gaming facilities comprising more than 47 million square feet and features approximately 17,800 hotel rooms and more than 200 restaurants, bars, nightclubs and sportsbooks. Its properties are leased to industry leading gaming and hospitality operators, including Caesars Entertainment, Inc., Century Casinos, Inc., Hard Rock International Inc., JACK Entertainment LLC and Penn National Gaming, Inc. VICI Properties also has an investment in the Chelsea Piers, New York facility and owns four championship golf courses and 34 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>MGM Growth Properties, together with its joint venture, currently owns a portfolio of 12 properties, consisting of premier destination resorts in Las Vegas and elsewhere across the United States, MGM Northfield Park in Northfield, OH, Empire Resort Casino in Yonkers, as well as a retail and entertainment district, The Park in Las Vegas. As of Dec. 31, 2020, MGP&#8217;s portfolio of destination resorts, the Park, Empire Resort Casino, and MGM Northfield Park collectively comprised approximately 32,400 hotel rooms, 1.5 million casino square footage, and 3.6 million convention square footage. The MGM Resorts portfolio encompasses 31 unique hotel and gaming destinations globally, including some of the most recognizable resort brands in the industry.</p>
<p>“Through this transformative strategic acquisition, we are merging MGP’s best-in-class portfolio into VICI’s best-in-class management and governance platform, creating the premier gaming, entertainment and leisure REIT in America,” said Ed Pitoniak, CEO of VICI Properties.</p>
<p>“After many years of growing both of our portfolios, combining them into one company will generate the best results for the shareholders of both companies,” said James Stewart, CEO of MGP. “The combined company will create a superior platform for delivering exceptional returns to MGP’s existing shareholders, by improving diversification, increasing scale, lowering cost of capital and benefiting from future growth.”</p>
<p>Bill Hornbuckle, CEO and president of MGM Resorts, added, “This transaction unlocks the significant real estate value of our assets, enhances our financial flexibility and strengthens our ability to execute key growth initiatives. We look forward to our long-term partnership with VICI.”</p>
<p>Among some of the benefits of the deal cited by VICI Properties include: enhancing its portfolio quality, size, and scale at significant discount to replacement cost. VICI Properties will add 15 Class A entertainment resort properties spread across nine regions comprising 33,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of meeting and convention space and hundreds of food, beverage and entertainment venues to its portfolio at an estimated 30% to 40% discount to replacement cost. Following the transaction, approximately 55% of VICI’s rent base will be generated by market-leading Regional properties while the remaining 45% will come from properties on the Las Vegas Strip</p>
<p>The firm also said the deal will significantly diversify its tenant base: Upon closing, VICI Properties’ top tenant concentration will be reduced to ~41% (from 84% currently) while 84% of VICI Properties’ rent roll will be derived from S&amp;P 500 tenants with a track record of having paid 100% of rent, on time and in cash throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

While he said that there may be some older residents who are deciding to move to warmer climates, the overall Westchester County reside]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS— <a href="https://youtu.be/x3KSX8h5F9k">At a press conference yesterday afternoon,</a> Westchester County Executive George Latimer attempted to dispel the online myth that many people are fleeing the county. To prove his point, he enlisted key representatives of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors who, armed with the latest sales data from OneKey MLS, noted that demand from buyers from inside and outside the county is very strong with no sign of letting up.</p>
<div id="attachment_37616" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37616" class="wp-image-37616" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CE-George-Lattimer.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-37616" class="wp-caption-text">Westchester County Executive, George Latimer</p></div>
<p>“There are narratives out there in the community, based on sometimes individual experiences, that there are people leaving Westchester in droves,” Latimer said. While he said that there may be some older residents who are deciding to move to warmer climates, the overall Westchester County residential market “is not just okay, it’s extremely healthy.”</p>
<p>Also speaking at the press conference were: HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska, HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty and Legislative Committee Co-Chair Leah Caro.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Haggerty noted that the county’s housing market has experienced a “dramatic bounce back” from the shutdown imposed in response to COVID-19 back in March 2020. Haggerty described the level of residential sales activity in Westchester County in the second quarter as “staggering.” One of the key factors that has fueled the strong housing market has been low lending rates, he related.</p>
<p>He noted that comparing 2021 sales to 2020 sales (that took place during the shutdown or shortly after COVID restrictions were lifted) would not offer a true picture of the current market. However, in comparing sales activity in the second quarter 2021 market to the pre-COVID 2019 second quarter, single-family home sales have increased 34.5%. Due in part to low inventory, the median sale price of a single-family home in Westchester rose 17.7% to $835,500.</p>
<div id="attachment_37617" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37617" class="wp-image-37617" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crystal.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-37617" class="wp-caption-text">HGAR President, Crystal Hawkins-Syska</p></div>
<p>Another sign of the strong housing market has been the turnaround of the luxury Northeastern section of the Westchester County market (Bedford, Pound Ridge, Lewisboro, North Salem), which until recently had not fully recovered from the housing downturn in 2008. Home sales in the Northern Westchester in the second quarter of 2021 have risen 41% as compared to 2020 and registered a 56% increase from 2019 sales in that market.</p>
<p>Haggerty said that COVID has also changed buying habits. Prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus last year, many buyers were searching for smaller properties near mass transit centers. An emerging buying trend in the COVID-era has been buyers looking for larger properties that do not have to be located near train stations.</p>
<p>The HGAR CEO said he is very bullish on the market going forward. “I think this recovery is sustainable,” Haggerty said. “Right now, we are not seeing any signs of a slowdown and I think it will continue into 2022.”</p>
<p>Caro, who is president and principal broker of Park Sterling Realty in Bronxville, said that while there are some that are relocating out of Westchester due to lifestyle choices, “I can happily report that a good number of people we are buying and selling with are moving within Westchester County.”</p>
<p>She also added that the county has seen a significant number of New York City residents that have purchased housing in Westchester County and that overall demand is outpacing the available supply in the county.</p>
<p>She agreed with Haggerty that the current housing sales boom is sustainable.</p>
<p>“This is not an artificial boom,” she said. Caro also said that the market is not facing a “bubble” that took place in 2008-2009. She said that in 2008-2009, the housing “bubble” was brought on by “sketchy mortgage products and Wall Street shenanigans” and the increase in home values today is being driven by different factors—mainly low inventory and strong demand.</p>
<div id="attachment_37623" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37623" class="wp-image-37623" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Richard-Haggerty.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-37623" class="wp-caption-text">HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty</p></div>
<p>HGAR President Syska, who is an Associate Broker with Keller Williams NY Realty of White Plains, said the county has enjoyed a rush of New York City residents moving to the county. In addition, a trend she is seeing at the moment is more “multigenerational living” where buyers are seeking larger homes to accommodate older children and or parents.</p>
<p>Even though some of the county’s older homeowners have chosen to leave (Westchester County), Syska has noticed a significant number have chosen to remain in the county.</p>
<p>“So, what I anticipate is that we might see more families looking for variances and maybe some innovation in terms of zoning because Mom and Dad and their children and maybe grandchildren are going to look to live together,” she said.</p>
<p>After the HGAR presentations, County Executive Latimer stressed that the housing and overall business climate in Westchester are very healthy “Westchester County is not hemorrhaging people,” Latimer said, noting that in addition to the housing market, other sectors of the county’s economy are also rebounding from the pandemic.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Based in part on the strong advocacy of our association and its Realtor members, on Monday, June 28, 2021, the Westchester County Board of Legislators voted 15-2 to pass an amendment to strengthen the Westchester Co-Op Disclosure Law. It was signed into law by County Executive George Latimer that same day. The new law took effect on Aug. 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Originally passed in 2018 in an effort to curb discrimination against applicants for co-ops, the law initially required co-operative boards to provide notice to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission relating to the rejection of applicants. With the passage of the new amendment, not only must co-operative boards undergo fair housing training, but they now have additional disclosure and notice requirements and they are to provide increased transparency regarding the reasoning for any co-op application rejection.</p>
<p><strong>New Application Transparency Rules and Notice</strong></p>
<p>Starting Aug. 1, 2021, co-op boards are to provide a reason when they deny an applicant’s purchase of a unit. It also requires boards to provide a notice of rejection to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission within a specified period of time of notifying prospective buyers of a denial. Additionally, it mandates disclosure of minimum financial requirements to potential buyers before they apply to purchase a unit. Here’s a breakdown of the new regulations:</p>
<p>• Within 15 days of the receipt of an application, the co-op board must either acknowledge that it received a complete application, or notify the applicant of any defect in the application.</p>
<p>• If there is a defect, within 15 days of the receipt of the corrected application the co-op board must either acknowledge that is has received a complete application, or they must notify the applicant of any further defects.</p>
<p>• Within 60 days of receipt of a complete application, the co-op board must approve or deny the application, and provide written notice. They must also provide written notice to the Westchester County Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>This notice, promulgated by the Executive Director of the Human Rights Commission, is published on the Human Rights Commission website and can be found by clicking on the following link:<strong> <a href="https://humanrights.westchestergov.com/images/stories/pdfs/2021coopnotice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HRC Model Rejection Form</a></strong></p>
<p>The completed form must be transmitted to the Human Rights Commission within 15 days of the notice being provided to the prospective purchaser.</p>
<p><strong>New Disclosure of Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>In addition to providing notice of application rejections, co-op boards must now also disclose any minimum financial qualifications that a prospective purchaser must meet to qualify to purchase a unit. If a co-operative housing corporation does not have any stated mandatory minimum financial qualifications, they must at least provide their preferred minimum income, total assets, credit score, preferred maximum debt-to-income ratio and percentage of purchase price being financed.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Housing Training</strong></p>
<p>All members of a co-op board are required to undergo fair housing training. Persons who are presently members of co-op boards or who become members within the first seven months of the enacting of this law shall receive two hours fair housing training as soon as practicable, but no later than nine months after the date that this law was enacted. This training must be performed every two years. The law adds that any new member of the board must have a minimum of two hours of fair housing training within 60 days of becoming a board member.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission will establish and publish on its website the minimum requirements for this training, which will include discussion of local, state and federal discrimination law and related agencies, discussion of protected classes under these laws, and their obligations as members of the co-op board to adhere to these laws while evaluating applicants, making reasonable accommodations and other similar scenarios. As of the time of this publication, the requirements have yet to be published.</p>
<p><strong>Punishment/Fines</strong></p>
<p>Non-compliance with any of the requirements set forth in this new law shall be punishable by a fine of $1,000 for the first offense, $1,500 for the second offense and $2,000 for the third and any subsequent offense. Any such violation must be brought within one year of the violation, except that any violation initiated by the Executive Director of the Human Rights Commission shall be brought within one year of when the Human Rights Commission first learned of the violation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Through the efforts of this association and you, Realtors have taken a giant step forward in the creation of impactful fair housing laws. Transparency is paramount in rooting out discrimination and your efforts are changing the landscape and leveling the playing field. Please make sure that you share this information with your clients. Also, please take care that if your client is rejected from a co-op op board that you follow up with the Human Rights Commission to verify that the board is in compliance with the notice requirement for all co-op rejections.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3>Eviction Moratorium Saga Continues, Cold Calling Ban, Co-Op Transparency Law in Effect</h3>
<p>The tenant eviction moratorium has gone back and forth. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional, but also ruled that it could remain in place until it expired in July. Most recently, based on pressures from tenant advocacy groups, the administration extended it again for areas with high COVID transmissibility.</p>
<p>More than $40 billion has already been appropriated in COVID relief bills for tenants and landlords. It has been left to the individual states to administer and disburse the funds and states, most notably New York State, have been slow to get the funds distributed. The National Association of Realtors has joined in a lawsuit to have the current moratorium thrown out based on the court’s original determination.</p>
<p>An infrastructure deal with bipartisan support has been agreed to. It will go through the Senate first and then the House of Representatives. It would add $256 billion to the deficit over 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill invests in roads, bridges, highways, trains, broadband, and other hard infrastructure items. This would be the first true infrastructure bill in well over a decade.</p>
<p>At the state level, NYSAR has sent out a call for action that urges Governor Cuomo to sign a repeal of the “cold calling ban.” The ban was reinstated as a result of Governor Cuomo extending the gun violence emergency and has been in effect since the start of COVID. The ban can hamper a business model. Cold calling is a safe activity and obviously is unrelated to gun violence. The ban unfairly targets Realtors and impedes their ability to conduct their normal course of business.</p>
<p>The co-op law in Westchester County went into effect on August 1st. Anyone can go to the Human Rights Commission website to view the form that the co-op board must fill out if they reject a prospective purchaser. The form lists many financial reasons for a board to reject someone. The hope is that the board will provide more specific information with this new form. The Human Rights Commission did a good job in getting a form out in a timely manner. The key now, is to continue to get the word out to our members, and other co-op board participants regarding compliance with this new law. Stay tuned for updates on these legislative and regulation issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—After his attorney provided a detailed point-by-point rebuttal of allegations by 11 women of improper conduct and sexual harassment, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, somewhat surprisingly, announced he would resign from office effective in 14 days (Aug. 24).</p>
<p>While he said that his instinct is to fight the charges because he felt they were politically motivated, the governor noted the scandal had become a distraction. “Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,” the governor said. “And therefore, that’s what I’ll do.” He said that to effectuate a smooth transition, his resignation would take effect in 14 days.</p>
<p>At press time it is not known if the State Assembly will move forward with impeachment proceedings, however, the governor’s announcement ensures he will not complete his third term and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will take over as governor later this month and when sworn in will become the first woman governor in the history of New York State.</p>
<p>He characterized the Lieutenant Governor as “smart and competent” and said the 14 days would be used to facilitate a seamless transition.</p>
<p>State political leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Andrew Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker James Heastie had called for the governor to resign after the release of the 165-page report on the sexual harassment allegations by the New York State Attorney General’s office. U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand have also called for the governor to resign, as had President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>On August 3, New York State Attorney General Letitia James released the report into the multiple allegations of sexual harassment by New York Gov. Cuomo that concluded the governor did sexually harass multiple women—including former and current state employees — by engaging in unwanted groping, kissing, and hugging, and making inappropriate comments. Further, the governor and his senior staff took actions to retaliate against at least one former employee for coming forward with her story. Finally, the Executive Chamber fostered a “toxic” workplace that enabled “harassment to occur and created a hostile work environment.” The investigators find that Governor Cuomo’s actions and those of the Executive Chamber violated multiple state and federal laws, as well as the Executive Chamber’s own written policies.</p>
<p>The governor at the press briefing in New York City apologized if he offended any of the 11 women, but denied touching or engaging in any harassing behavior. He said he resigned in order to “do the right thing” for the people of New York.</p>
<p>“In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” Gov. Cuomo said. However, he added that he has since realized that the lines have been redrawn.</p>
<p>Prior to the press conference, Gov. Cuomo’s personal attorney Rita Glavin in a televised briefing, categorically denied the governor harassed any of the 11 women.</p>
<p>Since the governor’s resignation, a host of federal, state and local officials have released statements:</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer</strong></p>
<p>“I want to commend the brave women who stepped forward and courageously told their stories. There is no place for sexual harassment, and today’s announcement by Governor Cuomo to resign was the right decision for the good of the people of New York. I have full confidence that Lt. Governor Hochul will establish a professional and capable administration. I have spoken with Lt. Governor Hochul and look forward to working together to help the people of New York.”</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand</strong></p>
<p>“First and foremost, I want to thank the incredibly courageous women who came forward and shared their stories. They are the true public servants here. New York now has a chance to move forward and build a new culture of leadership. Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul is an exceptional public servant and will be an excellent governor. I look forward to working together to continue serving the people of our great state.”</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Governor Cuomo&#8217;s decision to step down. It is the right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers.<br />
As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State’s 57th Governor.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>New York State Attorney General Letitia James</strong></p>
<p>“Today closes a sad chapter for all of New York, but it’s an important step towards justice. I thank Governor Cuomo for his contributions to our state. The ascension of our Lieutenant Governor, Kathy Hochul, will help New York enter a new day. We must continue to build on the progress already made and improve the lives of New Yorkers in every corner of the state. I know our state is in good hands with Lieutenant Governor Hochul at the helm, and I look forward to continuing to work with her.”</p>
<p><strong>NY State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins</strong></p>
<p>“Today is a somber day for the state of New York, but one that demonstrates our ability to build a more accountable system of government. Governor Cuomo’s resignation opens the door to a restorative future. We all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the courageous women who came forward and helped pave the way for safer and more inclusive workspaces. Working with Governor Kathy Hochul, the first woman Governor of New York State, we will continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic, rebuild our economy and face our challenges standing together. Governor Hochul is a dedicated leader, and united, we will get the people’s work done.”</p>
<p><strong>NY State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie</strong></p>
<p>“This has been a tragic chapter in our state&#8217;s history. Governor Cuomo&#8217;s resignation is the right decision. The brave women who stepped forward were heard. Everyone deserves to work in a harassment free environment. I have spoken with Lieutenant Governor Hochul and I look forward to working with her.”</p>
<p><strong>Westchester County Executive George Latimer</strong></p>
<p>“Westchester County, and my administration, stand ready to work with incoming Governor Kathy Hochul when she assumes the governorship later this month. For years, incoming Governor Hochul has been a welcomed presence in Westchester County. She is well qualified to lead New York State in this immediate crisis. Also, for all New Yorkers, let us recognize this historic moment—that New York will for the first time in our history have a female Governor. Times have changed—as they should. We welcome incoming Governor Hochul, and look forward to cooperation between Westchester County and New York State in moving together in the right direction.”</p>
<p><strong>Rockland County Executive Ed Day</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement of Governor Cuomo’s resignation is extremely welcome and long overdue news. It has been clear for some time that the Governor’s abusive and inappropriate behavior is unacceptable and his continued presence in the Governor’s Mansion was an insult to the women he harassed and the people of New York. I look forward to working with Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul as she serves out the remainder of this term and becomes the first woman to serve as Governor of New York. I am hopeful that this change in leadership will serve us well over the next year and a half and allow for real change in Albany so that employees across our state are treated with the respect that each and every one of us deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio</strong></p>
<p>“Make no mistake, this is the result of survivors bravely telling their stories. It was past time for Andrew Cuomo to resign and it’s for the good of all New York.”</p>
<p><strong>Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It is a historic day in our state’s history—we open a new chapter, welcoming New York’s first female Governor. I look forward to working with incoming Governor Kathy Hochul and building on the progress New York has made. Governor Hochul is an experienced leader and should be well equipped to lead New York through the challenges that lay ahead, and working with her, we will champion the issues facing our communities.”</p>
<p><strong>White Plains Mayor Tom Roach</strong></p>
<p>“The conduct of the governor as detailed in the Attorney General’s report has no place in our society, much less at the highest level of government in New York State. His resignation represents an affirmation of the women who bravely spoke up and called out the governor’s behavior. I have worked with Lt. Governor Hochul throughout her tenure and have found her to be smart, dedicated, and tireless. She has traveled the length and breadth of New York, regularly meeting and talking firsthand with residents, business owners, and local government officials on issues of concern to us all. Our state will be in good hands under her leadership.”</p>
<p><strong>State Senator Pete Harckham</strong></p>
<p>“The resignation of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo was necessary to allow state governance to proceed, and I am grateful for this decision. Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul will lead New York State admirably, and I wish her the best in the months ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>State Assemblymember Amy Paulin</strong></p>
<p>“Governor Cuomo’s decision to resign is for the good of New York. Over the past decade, the work done by Governor Cuomo has in many ways improved the lives of New Yorkers, but the evidence has made it clear that he cannot continue in office. The governor’s resignation is a necessary step that will allow the state government to function effectively, and it sets the precedent that sexual harassment will not be tolerated at any level. This ends a sordid chapter in New York’s history, but I hope it opens a new one, in which people in positions of power finally understand that sexual harassment is not okay and has profound consequences. What Andrew Cuomo did to 11 women is still happening in our society. So, if this resignation leads to more abusers thinking twice, and to more victims deciding to fight back, then New York will be the better for it. I would like to thank the women who came forward and shared their stories. Their bravery will not be forgotten. When she is sworn in, Kathy Hochul will be the first woman to hold the office of Governor of New York. She is capable and prepared to take the position, and I look forward to working with her office to help the people of this state.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Assemblymember Jonathan Jacobson</strong></p>
<p>“Governor Cuomo&#8217;s announcement that he is stepping down is the right one for New York. He no longer has the trust necessary to govern effectively. I have known Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul for many years and have full confidence in her ability to lead the state. I look forward to working with her.”</p>
<p><strong>Assemblymember Mike Lawler</strong></p>
<p>“It&#8217;s past due time that Andrew Cuomo resigned from office after 11 years of bullying, thuggery, and now, predatory sexual behavior. His conduct was completely and totally unbecoming of the office of Governor. I&#8217;m glad he showed one little moniker of decency by resigning and sparing the people of New York an expensive and prolonged impeachment process. I look forward to working with Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul to serve the people of New York State and Rockland County with dignity, honor and decency.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Business Council of Westchester</strong></p>
<p>“The Business Council of Westchester has enjoyed a long and successful collaborative working relationship with Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul. We have full confidence in her abilities to lead the state and look forward to working with her and her administration. New York State still faces many economic challenges as we continue to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. We stand ready to work closely with her as she continues to promote economic development, job creation and diversity initiatives in Westchester and across the state.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Recent ransomware attacks and major hacks have thrust into the spotlight the importance of businesses, including those in the real estate industry, having the necessary protocols and protections in place to protect themselves and their clients from cybercriminals]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On June 24th, 2021, our nation witnessed one of the deadliest and most tragic building collapses in its history. It sadly claimed the lives of 98 unsuspecting and innocent residents. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.</p>
<p>Since that sad day, information has continued to come to light in the news regarding the horrific structural conditions of the condominium and the documented history of the complaints relating to those conditions. A tragic event such as this serves as a reminder to all real estate professionals (attorneys, real estate agents, management agents, etc.), and to those individuals who are interested in purchasing a condominium unit or cooperative apartment (the “unit”), of the critical importance of conducting all of the necessary due diligence and physical inspections even when purchasing a condominium or cooperative apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Buying a Condo or Co-op, Do You Need an Inspection?</strong></p>
<p>It is not uncommon for real estate agents and attorneys to advise their purchaser clients to waive their inspection rights when the purchase of such a unit is involved. A common rationale for advising against having an inspection conducted is that other than the limited items contained within the confines of the walls of the unit, the condominium or cooperative corporation is responsible for most of the structural elements, as well as the electrical and plumbing systems throughout the building or condominium. Purchasers are commonly told that purchasing a unit is different from purchasing a free-standing, single-family residence, and hiring a home inspection company or engineer to inspect a unit is not necessary or a waste of money.</p>
<p>In fact, and especially after the horrific condominium building collapse in Florida, the exact opposite is true. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that real estate agents and real estate attorneys advise their purchaser clients to conduct physical inspections of not only the unit, but also of the systems of the building and condominium’s common elements, to the furthest extent permitted by the condominium or cooperative corporation. While some cooperative corporations and condominiums may limit the extent to which common elements and other building systems may be inspected, inspectors may be able to visually inspect those areas that are accessible to them. Considering the tragic events of June 24, purchasers and their agents should request express permission to have their inspection company inspect other parts of the building, as well as the unit itself.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Additional Due Diligence:</strong><br />
<strong> Review of Minutes, Financial Statements, Other Records</strong></p>
<p>When a purchaser is buying a co-op or condominium unit, it is important that the purchaser and the purchaser’s attorney review the following: (1) the previous two to three years’ (or more, if available) financial statements, minutes of the cooperative corporation’s board meetings or the condominium’s board meetings from the past two-to-four years (at the least), the co-op’s or condominium’s rules and regulations, the Offering Plan (and any amendments), as well as the By-laws and any amendments thereto.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that most of these documents, except for the minutes (which many times will need to be reviewed at the management agent’s office in person), be obtained from the seller and/or the management company by the real estate agent prior to or immediately after listing the unit for sale. This will greatly speed up the contract preparation and due diligence process. If all of these documents are obtained and provided to the seller’s attorney, who in turn will provide them to the purchaser’s attorney, the contract review and due diligence process will be reduced by several days.</p>
<p><strong>Review of the Co-op’s and Condo’s Board Minutes</strong></p>
<p>In New York City, it is a common occurrence for the purchaser or purchaser’s attorney to review the minutes of the board meetings before entering into contract. Unfortunately, it is a rarer occurrence in areas outside of New York City, such as Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Long Island, Orange County, and other areas. In these areas, it just has not been a custom for agents or attorneys to advise their purchaser clients to review the minutes. However, notwithstanding this custom, it is important that both real estate agents and attorneys strongly advise and recommend to their clients that the minutes be reviewed either prior to entering into contract or that a contingency period be included in the contract to allow for review after a contract execution. Since most seller’s attorneys are reluctant to include any review or inspection contingencies in the contract, this will usually have to be done prior to signing the contract of sale.</p>
<p>Normally, the attorneys who offer this service to their clients will charge an additional fee to do so. Many times, due to the cost, purchasers unwisely elect to waive their right to have their attorney review the minutes, or they simply choose not to review the minutes themselves because it could jeopardize or delay the transaction. Common remarks are: “Do we really have to review the minutes?”, “There isn’t going to be anything in the minutes that will affect the deal, is there?” or “I don’t want to lose the deal.” A purchaser, however, should never waive the right to review the minutes, and if the purchaser does so, the attorney should document this in writing.</p>
<p>The minutes often provide invaluable and critical information relating to the condition of the building and building systems, contemplated renovations, past or pending lawsuits, existing issues with tenants, the existence of pest, bedbug, rodent or other infestation problem, noise issues, issues with odors (e.g., restaurants or other nearby businesses), and common charge increases and the imposition of other assessments. If, for example, there were complaints or issues memorialized in the minutes of the Surfside Condominium over the years relating to the structural integrity of the building, upon review of such information, a purchaser may have decided not to purchase a unit in the building.</p>
<p>As a best practice, real estate agents, when representing a client interested in purchasing a condo or co-op unit, should at the initial stages of representation, inform their clients about their right to review the minutes and that once they find an apartment, they should discuss this with their counsel. It would also be a good idea for the agent to ask the condominium or co-op management agent about the review process in advance so that there is no delay. Normally, an appointment must be made to review the minutes. Most condominiums and cooperative corporations do not allow the minutes to be emailed, and therefore, the attorney and/or purchaser will be required to review the minutes at the office of the management agent. They usually will not allow the minutes to be copied. Therefore, knowing the process and procedures in advance can save valuable time.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Reviewing Financial Statements</strong></p>
<p>Another important item that should be reviewed as part of the due diligence process is the condominium’s or co-op’s annual financial statements, which are customarily prepared by an independent, certified public accountant, and which are usually audited. At the very least, it recommended that the last two years of financial statements be reviewed by the purchaser or the purchaser’s accountant. The attorneys will usually review the financial statements as well to see if there are any items of significance in the notes to the financial statements referencing items such as existing lawsuits, planned renovations, major anticipated capital expenditures, and other items, which could affect the future financial stability of the condominium or co-op, and the potential for increases in the monthly maintenance or common charges, as well as the likelihood of additional monthly assessments in the future.</p>
<p>A review of the financial statements is extremely important. Most financial statements cover a two-year period. It is important to note that since most financial statements are usually not ready until six months after the end of a calendar year, a purchaser may not be able to review and assess the current financial condition of a particular condo or co-op depending on when the transaction is occurring. Sometimes, a co-op or condominium may be able to provide unaudited or preliminary financial statements, profit and loss statements, or even balance sheets, if requested, but this is not common. A purchaser, therefore, may only be able to review and rely on the previous years’ financial statements. It is also recommended that a purchaser or purchaser’s agent or attorney request information relating to the amounts of the common charges and assessments for previous years so one can review and compare the historic charges to the current charges.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Reviewing the By-Laws,</strong><br />
<strong> Rules and Regulations and Offering Plans</strong></p>
<p>Additional documents that should be reviewed very carefully are the latest By-laws, Rules and Regulations and the Offering Plan for the condominium or co-op. Many times, purchasers would like to rent the unit they are purchasing or would like to have pets reside with them in the unit. Reviewing the most current By-laws and Rules and Regulations will provide a purchaser with crucial information such as, for example, whether pets are allowed, or if rentals are permitted. If a rental of the unit is not permitted and the client is purchasing the unit for investment purposes, then the client needs to be aware of this and look for another unit. It is important to note that once the contract is signed, the purchaser will not be permitted to cancel the transaction or get out of the contract.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Offering Plan is also very important. Normally, most purchasers and even attorneys elect not to review the Offering Plan. However, the Offering Plan usually contains important information as to the original formation of the condominium or co-op and also contains the original floor plans of each of the units, the number of shares allocated to each unit, whether the units come with storage areas, garages and/or assigned parking spaces. These are all important items that will assist the purchaser and attorney. For example, by simply reviewing the original floor plans contained in the Offering Plan, a purchaser and the purchaser’s agents (attorneys and real estate agents) will be able to ascertain whether any renovations or improvements were made to the unit. In turn, this will allow for an inquiry to be made to the seller’s counsel by the purchaser’s attorney as to whether the renovations or improvements were made with the approval of the condominium or co-op and whether the appropriate municipal approvals were obtained.</p>
<p><strong>The Current State of the Market: Low Inventory,</strong><br />
<strong> Bidding Wars, Waiving Important Due Diligence</strong></p>
<p>In the current real estate market, and especially during the past year, inventory has continued to decline (reaching critically low levels) and the demand for housing has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, because of current market conditions, purchasers are being forced to do things they would not ordinarily do. Each property has multiple offers and buyers are increasing their bids drastically just so that their offer is accepted. Many properties are selling above their listing prices. Unfortunately, this causes increasing pressure for purchasers to waive mortgage contingencies, inspections, due diligence, and to agree to contract terms that could cause harm to purchasers. Purchasing a home is one of the largest financial transactions for an individual and no matter the market conditions, one should never rush into any such transaction or waive important rights in doing so.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul in a press conference yesterday stressed that she will be ready to take over as the 57th governor of New York when she takes the oath of office later this month.</p>
<p>Hochul, who is scheduled to take over as governor on Aug. 24, stressed, “I am ready for this,” and later assured New Yorkers: “I will fight like hell for you every single day, like I’ve always done and always will.”</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Aug. 10 that he would resign from office in two weeks after the New York State Attorney General’s report on sexual harassment allegations against the governor was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Hochul, who has served for the past seven years as lieutenant governor, said that she would detail her “vision” for the state in an address shortly after she takes office. However, she did say that the number one priority of her administration will be to deal with COVID-19. Hochul said that she would also continue the ongoing investment in “rebuilding the great State of New York.”</p>
<p>Hochul, who holds a bachelor’s degree from Syracuse University and a JD from Catholic University, served in the U.S. Congress from 2011 to 2013 representing the 26th Congressional District. She has served as Lieutenant Governor under current Gov. Andrew Cuomo since 2015. At the press conference, she said her management style is to “listen first, then take decisive action.”</p>
<p>She said that she would spend the two-week period to build out her senior staff and continue to develop her vision. Hochul said that she would name a new Lieutenant Governor prior to taking office. If she does not, New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins would serve as Acting Lieutenant Governor, while continuing to serve in her post as the leader of the State Senate.</p>
<p>“The Delta variant is still raging, and it’s going to take all of us to defeat it. Our children are heading back to school soon. There’s a lot of anxiety from the moms and dads I speak to, and the teachers as well,” she said. “It’s going to take all of us working together to keep our children safe, our teachers safe, and anyone who works in a school safe.”</p>
<p>While not detailing any possible actions she might take in response to the rising number of infections due to the Delta variant, Lt. Gov. Houchul would only say that she has been engaged with health care officials and is monitoring CDC guidelines. She did say that all options are on the table.</p>
<p>“More people being vaccinated is our key out of this,” Hochul told reporters.</p>
<p>Besides children going back to school, she did note that the business community is also nervous about COVID’s future impact on their operations.</p>
<p>“Small businesses are just starting to bounce back into an uncertain world. We need to reassure them that they’ll be okay,” she said. “And our workers are once again debating whether they should even go back to their jobs, or go back to their offices, go back to their factories. Is it safe enough? But I know New Yorkers. They are hardwired to persevere and to prevail.”</p>
<p>In an attempt to put some distance between her and the Cuomo administration, she noted that she and the governor were not close and that any individual accused of doing anything unethical in the New York State Attorney General’s report would not serve in her administration. “There will be turnover,” she added.</p>
<p>She also stressed that her administration would not have the same “toxic work environment” as was described by witnesses in the State Attorney General’s report. Hochul said that upon the completion of her term of office, “whenever it ends, no one will ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment.”</p>
<p>Hochul did not specifically address who she might choose to serve as Lieutenant Governor, but there is speculation that she may select someone from downstate to balance her ticket.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—Harbor Group International, LLC, a privately owned international real estate investment and management firm headquartered in Norfolk, VA, has entered into an agreement to acquire 51 W. 52nd St. in Midtown Manhattan for $760 million. Known as the “CBS Building” or “Black Rock,” this purchase marks the first sale since it opened in 1964.</p>
<p>The seller—ViacomCBS—will lease back its space on a short-term basis. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year. Earlier this year, Harbor Group acquired a multifamily property in Rockland and two office buildings in Yonkers.</p>
<p>“The agreement to acquire the CBS Building is further proof of HGI&#8217;s ability to identify and successfully transact for unique investment opportunities in an increasingly competitive market,” said Richard Litton, president, HGI. “With its prime location, Class A features, and strong roster of tenants, HGI is positioned to acquire one of New York City&#8217;s few iconic assets. We look forward to activating our strategic business plan for this asset at a transformational time for New York City&#8217;s office market.”</p>
<p>HGI plans to implement a significant capital program to reposition the property in support of a long-term leasing plan. Updates will include significant upgrades to the lobby and other tenant amenities.</p>
<p>“This agreement follows the previously announced strategic review of non-core assets that we completed shortly after our merger,” said Naveen Chopra, EVP and chief financial officer, ViacomCBS. “The use of proceeds from this transaction will remain consistent with our previously discussed capital allocation strategy, allowing us further financial flexibility to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including streaming.”</p>
<p>Located between 52nd and 53rd streets in the Avenue of the Americas corridor, the property is within walking distance of multiple train stations and is adjacent to Rockefeller Center, which houses many retail amenities and dining options.</p>
<p>Built to serve as CBS&#8217; New York headquarters, the tower features views of Central Park, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Midtown skyline. The historic property is the only skyscraper designed by renowned architect Eero Saarinen, whose work includes Lincoln Center Theater and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The acquisition will add to HGI&#8217;s Manhattan office portfolio. The firm owns 24 West 40th St. in Midtown on Bryant Park and also owns 55 Broadway in the Financial District.</p>
<p>Darcy Stacom and Bill Shanahan of CBRE are acting as exclusive agents for ViacomCBS in the transaction.</p>
<p>In July of this year, Harbor Group International, LLC, acquired <strong><a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/news/the-henry-apartments-in-pomona-trades-for-54-million/">The Henr</a>y</strong>, a 169-home luxury apartment community in Pomona, for $54 million. In April, Harbor Group reported that affiliates of the firm, in a joint venture with Benedict Realty Group acquired a <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/news/robert-martin-sells-two-yonkers-office-buildings-for-37-million/"><strong>single-tenant office property in Yonkers</strong> </a> for $37 million from an entity of Robert Martin Co.</p>
<p>The property includes two office buildings totaling 130,607 square feet and is located at 3 Executive Boulevard and 3 Odell Plaza. Both assets are leased on a long-term basis to Montefiore Medical Center (“Montefiore”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Montefiore Health System, one of the largest health care systems in the greater New York City area.</p>
<p>Harbor Group International and its affiliates control an investment portfolio of $14.5 billion including 4.4 million square feet of commercial space throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and 53,000 apartment units in the United States. In addition to its corporate headquarters in Norfolk, VA. HGI maintains offices in New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Tel Aviv.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>During the COVID-pandemic, Brown Harris Stevens Chief Executive Officer Bess Freedman has participated in several webinars hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and OneKey MLS and offered some frank assessments of market conditions, as well as her views on lockdowns and tax policies and their impacts on the market.</p>
<p>In preparing for this year’s<em> Focus on Manhattan Supplement</em>, HGAR felt there was no one better to update the readership of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> on where the New York City real estate market is heading in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>Freedman is Brown Harris Stevens first CEO and oversees the firm’s 55 offices and more than 2,300 agents across New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Florida. Under her leadership, Brown Harris Stevens has grown into one of the largest and most successful privately held real estate companies in the United States with annual sales of more than $9 billion.</p>
<p>She originally joined Brown Harris Stevens in 2013 to oversee business development. Her insights are frequently sought out by media including <em>CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox News, The New York Times,</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p>She is the former Co-President of Brown Harris Stevens and was a Senior Managing Director of the Corcoran Group&#8217;s East Side headquarters. A former agent herself, Freedman achieved repeated membership in Corcoran’s Multi-Million-Dollar Club.</p>
<p>Before entering real estate, she practiced law as an Assistant State&#8217;s Attorney in Montgomery County, MD, and also worked at Legal Aid as an attorney. Freedman is a member of the Florida, Washington, D.C. and Maryland Bar, and worked in New York pro hac vice. She speaks Spanish and has lived in various cities including Washington, D.C., Miami, and Seville, Spain. Originally from upstate New York, she earned an undergraduate degree from Ithaca College and a law degree from The University of the District of Columbia, David A. Clarke School of Law, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-37779" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bess_freedman_profile_2021.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" />The mother of two is an advocate for social change through her work with several organizations and earlier this year was the recipient of REBNY&#8217;s Kenneth R. Gerrety Humanitarian Award for outstanding service to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Back in January on a virtual panel discussion hosted by the HGAR and OneKey MLS, you said that the vaccine’s impact on the market will be critical in New York City’s recovery. While you noted that the path would be difficult, you said, “New York City is going to do very well. It’s still a buyer’s market—an opportunity market—rates are low. But theaters are going to reopen, restaurants are going to reopen … I’m doubling down on my prediction for New York City in 2021.” How does that prediction hold up to current market conditions?</p>
<p><strong>Freedman:</strong> I’ve given my predictions in interviews and now people are saying, “You were right.” I did believe strongly that the vaccine would be helpful obviously, once people got vaccinated and things started to open. And, I have to say I thought it would be a really good New York comeback, but it has been great. It’s even better than I expected it to be— the (sales) numbers, the response, things are opening and that’s great, but I will say that with a caveat because I still remain concerned because we are not out of the woods yet regarding the pandemic. Getting vaccinated should not be about politics. We should listen to doctors and science and take care of each other. And I don’t know how the hell we got to a place where this is like a political game where life-saving vaccines become political. I still don’t understand that. However, New York State is doing fairly well with vaccinations. We just issued a new guideline for Brown Harris Stevens for any agent, any employee or any visitor, if you want to come into offices, you have to be vaccinated. We have also brought the mask guideline back. We are being extra careful because I just want to be as vigilant as I can.</p>
<p>In terms of the mask guideline, if you are in any one of the Brown Harris Stevens offices, we ask that when you are walking around that you wear your mask. If you are sitting at your desk and there is nobody around, obviously we are okay with you pulling your mask down. But, when you are walking around and there are other people (nearby) we ask that you be respectful and keep your mask on, regardless of vaccination status. And we are asking that by Sept. 15 that everyone get vaccinated unless they have extenuating circumstances like they have some medical condition that prohibits them (from being vaccinated). In that case we obviously understand, you talk to HR, and we get it. But, if you don’t have that situation, then we insist you get vaccinated if you want to come into our offices.</p>
<p>Freedman later said that once the company reverts back to all full-time status at the office, the company will want all its staff to be vaccinated. “So, if there is an employee who for whatever reason just refuses to get vaccinated (without a valid medical reason) they will not have a future at Brown Harris Stevens because I can’t put (our workers) at risk. I have an elderly population, I have young Moms with kids here and I have to put health and safety above everything else. So, they will not have a future here if they are not going to get vaccinated,” Freedman said.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Do the rising number of cases due to the Delta COVID-19 variant concern you and could the market endure another shutdown?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37776 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4152-.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />Freedman:</strong> The Delta variant picking up very much concerns me and I am worried about us going back into a restrictive economy and people getting very sick. That concerns me greatly and it would hurt us. We are still in a recovering economy. You know what’s going on with the eviction moratorium. There has been rental federal aid that was supposed to get to all these people that can’t pay their rent and out of $45 billion, $3 billion has gotten to these people. People are struggling. Landlords need to pay bills. If we go back into lockdown, we are going to be in trouble and it will not be good for anybody, health-wise, economically, everything. So, that is why I am being so aggressive with the vaccinations and safety, because I don’t want us to slip back to where we were, where we were locked down and could not show real estate for months. I have good friends that are in the restaurant industry and they closed their restaurants. New York is still in recovery, so if we went back into lockdown could we handle it? Of course, but it would not be good.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With a new administration to be determined on Election Day, what are the key issues facing the city that you believe will be critical to solve in order to foster a true recovery?</p>
<p><strong>Freedman:</strong> I have been a big supporter of Eric (Adams, the Democratic nominee for Mayor). I liked a lot of the candidates, but I really got behind Eric and interviewed him and I think he really has the right idea for New York City because he is such an inclusive leader. He will work with the legislators, he will work with the businesses, he will work with unions, communities and teachers. That is what we need. We had a divisive environment in New York and we were sending the wrong message. We were demonizing the rich. The legislature was trying to tax them egregiously and we got a lot of people to move out of New York and that hurt us. So, I think the new leadership will bring people back to New York City, will work together to create an environment where everyone can prosper. You want businesses to prosper. You want wealthy people to live here. You want to build affordable housing. You have to do all of those things and I think for New York City Eric is going to be the right kind of leader for us.</p>
<p>Crime is definitely an issue and the reason why Eric won (the Democratic primary) is because he put safety as his number one talking point because no matter who you are or where you live in New York City, what people care about the most is safety. If you cannot walk the streets and feel comfortable, people are not going to buy here, invest here, live here and raise children here. The crime situation has already improved because there are more police on the MTA (trains and stations) and they are being more vigilant, but we still have a way to go. Historically, we are a very safe city if you look at 1990 or even 2000, the number of robberies and murders have gone down tremendously. Did crime pick up during the pandemic? Yes, but if you look at it in context we are still historically very low. We are doing well, we just need to keep moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Do you think the press reports of a mass exodus out of Manhattan were overblown and are you seeing any of those transplanted New Yorkers coming back to the city?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37780 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bess_Freedman-Headshot-e1591803446222.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="284" />Freedman:</strong> Yeah, I do think some of that coverage was overblown. What stories sell are bad news, something that is divisive. I think there was a lot of spin with that. Did we have people move out of New York City? We did. Part of that is factual. During the pandemic we were an epicenter for COVID and people left. And because of the tax policy, a lot of people left before the pandemic even hit because they did not want to pay these egregious taxes. So, we did have people leaving New York City, that is indeed true. But, was it a mass exodus? No, I think that is not a proper account. People did leave, but people have come back. We are seeing people come back in record numbers. The rental market is incredibly busy. People are coming back for schools and jobs. First-time homebuyers are here. The market is very good and we are seeing signs of people coming back from Connecticut, from Florida and from the Hamptons and putting their flag back up in New York City.</p>
<p>So, it wasn’t as crazy as it was described, but there was some truth to it. There were people leaving and now there are people who are coming back and we want that to continue moving in that direction. Hopefully with a safe city, a prosperous city, a city that has responsible tax policies, we will keep moving in that direction. We need all of those things to happen to keep the momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In 2020, Halstead merged with Brown Harris Stevens. How has that merger worked out? Also, recently you hired Chris Halstead, as executive sales director of brokerage operations for Fairfield County. In that announcement, your firm hinted on possible growth of those operations. Is your firm planning to grow in both Fairfield and Westchester and if so, how?</p>
<p><strong>Freedman:</strong> The merger has gone incredibly well, even though we did it during the pandemic, but it has been a lot of moving pieces. We have an incredibly talented group of agents and leadership. So that has been going well. But, there have been bumps, of course, it’s never perfect. Chris Halstead, who is helping us in Connecticut, is a manager that is working with all the other managers. We think he is going to be a great leader for the company. And, we are always open to more growth in places that make sense for the company. We want to grow in quality, we are not just looking to grow. Growth is not the goal. We are interested in the quality versus quantity. When it makes sense, we will definitely expand. We were talking about an expansion idea this morning, so that is always open for us.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Despite the recent uptick in Delta variant COVID cases in the New York metro area, New York City is essentially open for business. Most Broadway theaters are reopening in September, restaurants and bars are now allowing vaccinated patrons to dine indoors and the residential real estate market is back in full swing.</p>
<p>New developments are soaring—from Hudson Yards to Penn Station to Roosevelt Island—and both the sales and rental markets in Manhattan are experiencing an influx of young professionals, as well as empty nesters, who are ready to call the Big Apple their home.</p>
<div id="attachment_37805" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37805" class="wp-image-37805" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Tormey_PresidentofTitleVest.png" alt="" width="325" height="323" /><p id="caption-attachment-37805" class="wp-caption-text">Brian Tormey, President, TitleVest</p></div>
<p>Over the past year, Brian Tormey of TitleVest in Midtown Manhattan has had his hands on the pulse of the residential real estate market, hosting a series of “Be Your Best” webinars on “Getting the Deal Done”, sponsored by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and OneKey MLS, throughout the length of the pandemic. Awarded the “Best Title Agency” by the <em>New York Law Journal</em> reader rankings since 2013, TitleVest and Tormey have been at the forefront of a topsy-turvey real estate market since March of 2020.</p>
<p>“I’ve been impressed with the resilience I’ve seen from real estate professionals throughout the New York area,” said Tormey. “The pandemic has proven again one of the strengths of our region—we know how to take care of one another.”</p>
<p>On September 9, Tormey will host another one of his popular webinars, this time with the topic of “The New Manhattan.” Tormey and a panel of real estate experts will discuss how the once seemingly abandoned “city that never sleeps” is making its official comeback from a harrowing year with streets teeming with moving vans barreling toward the suburbs.</p>
<p>Now, new civic and private developments seem to be fueling a newfound interest in New York City, and Manhattan, especially. “To quote a good friend and past panelist, Bruce Cohen, ‘for every sale, there is a purchase.’ Now we’re starting to see time on market shorten and prices rising—both indicators of a strengthening market,” said Tormey.</p>
<p>As a result of increased seller concessions, low interest rates and available inventory during the height of the pandemic, Tormey and his team began to see an interest from buyers who may not have ordinarily been able to afford Manhattan. “People from all walks of life have taken advantage of that to shift from renting to owning, upsizing, downsizing or, for the first time, snagging their own slice of the Manhattan pie,” he noted. “I believe that we will see a vibrant Manhattan again, and soon, but it may look and feel a bit different than before, with adjusted work schedules, new commuting patterns and a renewed appreciation of alfresco living.”</p>
<p>Brian Phillips of Douglas Elliman Real Estate in the Bronx agrees that New York City real estate is back. “I’m definitely seeing people moving back in and I’ve noticed a lot of younger people—especially those without children,” he said. “While the post-pandemic prices are lower, I think they’re going to start slowly creeping back up.”</p>
<p>Phillips, who lists and sells throughout the five boroughs, noted that studios and one-bedrooms are being snatched up very quickly. “I’m also finding that there’s a lot less loyalty to specific neighborhoods—people are looking in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens or wherever they can find good deals,” he added.</p>
<p>Some of his clients are traveling from as far away as Florida, while others tend to be from Westchester, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. “People still want to be in New York City—offices are reopening, Broadway is coming back, and restaurants and bars are opening again. There’s definitely a new influx into the city.”</p>
<p>Currently, in upper Manhattan, one-bedroom co-ops are starting at about $300,000 for a walk-up building, where an elevator or doorman building starts at about $400,000. Two bedrooms are much higher, averaging $500,000. “The further north you go, the less expensive it gets, and the more space you have,” added Phillips.</p>
<div id="attachment_37802" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37802" class="wp-image-37802" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/189-Edgecombe-Ave-facade.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-37802" class="wp-caption-text">A 3,436-square-foot, five bedroom, five-and-a-half bath two-family townhouse in Hamilton Heights, Manhattan, offered for sale by the Brian Phillips Team of Douglas Elliman for $2,450,000.</p></div>
<p>A lot of his clients are also requesting terrace space, as well as a washer and dryer located in the unit. “After COVID, I think everyone is more concerned about having their own personal laundry appliances rather than using a public laundry room in the building,” he said.</p>
<p>As for rentals, Phillips sees landlord concessions starting to fade away. “During the pandemic, a lot of landlords had been offering one month free on a one-year lease and two months free on two-year leases,” he explained. “Also, we’re starting to see the real estate fees being paid by the tenant again, as opposed to the landlord paying them.”</p>
<p>Because of Phillips’ diversified listings, he didn’t experience a downturn during the pandemic. He found properties under $500,000 were moving in all five boroughs. “Since last year, transactions are faster now as well,” he noted. “There are electronic signatures and other forms of technology that make the deals go much quicker and smoother.”</p>
<p>Magdalena Ferenc of Corcoran on Manhattan’s West Side has seen a huge jump in sales and rentals this summer. Handling rentals in 10 buildings in Morningside Heights, she credits returning Columbia University students with helping her business soar. “July has been the craziest month of my real estate career,” she revealed. “I rented over 50 apartments and it felt like I was working day and night due to the time differences in other countries.”</p>
<p>Many of her rental clients are returning college students from India and China, who often share larger apartments to keep the costs affordable. Ferenc expects to rent at least 200 apartments by the end of the year. “I’m basically playing catch up from 2020, when things were a lot slower,” she added.</p>
<p>Like Phillips, Ferenc has also experienced the trend of landlords now cutting back on incentives. In the Morningside Heights area, two-bedroom rentals can typically start at $2,200, while three bedrooms can fetch $2,700 or more and four-bedrooms, $3,000 and up.</p>
<p>On the sales side, she’s also witnessing a sort of Renaissance in Inwood and the Bronx with Origin North, a collection of nine restored affordable co-op buildings. All of the renovated units have new kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, electrical work, and the buildings also offer new lobbies and outdoor landscaping.</p>
<p>“People are starting to discover upper Manhattan or Bronx neighborhoods like Bedford Park, Norwood and University Heights,” she said. “They’re getting priced out of other areas and are beginning to realize the value of home ownership in good areas with generous space and easy commutes to Midtown Manhattan. One-bedroom units at some Origin North locations start at just $265,000.</p>
<p>Ferenc said the response has been great and she has completed almost 20 deals already. “When I’d hold open houses in these areas before, it was only curious neighbors who often showed up,” she said. “Now, it’s very encouraging to see a lot of people who are interested.”</p>
<div id="attachment_37801" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37801" class="wp-image-37801" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Valentine-4H.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="251" /><p id="caption-attachment-37801" class="wp-caption-text">A one-bedroom, one-bath co-op in Bedford Park, Bronx, listed for sale by Corcoran for $265,000.</p></div>
<p>Yann Rousseau, of BARNES New York in Midtown Manhattan, found that higher end rentals were hit the hardest during COVID times. “Business did start to pick up at the beginning of 2021 and right now, we’re starting to see rental prices that we haven’t seen in a couple of years,” he said.</p>
<p>For Rousseau’s team, the Financial District and Midtown were the most affected for sales and rentals, while Soho, Greenwich Village and parts of Brooklyn remained strong. In 2020, some landlords were offering up to four months free, but now, he said, there are hardly any concessions.</p>
<p>In Midtown, and Manhattan’s upper east and west sides, studio rentals can range from $2,000 to $4,000 per month, while one-bedrooms can demand monthly rentals of $3,000 to $5,000, depending on the neighborhoods and age of the buildings. The average starting sales price of a studio in these areas is $500,000.</p>
<p>“I think the market for rentals will always be there because New York City can be transient,” explained Rousseau. “People may come here for a while to work, then move to the suburbs when they’re ready to start a family.”</p>
<p>Many of his co-op and condo sales are to foreign investors who are looking for a home base when they travel to the U.S. Others are purchasing properties to rent out. Rousseau is also seeing an influx of young professionals as well as some empty nesters who want a secondary home in Manhattan. “New York will always be New York, so to say that the real estate market is finally coming back is a little overstated,” he said.</p>
<p>BARNES New York is also opening its first Westchester office in Larchmont to deal with its European clients seeking a second residence in the suburbs. “The French American School in Mamaroneck is a big attraction, along with proximity to New York City, added Rousseau.   BARNES International Real Estate operates a third U.S. location in Miami and offers more than 100 locations in 20 countries worldwide, with more than 1,000 agents.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—In what was the culmination of a tumultuous two weeks in Albany, Gov. Andrew Cuomo officially resigned at midnight this morning and a short time later, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul became the first woman governor in the history of New York State. The newly installed governor wasted no time in outlining her highest priorities: combating the COVID-19 Delta variant, getting approximately $2 billion in direct federal COVID aid to New Yorkers more quickly and “beginning to change the culture in Albany.”</p>
<p>In terms of actions in the fight against COVID, she said the state must make sure school are safe.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul said, “We need to require vaccinations for all school personnel with an option to test out weekly, at least for now.” She said that she is working with all levels of government to set this policy and is also undertaking a new “Back to School” testing program to make coronavirus testing widely available and convenient for students and school staff.</p>
<p>She also said that she is directing the New York State Department of Health to institute “universal masking for anyone entering our schools.” Gov. Hochul also promised to announce later this week a series of school-related policies that she noted would be “concise and consistent, giving the school districts what they have been asking for.”</p>
<p>The governor also vowed to step up vaccinations in the state and also said the state would prepare to administer booster shots. She added the state would do whatever is necessary to deliver booster shots, even possibly reopening mass vaccination sites.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul then said that she is not satisfied with the pace of the state’s delivery of federal COVID assistance funds to renters and landlords. “I want the money out now. I want it out with no more excuses and delays,” the governor said. She stressed that renters who applied and were approved for assistance cannot be evicted for a year and said that after consulting with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart Cousins, the state will be launching a targeted campaign to reach more New Yorkers who qualify for COVID rent relief. She also said that her administration will be hiring more staff to process rental assistance applications.</p>
<p>In promising a fresh and more collaborative approach, Gov. Hochul also said that a “dramatic change in culture with accountability and no tolerance for individuals who cross the line” was necessary.</p>
<p>She said that she is directing an overhaul of state policies on sexual harassment and ethics, starting with the requirement that all training be conducted live.</p>
<p>Hochul was sworn into office shortly after midnight this morning in the Red Room at the state Capitol by New York Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Gov. Hochul held a ceremonial swearing in with State Senate Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Heastie in attendance and then met with both legislative leaders.</p>
<p>After the ceremonial swearing in, the 57th governor of New York said, “So this is an emotional moment for me, but it is one that I prepared for and I&#8217;m so looking forward to continuing the work we have to do. To that end, I spoke with President Biden last night to talk about a number of issues. He pledged his full support to my administration and anything we need. Particularly I thanked him for the support we&#8217;ve received from FEMA and others in terms of cleaning up after Henri and how we were prepared and I want to continue assessing the situation.”</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo announced on Aug. 10 that he would resign from office in two weeks after the New York State Attorney General’s report on sexual harassment allegations against the governor was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Hochul, who holds a bachelor’s degree from Syracuse University and a JD from Catholic University, served in the U.S. Congress from 2011 to 2013 representing the 26th Congressional District. She has served as Lieutenant Governor under current Gov. Andrew Cuomo since 2015.</p>
<p>Assembly Speaker Heastie in a prepared statement, said of Gov. Hochul taking office, “My colleagues and I know that our state is facing many significant challenges, and we are prepared to partner with Governor Hochul in addressing them. We look forward to working with her to ensure our children can safely return to school, New Yorkers are able to stay in their homes, small businesses can thrive again, our work to end to the scourge of gun violence continues and to fight the resurgence of COVID-19 to finally put this pandemic behind us. We stand ready to work with Governor Hochul to continue moving New York forward.”</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James noted, “Today is a historic day for New Yorkers with the swearing in of our first female governor, Kathy Hochul. I congratulate Governor Hochul on this incredible accomplishment and wish her well in her new role building on the progress of our great state. I look forward to continuing to work with her and the entire incoming administration.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency this morning granted incentives totaling nearly $15 million for two major development projects valued at a total of $755 million.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency this morning in a session that lasted less than 12 minutes, voted to grant incentives totaling $14.7 million to two major projects in Greenburgh and White Plains valued at a combined total of $755 million.</p>
<p>The IDA Board unanimously (5-0) approved granting $7.7 million in sales tax incentives for the $480-million expansion project by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in the Town of Greenburgh. In another unanimous vote, the IDA Board approved a final resolution granting the developers of the Gateway II mixed-use project in White Plains $5.36 million in sales tax exemptions and $1.65 million in mortgage recording tax exemptions in connection with their $275-million project to be developed at 25 Lexington Ave. in Downtown White Plains.</p>
<p>The only discussion during the IDA session centered around the Gateway II project and the contention by the developer— GS White Plains Owner, LLC, which is led by Greystar Real Estate Partners and the Alaska Permanent Fund, and its general contractor that it could not fully abide by the IDA’s recent local workforce hiring policy.</p>
<p>IDA Chairperson Joan McDonald said that after the IDA approved the preliminary inducement of the project at its June 24th session, the county and the IDA worked with the developer to hire more local labor. The county held a Construction Career Fair on Aug. 23 at the New York Power Authority building in Downtown White Plains where approximately 200 potential job applicants attended the three-hour event. General contractor LRC Construction and a number of sub-contractors were on hand looking to fill positions for two major projects: Gateway II, which will involve the development of 500 housing units and The Mitchell—a mixed use luxury development on the corner of Mamaroneck Avenue and East Post Road that is currently under construction. Both developments are located in Downtown White Plains. Available job positions included: Laborers, carpenters, plumbers, drivers, electricians, sheet rockers, building maintenance, security, masonry, and more, the county stated in its announcement.</p>
<p>McDonald said this morning at the IDA session that in June she committed that the county and the IDA would work with the developer, the general contractor and others “to help promote the project and encourage as much local labor as we could to increase the numbers that were in the resolution.”</p>
<p>She added that based on the interest at the Construction Career Fair, which was attended by Westchester County Executive George Latimer, the event “shows how the IDA and the county can work with our developer community, with the building trades, with our local governments to get as many people in Westchester County and the immediately surrounding communities employed in good paying jobs.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that labor representative on the IDA Board, Richard McSpedon voted against the Gateway II incentives back in June due in part to the workforce modifications, but voted in favor of the incentives at this morning’s session.</p>
<div id="attachment_37902" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37902" class="wp-image-37902" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Regeneron-Project-D-rendering-1024x474-1024x474.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="185" /><p id="caption-attachment-37902" class="wp-caption-text">A map of the proposed Parcel D building property in Greenburgh supplied to the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p></div>
<p>The proposed Gateway II project seeks to redevelop existing surface parking at 25 North Lexington Ave. into a 500-unit, 25-story residential apartment building. The project includes 19,000 square feet of ground floor retail and 755 parking spaces (626 serving the project and 129 spaces dedicated to the adjacent Gateway One office building, which is owned by the Alaska Permanent Fund.</p>
<p>The mix of apartment units includes 167 studio units, 208 one-bedroom units, 117 two-bedroom units, and eight three-bedroom units. A total of 15 on-site units will be classified as affordable in compliance with the city’s Affordable Rental Housing Program Regulations in addition to a $3.8-million contribution to the City of White Plains’ affordable housing contribution fund.</p>
<p>The Regeneron project is an expansion of its “Parcel D” project originally proposed in 2015 as a building not to exceed 192,000 square feet that secured Westchester IDA approval, but never moved forward.</p>
<p>The amended incentives application with the IDA approved this morning calls for the construction of a new two-story, 207,940-square-foot building, along with a parking structure and other infrastructure that will increase the development cost of the original project (including equipment) by approximately $331 million to $480 million.</p>
<p>Regeneron estimates that construction costs will total $310 million, design costs $21.7 million and FF&amp;E (furniture, fixtures and equipment) $148.9 million. The cost of the original project in 2015 was estimated at $150 million.</p>
<p>The new building will primarily house Regeneron’s pre-clinical manufacturing and process development operations.</p>
<p>At the Westchester County IDA’s July 22 meeting, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals representatives told the agency that it expects to come before the IDA “very shortly” with another major new development project in the Town of Greenburgh.</p>
<p>Although Regeneron representatives did not provide any details on the new project at that session or again this morning, its representations at the July session pointed to a parcel of land where the firm has previously secured approvals from the Town of Greenburgh for the construction of a group of buildings that could total approximately 1 million square feet at 555 Saw Mill River Road.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law on Sept. 2  a new moratorium on COVID-related residential and commercial evictions for New York State which will be in effect until Jan. 15, 2022. The moratorium extension is now in the courts as a major landlord association has filed suit against the new law.</p>
<p>Under the new law, all protections of the Tenant Safe Harbor Act for residential tenants who are suffering financial hardship as a result of the pandemic will remain in place, along with new protections on commercial evictions. The State Legislature in extraordinary session approved the eviction moratorium extension last night. The prior eviction moratorium lapsed on Aug. 31.</p>
<p>The legislation does provide some relief to beleaguered landlords. Landlords who believe that their tenant has not suffered a financial hardship will now be permitted to request a hearing in court. Landlords can also evict tenants that are creating safety or health hazards for other tenants, intentionally damaging property, and where a tenant did not submit a hardship declaration.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has created unimaginable anxiety for families and business owners who have lost income and are struggling to pay the rent every month,” Gov. Hochul said. “To help remedy the Supreme Court&#8217;s heartless decisions striking down the New York and the Biden administration&#8217;s moratoriums on evictions, we are enacting a new moratorium on residential and commercial evictions and extending the protections of New York&#8217;s Safe Harbor Act to January 15. These steps will alleviate the crisis facing vulnerable New Yorkers who are suffering through no fault of their own.”</p>
<p>As expected, the Rent Stabilization Association filed suit on Sept. 9  against the State of New York over its extension of the eviction moratorium until Jan. 15, 2022.</p>
<p>The Rent Stabilization Association filed a motion with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the recently extended eviction moratorium by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, according to a report in the<em> New York Post</em>. The group said the moratorium made only “superficial changes” to the previous law that was subject to a critical U.S. Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p>Gov. Hochul urged New Yorkers who are struggling to pay their rent to apply for assistance through the state&#8217;s Emergency Rental Assistance Program, or ERAP. Applicants to this program are automatically protected from eviction while their application is pending and will receive a year of eviction protections if they qualify for assistance.</p>
<p>As of August 31, more than $1.2 billion in funding has either been obligated or distributed through ERAP, including more than $300 million in direct payments to more than 23,000 landlords.</p>
<p>Currently, 176,000 ERAP applications have been filed, and more than $230 million in payments have been made to more than 15,000 households. New York is on track to obligate the federally required 65% of the first round of rental assistance by the end of September.</p>
<p>The localities of the City of Rochester, Monroe County, Onondaga County, the Town of Hempstead, the Town of Oyster Bay, the Town of Islip and the City of Yonkers opted to administer their own rental assistance programs. This bill would allow residents of these localities to apply to the state ERAP program if the locality has certified they have exhausted their federal emergency rental assistance funds. The locality would also be required to notify eligible applicants that were denied because of exhausted funding that they may be eligible to apply for ERAP, provide the applicant with information on how to apply and also post that information on their website. Additionally, the legislation would provide the tenant protections built into ERAP to applicants seeking assistance from a local program, as well as allowing homeowners to seek an eviction where the tenant intentionally causes significant damage to the property.</p>
<p>The law also creates a $25-million fund to provide legal services to tenants facing eviction proceedings and to help them maintain housing stability in areas of the state where access to free legal assistance for such services is not available.</p>
<p>The law establishes a new $250-million Supplemental Emergency Rental Assistance program to serve additional households and to better support landlords. Through this program, $125 million will be made available to provide assistance to households with income that exceeds 80% of Area Median Income (AMI), and up to 120% of AMI. Additionally, $125 million will be made available for assistance to landlords whose tenants refuse to participate or have vacated the residence with arrears.</p>
<p>Under New York&#8217;s enacted moratorium, tenants must submit a hardship declaration, or a document explaining the source of the hardship, to prevent an eviction proceeding from moving forward.</p>
<p>The legislation places a moratorium on residential foreclosure proceedings so that homeowners and small landlords who own 10 or fewer residential dwellings can file hardship declarations with their mortgage lender, other foreclosing party, or a court that would prevent a foreclosure.</p>
<p>The legislation&#8217;s moratorium on commercial evictions and commercial foreclosure proceedings apply to small businesses with 100 or fewer employees that demonstrate a financial hardship. Tenants must submit a hardship declaration, or a document explaining the source of the hardship, to prevent evictions.</p>
<p>New York State Senator Brian Kavanagh said, &#8220;From the very beginning of the pandemic, we have been committed to ensuring that all New Yorkers—including renters and homeowners—are protected from losing their homes because of the hardships wrought by COVID-19. We&#8217;ve also worked hard to ensure that the financial burden on tenants and landlords is lifted, through generously funded, effective relief programs, and to protect small businesses.”</p>
<p>Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz added, &#8220;This legislation is as much health policy as it is economic policy, and we must do everything we possibly can to keep New Yorkers safe amidst a surge in the Delta variant. This law will help thousands of families keep a roof over their heads and doors open for small businesses as the state works to improve and streamline the ERAP program and we all work together on a recovery from this deadly pandemic.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Realtors won a victory at the federal level when the Supreme Court struck down a CDC eviction moratorium by a 6-3 margin reasoning that the CDC exceeded its authority to issue the moratorium absent Congressional legislation. Forty-two billion dollars in rental assistance was passed by Congress in March. To date, nationally, only $11 billion has been spent. This appears to be due to the inability of states to distribute the funds as most had no process in place to do so.</p>
<p>In New York State, the eviction moratorium has been repeatedly extended and recently was further extended until Jan. 15, 2022 after Gov. Kathy Hochul called for a special session of the state legislature. Very little of the rental aid has reached the landlords. The site has been riddled with errors and has been virtually impossible to navigate and the tenant has to apply on behalf of the landlord which, generally speaking, tenants have been unmotivated to do.</p>
<p>The other federal legislative issue that Congress must act on is the federal debt ceiling (the amount of money the government can spend without Congressional action). The debt limit must be either raised or suspended every year or so. If Congress fails to act it would lead to a credit down grade, default on government obligations (e.g. Social Security payments) and roiling of financial markets.</p>
<p>The other two bills that may or may not pass are the social infrastructure bill, which would cost about $3.5 trillion and the bipartisan infrastructure deal which does not raise taxes. The bigger bill has not been paid for as yet. The bipartisan bill would use unspent coronavirus funds and require an additional $550 billion over what the government planned to spend on infrastructure over the next eight years.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates on these issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A Realtor must act in the best interests of his/her client (Code of Ethics, Article 1). A good agent will do everything in their power to get their client the best deal or consummate a transaction. However, sometimes, an agent will overreach in order to manipulate parties or negotiations. While good-intentioned, it may get the agent into hot water with the Professional Standards Committee, or worse, New York State authorities. Here are some things to be aware of or avoid.</p>
<p><strong>Showing Instructions</strong></p>
<p>OneKey Rule 404.5 requires that<em> “[a]ny instructions by an owner…restricting showings or access to a Property must be in writing and signed by the owner….”</em> Such instructions must be on file with the listing broker and they must be made available immediately upon request.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that the homeowner establishes the rules for showings, not the agent. What an agent might prefer for a showing is irrelevant. While an agent may like the idea of having only pre-qualified buyers see a property, they cannot require this, unless the request is coming from the homeowner and in writing…and that writing must be made available to any cooperating agent that requests it. If it’s not in the listing agreement, then it should be memorialized somewhere else. Same for requiring COVID-19 forms; without the homeowner’s consent, they cannot be required for a showing.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen an uptick in rental listing agents requiring all sorts of documentation in order for a tenant to see a rental. Things such as pre-screenings, full application completion, credit checks and W-2 forms are being required. While this may seem like a quick, efficient shortcut to finding a tenant, it raises some ethical issues. Assuming that an agent is sitting down with the homeowner and discussing these requirements, it may be in the agent’s best interests to explain that such initial barriers to a showing may reduce the number of showings, increase a property’s days on market, and reduce competition which may, ultimately, result is a lower rental price. Failing to explain this to a client could be a violation of the Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>Further, creating onerous requirements for just a showing may raise thoughts of fair housing violations. Someone may say, “Is my client the only one being required to jump through all these hoops or is this just a ploy to discriminate against my clients?” Lawsuits are easy to file and hard to defend and will consume time and resources even if defended successfully.</p>
<p>Failing to have a full discussion with a client about the pros and cons of these potentially burdensome requirements, as well as having them reduced to a signed writing by the client can get an agent in hot water. Not only could an agent be in violation of the OneKey rule, but they may be in violation of Code of Ethics Article 1 (not acting in the best interests of their client and not treating all parties honestly), Article 2 (making a misrepresentation about the property or the transaction), and Article 3 (failing to cooperate with other brokers), but there could be Department of State investigations, and New York State Attorney General’s office investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation of Offers/Counter-Offers</strong></p>
<p>The Code of Ethics, Article 1, Standard of Practice 1-6, states that “Realtors shall submit offers and counter-offers objectively and as quickly as possible.” Further, Standard of Practice 1-7 and 1-8 state that these offers must continue to be presented unless the client waived this obligation in writing. Nowhere does the rule state that the presentation of offers can be anything other than “as quickly as possible.” Further, OneKey Rule 405.3, a mandatory NAR rule, states that a listing broker, or someone in the listing broker’s office “must immediately advise” a seller/landlord that an offer has been made and they shall “make timely arrangements for the offer(s) to be presented.” Again, there is no provision that permits anything but “immediate” and “timely” presentation of all offers.</p>
<p>Problems arise when, whether for the sake of convenience or for strategy purposes, an agent decided the timing of when offers will be presented. Perhaps the offer is extremely low and the agent knows that the client will reject it. Maybe the agent may wish to hold off presenting offers until the property has been on the market for a week, or until after a weekend open house. Maybe the client is out of town and returning in a week. Perhaps an agent has a preferred offer that they presented and the agent puts all the other offers into a “holding pattern” until the client has had an opportunity to decide on that preferred offer. All these actions may be a violation of the rules (potentially Articles 1, 2, 3, and OneKey Rule 405). The fact remains that the rules require that all offers must be presented as quickly as possible/immediately/timely. Holding off on the presentation of offers, for any reason, can result in an agent violating these rules, not to mention that, as noted before, a party may assert that their offer was not presented as a way of discriminating against them.</p>
<p>Additionally, remember that simply because a party is making a counter-offer does not negate the timing of presentation. Initial offers and counter-offers are all treated the same and an agent cannot refuse to allow a buyer from presenting a counter-offer, even one that may seem unreasonable.</p>
<p>Be reminded that offers should be presented a.s.a.p. If the homeowner wishes to hold off on opening or analyzing them, that is their prerogative, not the agents. The agent does not decide. The agent needs to follow the rules and understand what’s their role in the process. They might suggest the timing of reviewing offers, but they cannot hold off on presenting offers or counter-offers up until the time of closing, unless this requirement is waived in writing by the client.</p>
<p>Speaking of offers and counter-offers, an agent should remember that all offers, including counter-offers, must be presented in the same fashion. To hand-deliver some, e-mail or verbally present others may influence a client’s opinion about an offer or create bias toward an offer. The rule is that they all must be presented objectively. Varying the way offers are presented, whether in the timing or the fashion in which they are presented, can run afoul of the rule.</p>
<p><strong>Lying or “Baiting”</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes agents take “artistic license” or otherwise get creative with what they say to other agents regarding offers. An agent might suggest that there is an offer or more than one offer that will imminently be coming in to create pressure on a buyer. Or an agent may disclose that a potential buyer’s offer should be at a certain price because there is another agent that is considering or made a similar offer. The problems arise when the facts are not true.</p>
<p>First, agents can’t just say that they have offers (assuming that there is an actual offer) without their client’s consent. Keep in mind that the Code of Ethics, Article 1, Standard of Practice 1-15, provides that the client decides if they wish to disclose the existence of any offers (that are not accepted offers). The agent needs permission from his/her client to disclose the existence of offers.</p>
<p>Second, an agent cannot lie or invent questionable offers in order to obtain other higher offers. That is a blatant violation of the Code of Ethics (Articles 1 and 2). Even if it benefits their client by creating pressure to induce a higher offer, it cannot be done because you are not treating the other parties honestly and you are making misrepresentations about the transaction. Something as innocuous as, “I have someone who’s looking to offer “X.” If you come in at that price plus a little more, I can guarantee you’ll get it” is very problematic. If no such offer exists, then the agent is improperly “baiting” the buyer’s agent. An agent cannot dangle a fictitious offer in order to induce another buyer to act, even if it benefits their client. Further, the agent cannot guarantee anything. The agent must go to the client to see if they’ll accept the offer; the agent can’t do it. Promising the offer will be accepted is overreaching.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Knowing what an agent can and cannot do is the difference between being a successful Realtor and being a Realtor that is standing before a tribunal. Don’t overreach and act like the client. Know your duties, know the rules, be timely and honest in all your dealings and, above all, stay in your lane!</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Sept. 1, 2021, our area was hit particularly hard from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Record-setting levels of rain fell in just a few hours causing unprecedented flash flooding leaving horrific death and destruction in its wake. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those who lost their lives and to their loved ones. The flooding caused by Ida took the lives of 29 people in New Jersey, 16 people in New York City and one person in Connecticut. Of those who died in New York City, 11 perished  in illegal basement apartments (see <a href="https://nyti.ms/3kcfq4y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nyti.ms/3kcfq4y</a>).</p>
<p>New York City has long had problems with illegal basement apartments which number in the tens of thousands. Unfortunately, it is at times like this when the real danger of these illegal apartments is brought to the forefront. Homeowners, real estate agents, real estate attorneys and other real estate professionals need to be aware of the dangers and the potential liability that exist in connection with illegal apartments.</p>
<p><strong>New York City Prohibitions and Requirements Relating to Basement Apartments</strong></p>
<p>New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development provides that “basements and cellars in residential properties of all sizes can NEVER be lawfully rented or occupied unless the conditions meet the minimum requirements for light, air, sanitation and egress, and have received approval by the Department of Buildings (DOB).” HPD recommends that before entering into any lease, tenants should visit New York City’s DOB website to review the certificate of occupancy for the home in which the apartment is located to determine whether the apartment is illegal (see <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3tIp9D1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.nyc.gov/3tIp9D1</a>). Purchasers should also review the DOB records (and the records of any town or city building department) before entering into a contract of sale for the purchase of a home so as to confirm whether or not a basement apartment is legal. The DOB also provides additional tips to help tenants determine whether the apartment was illegally converted to an apartment (see <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3nxZZ8N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.nyc.gov/3nxZZ8N</a>).</p>
<p>HPD also provides detailed information regarding whether a basement or cellar apartment (which are defined differently) may or may not be occupied or rented (see <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3AdXdcy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.nyc.gov/3AdXdcy</a>). The HPD explains that “cellars in one- and two-family homes can never be lawfully rented. Cellars in one- and two-family homes cannot be lawfully used for sleeping, eating, or primary [occupancy].” However, basements may be occupied or rented in limited instances. It is important to note that there are different requirements as to whether a basement apartment may be legally occupied (i.e., by a family member or members) and whether it can be lawfully rented.</p>
<p><strong>The Dangers of Illegal Apartments and the Potential Liability</strong></p>
<p>HPD warns that “occupants of illegal basement and cellar apartments face potential dangers such as carbon monoxide poisoning, inadequate light and ventilation, and inadequate egress in the event of a fire.” After the flooding caused by Ida, it is clear that the dangers of limited egress proved to be deadly where water levels rose so quickly trapping several individuals in these illegal apartments. According to the <em>Gothamist</em> (see <a href="https://bit.ly/39ae3gm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/39ae3gm</a>), the New York Police Department is “…investigating the six incidents in which basement apartment dwellers lost their lives during last Wednesday&#8217;s storm, opening up the potential for criminal charges against homeowners who may have created dangerous conditions for their tenants.”</p>
<p>The HPD and DOB will conduct inspections for illegal occupancy and rentals of basements and cellars and will issue violations. If an apartment is found to be illegal, a vacate notice will be issued, forcing the tenant to move and look for another apartment. If a vacate order is issued, the occupant can receive relocation services through HPD and HPD will place liens on the property owners for the costs incurred in connection with the relocation services (which could also include the cost of temporary housing) provided to these tenants. HPD further explains that “if the Vacate Order is issued by HPD, the agency will notify the owner and occupants and provide an enforcement date. HPD will re-inspect the premises on the enforcement date to verify the illegal basement or cellar apartment is vacant and properly sealed.”</p>
<p><strong>Will Insurance Policies Cover Potential Wrongful Death Claims and Other Losses?</strong></p>
<p>Another major issue that exists is whether a homeowner’s insurance policy or flood policy, if one exists, will cover the extensive property damage and claims made by those who lost family members in the illegal apartments. Many insurance policies will customarily attempt to exclude coverage, especially when it involves illegal acts, leaving the homeowner with extensive liability and legal exposure. Landlords and property owners could face lawsuits and, ultimately, large judgments, if it is found that the illegal apartments were unsafe and dangerous.</p>
<p>Depending on the types of coverages and exclusions contained in each policy, individuals (and businesses) may not be reimbursed entirely for all of the losses sustained. The<em> Wall Street Journal</em> reports that “rain that enters buildings through holes created by winds in doors, windows, walls and roofs is considered damage from windstorms, not flooding, and won’t be covered by flood insurance.” (See <a href="https://on.wsj.com/3tIV7ib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.wsj.com/3tIV7ib</a>). Damage caused by the wind may be covered but only after the homeowner covers the deductible. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> further points out that insurance will normally not “…cover structural improvements to the home—only the costs necessary to restore the home to the condition it was in before the flooding” and explains that “renters who live in basement units and have a flood insurance policy from the government are out of luck. The program doesn’t cover personal possessions below ground level, according to FEMA.” Additionally, for those homeowners with basements, insurance coverage normally “…only includes structural elements, cleanup costs and equipment that is typically stored in a basement such as oil tanks, furnaces, hot water heaters, washing and drying machines, and circuit breaker boxes.”</p>
<p><strong>The Potential Risk and Liability Faced by Real Estate Licensees</strong></p>
<p>Real estate agents must also be careful when listing apartments for rental or sale. Liability could extend to real estate licensees who knowingly rent illegal apartments to tenants. When advertising rentals, and even sales, real estate agents must be very careful. Under Section 175.25(b)(9) all “advertisements shall include an honest and accurate description of the property to be sold or leased.” According to guidance (“DOS Guidance”) issued (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3tOBC83" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3tOBC83</a>) by the New York State Department of State, Division of Licensing, licensees must make a reasonable effort to verify the legal status of the properties marketed and are required to disclose a property’s illegal status to potential purchasers or tenants. According to the DOS Guidance, “…where a broker has actual knowledge that a property lacks a permit or is otherwise illegal (i.e., illegal conversion), such information must be affirmatively disclosed. This requirement is found squarely within the department’s powers to discipline a licensee for: ‘dishonest or misleading advertising, or [where such licensee] has demonstrated untrustworthiness or incompetency.’ NY RPL § 441-c.” The DOS further stated that “it is a well-established rule that the department is ‘vested with broad discretion in imposing punishment on real estate licensees who have demonstrated untrustworthiness, and the exercise of that discretion will not be lightly disturbed.’” Ultimately, the DOS has broad powers to issue substantial fines and revoke real estate licenses.</p>
<p>Further, despite the fact that New York is a <em>caveat emptor</em> (i.e., “Buyer Beware”) state, under Real Property Law Section 443 (Disclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationships), the broker has a duty, whether representing the seller or when acting as a buyer&#8217;s agent to “…disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of property except as otherwise provided by law.” While the seller may be afforded the protections of the caveat emptor doctrine, a real estate licensee could be held liable for not disclosing the fact that an illegal apartment is being marketed for rent, or that a home with an illegal apartment is being listed for sale, as these are facts which clearly affect the value or desirability of the property. If a broker knows that there is no certificate of occupancy, that fact must be disclosed. Many times, real estate agents claim that a seller or landlord instructs them not to disclose this information. However, according to the DOS and New York’s Real Property Law, following the seller&#8217;s direction to not disclose such information would constitute an act of untrustworthiness which could lead to loss of a commission, imposition of fines, revocation of one’s license and other liability. When such a circumstance arises, the licensee may need to withdraw from representing the client.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate Closings: Ida’s Devastating Effects</strong></p>
<p>Similar to what transpired when Hurricane Sandy hit the New York area, many pending real estate transactions will be forced to be adjourned for significant periods or to be potentially terminated altogether. Lenders on many transactions have already sent out notices to purchasers that they will need to re-inspect the properties before they are able to proceed with the transaction. Some lenders have begun to circulate “Affidavits of No Damage” to the parties, requesting the parties affirm whether or not the property sustained any damage as a result of the storm. According to <em>The Real Deal</em>, the “…flash floods in New York and New Jersey in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida could delay or derail as many as 47,000 pending real estate transactions valued at more than $19.4 billion in those states alone….” <em>The Real Deal</em> reported that “New Jersey was hit harder than New York, with 30,462 transactions worth $10.7 billion in jeopardy. There were 17,019 transactions worth $8.7 billion at risk in New York. …” Homeowners should contact their insurance carriers immediately and file a claim. Real estate agents and attorneys should reach out to their clients and determine if any damage was sustained and provide them with any assistance and guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Assistance is Available</strong></p>
<p>Homeowners and tenants alike must take affirmative steps to inform their insurance carriers about the losses sustained and file claims immediately. Governor Hochul secured an Emergency Disaster Declaration from President Biden and has instructed insurance companies to file all claims expeditiously. The counties covered by the emergency declarations include Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester. All of those who were affected by the remnants of Hurricane Ida should visit the Disaster Flood Resource Center set up by New York State Department of Financial Services (see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/39cJTZO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/39cJTZO</a>). It provides important information regarding obtaining financial assistance from New York State as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) (see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3tPeGWo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3tPeGWo</a>). Between the coverages afforded by insurance companies and assistance provided by the state and federal governments, hopefully those affected by the storm will be made whole. Unfortunately, no assistance will be able to bring back the loved ones lost due to the storm, but one must learn from these events so as to try to avoid it as much as possible in the future.</p>
<p>Homeowners in disaster areas should reach out to their mortgage servicer if they are located in a federally declared disaster area. <em>Inman</em> <em>News</em> reported that “Mortgage servicers can provide forbearance for up to 90 days to homeowners they believe were affected, without contacting them. Homeowners in disaster areas may be able to reduce or suspend their mortgage payments for up to 12 months without incurring late fees or risking foreclosure.”<em> Inman</em> also pointed out that Fannie Mae was also providing a Disaster Payment Deferral Plan [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3tGL79e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3tGL79e</a>] which may help homeowners catch up on missed payments.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors is working with HGAR and other local associations to provide grants and financial assistance as well. In addition, NAR provides invaluable resources and guidance for Realtors (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3k8tk7L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3k8tk7L</a>) when natural disasters such as Hurricane Ida occur.</p>
<p><strong>We Must All Come Together</strong></p>
<p>It is important that all real estate professionals and the real estate community come together in times of need to help those affected by these natural disasters and horrific events. Assisting those in need and providing them with the guidance necessary may not bring back loved ones or physical possessions, but it will go a long way to helping those affected by these tragic events to heal and move forward a little quicker. It is also critically important for real estate agents to inform the clients of the dangers of renting illegal apartments. The exposure to liability is immense and must be stressed to all of those who rent and market real property for sale or lease.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>POUGHKEEPSIE—The cost of adding a third lane on a 47-mile stretch of Route 17 from Harriman to Monticello in each direction is now being estimated at anywhere from $525 million to as high as $1.04 billion, depending on the scope of the improvements to be undertaken.</p>
<p>The latest project cost estimates were revealed at the third public workshop of the New York State Department of Transportation’s Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group held virtually on Sept. 14. A final report that will include recommendations to move forward on the project is expected to be released at the end of next month.</p>
<p>NYSDOT officials and study consultants who authored the Route 17 Draft PEL Study have initially recommended moving forward with four alternatives: No Build, which is required for any future project-level National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review within the Route 17 corridor; General Use Third Lane Alternatives; Interchange (Improvement) Alternatives and Alternatives to Improve Connectivity to Mass Transit.</p>
<p>The PEL Study Group did not recommend moving forward on a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane, Light Rail and Bus Rapid Transit alternatives. The report included in-depth traffic analysis that identified current and projected traffic choke points as well as environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Mark Tiano, PE, NYSDOT Project Manager for the Route 17 PEL study, acknowledged that if the Route 17 project were to advance as a “mega project” that the cost could run as high as $1 billion. In the question and answer session of the hearing, Mr. Tiano said that the PEL Study group has looked at the entire corridor and considered any limit or reduction in the length of the project.</p>
<p>Consultant Rebecca Novak, civil department manager at WSP USA’s office in Valhalla, said, “If the entire thing (adding a third lane) was set as a major project to go out tomorrow based on our estimate, which of course it is not, then the total would be about $1 billion. But, we are just trying to identify the range of costs for the range of alternatives and it is going to be progressed in smaller pieces to meet the demand of future traffic and as the budget allows.”</p>
<p>She noted that the final PEL report that is expected to be released at the end of October will look to prioritize projects to be included in future NYSDOT capital plans.</p>
<p>The PEL study offered two alternatives for the General Use Third Lane, a less expensive Option 1 that would cost between $12 million to $16 million per mile and cost $310 million to $420 million for work on the roadway’s length in Orange County and $215 million to $290 million from the Sullivan County line to Monticello—putting the total project cost range between $525 million to $710 million.</p>
<p>The more-costly Third Lane Option 2 would cost between $16 million to $20 million per mile to complete and would cost $420 million to $720 million in Orange County and $290 million to $320 million in Sullivan County, putting the total cost range between $710 million to $1.04 billion.</p>
<p>The NYSDOT PEL Study also lays out a host of interchange improvements in both Orange and Sullivan counties that run the gamut in cost from approximately $1 million to as high as $43 million each. The cost ranges for all of the interchange improvements in Orange County are between $120 million to $150 million, while the projects outlined in Sullivan County came in between $40 million to $70 million.</p>
<p>The need for a third lane on Route 17 has been fueled by development all along the corridor. The report noted, “It is projected that traffic congestion on Route 17 will worsen over the near-term and long-term planning horizons as a consequence of projected population growth and development within the corridor.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-38117" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ROUTE-17-OC-INTERCHANGE-PLANS-CROPPED.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="380" />While growth rates have declined from their peak in recent years, it is estimated that the population of Orange County will reach 521,000 by the end of 2050, an increase of roughly 145,000 over current levels. “Congestion is also anticipated to worsen in the future as a consequence of new development in both Orange and Sullivan counties, including the Center for Discovery expansion, the Amy’s Kitchen factory and warehouse, the Yidel Weiss warehouse, the Presidential Container Group manufacturing expansion, the Medline warehouse relocation and expansion, the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets expansion, and several other potential retail, hotel, and warehouse projects in various stages of development,” the report stated.</p>
<p>A coalition of business and civic organizations called 17-Forward-86 has been advocating for NYSDOT to approve and secure funding for a third lane on Route 17 in both directions in Orange and Sullivan counties to accommodate the significant economic growth in the region.</p>
<p>The group has lobbied federal and state lawmakers to include funding for the Route 17 expansion in the massive infrastructure bill now being debated in Congress with the belief that the Route 17 third project would come in at approximately $500 million.</p>
<p>John T. Cooney, Jr., executive Director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc., said in reaction to the higher cost estimates for the Route 17 expansion, “As with all major regional infrastructure initiatives to improve our public facilities, total project cost is based on many factors and always subject to the construction market at hand. All price estimates to date for the Route 17 improvement project have come from federal and state research reports and not the 17-Forward-86 coalition.” CIC is a Founding Member of the 17-Forward-86 Coalition.</p>
<p>He continued, “The PEL study (planning and environment linkages) is updating cost estimates from NYSDOT’s 2013 corridor study, using revised traffic and economic data—including supply-chain shortages and material cost increases—and other measures to address the corridor’s needs. It’s also important to note that the updated costs indicate the third lane ‘could’ be built through Orange and Sullivan counties for a little over $500 million.”</p>
<p>Cooney said that while major cost increases are never easily palatable, the concept of adding a third lane is a project that has lingered since 1998. “We cannot ignore all the benefits this project will bring to the Hudson Valley. Beyond safety, enhanced mobility, less congestion and air-quality improvements—there is the powerful economic multiplier effect that shows the entire region benefiting from the project by as much as five times the project’s actual price tag,” he said.</p>
<p>The PEL process is being initiated by the NYSDOT in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration. The DOT last year began a scoping and preliminary review process as part of the $5 million PEL study, whose funding was secured through the 2018-2019 state budget.</p>
<p>The PEL study is a follow-up to a NYSDOT study released in May 2013 that examined the corridor between Monticello, Exit 103 (Rapp Road) and Harriman, Exit 131 (New York State Thruway) to help accommodate transportation demands brought about by economic growth in the region and to help accommodate future growth.</p>
<p>The final 2013 reported recommend: adding a general use third lane, in each direction, from Interstate 87 in Harriman to just west of Middletown, Orange County; improve key interchanges in Orange and Sullivan counties; provide new and expanded park and ride lots at strategic locations in Orange and Sullivan counties and recommend some provisions for future transit.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—In a major step to convert the state’s energy grid to green, New York State has selected two major green energy infrastructure projects that will cost $8.2 billion to develop and help bring wind, solar and hydropower from Upstate New York and Canada to New York City. The two projects involve a total of approximately 513 miles of transmission line that will both traverse the entire length of the Mid-Hudson Valley region. The two ventures, if they secure final approvals, will create approximately 10,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The construction building trades will also benefit from the two projects— Clean Path NY (CPNY) and Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE) since the state will be requiring the two awarded contracts to “include prevailing wage provisions for all laborers, workers, and mechanics performing construction activities with respect to the construction of the projects. In addition, the project developers will be required to negotiate Project Labor Agreements among their construction contractors and a building and construction trade labor organization representing craft workers for the construction of the new transmission lines as well as for the construction of the new renewable energy generation resources that the developers and its affiliates build for this project in New York State.”</p>
<p>The selections were announced on Sept. 20 at an event held in New York City attended by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and a host of other state and city dignitaries.</p>
<p>The two projects will help reduce New York City&#8217;s reliance on fossil fuels, lower carbon emissions and significantly improve air quality and public health in disadvantaged communities while accelerating progress to exceed New York&#8217;s goal for 70% of the state&#8217;s electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 on the path to a zero-emission grid as outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act).</p>
<p>“New York&#8217;s communities are repeatedly facing serious consequences as a result of the devastation caused by the global climate crisis, and the stakes have never been higher as we deal with the economic and environmental destruction these extreme weather events leave behind,” Gov. Hochul said. “These transformative projects are a win-win—delivering thousands of new good-paying jobs throughout the state and attracting billions of dollars in private investment. They also help us turn the page on New York City&#8217;s long-standing dependence on fossil fuels and will ensure millions of New Yorkers, especially those living in our most vulnerable communities, can have the promise of cleaner air and a healthier future.”</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a transformative moment for New York City&#8217;s fight against climate change,&#8221; said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. &#8220;Two new transmission lines connecting New York City to electricity from water, the wind, and solar will create thousands of good union jobs, improve the resilience and reliability of our power supply, and dramatically reduce our reliance on oil and gas electricity that dirties the air in our neighborhoods and endangers our planet.”</p>
<p>Combined, the awarded Clean Path NY (CPNY) project, developed by Forward Power (a joint venture of Invenergy and EnergyRe) and the New York Power Authority, and Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE) project, developed by Transmission Developers, Inc. (backed by Blackstone) and Hydro-Québec will: produce approximately 18 million megawatt-hours of upstate and Canadian renewable energy per year, enough to power more than 2.5 million homes; reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 77 million metric tons over the next 15 years, the equivalent of taking one million cars off the road; and provide $2.9 billion in public health benefits over 15 years that will result from reduced exposure to harmful pollutants.</p>
<p>CPNY and CHPE will invest approximately $460 million in community benefit funds to create pathways to green energy jobs, support public health, advance capital improvement projects, realize habitat restoration and improve the environmental footprint of buildings in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>The projects were selected for contract negotiation as part of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority&#8217;s (NYSERDA) Tier 4 renewable energy solicitation issued in January. Once finalized, NYSERDA will submit the negotiated contracts for these awarded projects to New York&#8217;s Public Service Commission for consideration and approval. If the Tier 4 contract is approved, NYSERDA payments under this award will not commence for each respective project until the project has obtained all required permits and local approvals, is constructed and delivers power to New York City, which is expected to begin in 2025 for CHPE and 2027 for CPNY.</p>
<p>CPNY&#8217;s 174-mile transmission line will run from the Fraser Substation in Delaware County to the Rainey Substation in Queens, utilizing a buried cable using existing rights-of-way, which will mitigate potential local community impacts, avoid sensitive habitats along the Hudson River, and be more resilient than above-ground alternatives in the face of severe weather and security threats.</p>
<p>CHPE is a permitted 339-mile buried cable, both underground and underwater, transmission line that runs from Hydro-Quebec&#8217;s wind and hydropower resources in the Province of Quebec to the Astoria Energy Center in Queens, NY and has adopted best management practices to avoid, minimize and mitigate environmental damages, including impacts on sensitive species and habitats.</p>
<p>NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said of the selection of the two projects, “Investing now in these major renewable energy infrastructure projects will bolster the state&#8217;s economic recovery at a time when New Yorkers truly need it and will accelerate our progress in providing clean, resilient, renewable energy to some of the state&#8217;s most densely-polluted and underserved communities.”</p>
<p>Hydro Quebec CEO Sophie Brochu and Transmission Developers CEO Don Jessome said, &#8220;We are honored that Quebec hydropower, delivered over our permitted, fully buried, construction-ready transmission project has been chosen to join other important renewable projects as the State and City work toward achieving their climate mandates. We commend Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their clean energy leadership and we look forward to quickly delivering the project&#8217;s immense clean energy benefits and new jobs to State. We are deeply grateful for the many labor organizations, environmental stewards and municipalities throughout the state that have supported this project.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clean Path NY leaders Jeff Blau of energyRe, Michael Polsky of Invenergy, and Gil C. Quiniones of the New York Power Authority said, &#8220;Clean Path NY is the most significant U.S. renewable energy infrastructure investment in this century and a defining project for the advancement of clean energy in New York &#8211; one that will dramatically reduce carbon emissions, catalyze green jobs across the state, provide crucial environmental justice benefits and fundamentally change the way our State is powered. Pairing innovative wind, solar, and storage projects with state-of-the art transmission to bring clean energy directly to New York City, Clean Path NY will be a truly transformative renewable energy project.”</p>
<p>If approved, the CPNY and CHPE projects will add to New York&#8217;s existing pipeline of large-scale renewable energy, comprised of nearly 100 solar, land-based wind and offshore wind projects totaling 11,000 megawatts of clean power—enough to power more than five million homes when completed. The state&#8217;s commitment to building out new green energy transmission, led by 250 miles of new major upgrades already underway throughout the state and reinforced by this award will allow the current pipeline of renewables to power nearly 60% of New York&#8217;s electricity from renewable energy once operational.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>MIDDLETOWN—If any attendees at the Sept. 21 Investor Breakfast of the Orange County Partnership were questioning the strength of the county’s economy, any misgivings were wiped away by the breadth of the positive data and forecasts offered by economic development, government and business experts at the event.</p>
<p>Orange County Partnership President and CEO Maureen Halahan noted that the county is seeing significant development interest and numerous firms are seeking municipal approvals for projects ranging in size from 60,000 square feet to 1 million square feet.</p>
<p>Halahan said that at present, the growth clusters in Orange County are: tourism, health care, distribution and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus pulled no punches, reporting that sales taxes in Orange County are up 25% from last year and agreed with Halahan that investment interest in Orange County is very high.</p>
<p>“There is a massive land grab going on throughout the county,” Neuhaus said. “People wanting to buy property, investing and going before Planning Boards.”</p>
<p>He also said that the county is working with the Department of Labor to prompt those who left their jobs due to the pandemic to return to work if they are able.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker at the event held at the West Hills Country Club that was attended by 275 people, was Gus Scacco, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Hudson Valley Investment Advisors, Inc. of Goshen, a subsidiary of Orange County Bancorp, Inc.</p>
<p>Scacco noted that demand is very strong and what is holding back economic growth are supply bottle necks. “You don’t confuse slowing sales with what is happening now because demand is tremendous” he said. “You can’t find employees, you can’t get a reservation, you can’t buy a car, you can’t find a house. Those don’t happen when you are having bad economic times.” He termed current economic conditions as “very robust” and noted that there are indications that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic may be behind us.</p>
<p>He noted that supply constraints are putting downward pressure on growth. Scacco said that at present there are 60 large container ships sitting out in the waters off the port Long Beach, CA waiting to be off loaded. Normally, there are just three to five container ships waiting for longshoremen to offload their cargo.</p>
<p>Another impediment to growth for the national and regional economy is the shortage of computer chips, which has, for example, caused used car prices to rise by 30%. Scacco said there are signs that the computer chip shortage may be dissipating.</p>
<div id="attachment_38198" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38198" class="wp-image-38198" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Neuhaus.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-38198" class="wp-caption-text">Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus</p></div>
<p>He said that inventories are very low and will likely take about a year to recover. Scacco predicted that supply chains will begin to turn to normal levels in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of the housing market, Scacco said that the combination of low inventory and high demand, particularly among first time homebuyers will fuel a continued strong housing market for some time to come.</p>
<p>Another positive for the housing market, include continued migration of city residents to suburbs like Orange County.</p>
<p>“If you are a builder, this is probably the best time you have ever seen or will see for a long period of time,” Scacco predicted.</p>
<p>He agreed with Neuhaus and Halahan and said that there is a major push on the commercial construction for the development of warehouse space across the nation.</p>
<p>Another key positive indicator that spells good news for real estate investors and the overall economy is that the personal savings rate is currently at a record high of 15%. He said that the high personal savings rate is a key reason why some people have yet to return to work despite the abundance of open job positions.</p>
<p>“People are sitting with a lot of money in their pockets and they want to spend it,” he said.</p>
<p>He concluded his remarks by again reiterating that slow sales are not the real indicator of where the economy is and is heading in 2022.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous, tremendous buoyancy in the economy on a nationwide basis,” Scacco said. “The biggest thing that is holding us up are bottle necks in terms of logistics and the ability to get stuff. If you are a contractor waiting trying to get wire, you are waiting for a product at home or you are looking to add an employee, those are the things that we think will let up over the next six to eight months and keep the economy running.”</p>
<p>The Orange County Partnership’s next major event will be its Annual Event held on Tuesday, Dec. 7 at the recently opened The Barn at Villa Venezia in the Town of Wallkill. At the program, which will begin at 5 p.m., the Orange County Partnership will announce the winners of its 2021 Quality of Life Award, Spirit of Innovation Award and the Alliance for Balanced Growth’s Golden Shovel Award.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—Ever since the COVID-19 hit this region back in March 2020, one of the bright spots for the Hudson Valley economy has been Orange County where, despite the challenges the pandemic has brought, major projects and investment continue almost undeterred.</p>
<p>Orange County has seen Amazon and Medline build new massive distribution facilities, while the much-anticipated LEGOLAND New York opened for business recently to much fanfare. Even the struggling hospitality sector is rebounding, with many new hotel projects in the ground or on the drawing boards and reports that on weekends no hotel room can be found within the borders of the county.</p>
<p>This month, Real Estate In-Depth turned to Orange County Partnership President and Chief Executive Officer Maureen Halahan to find out where the economy is in its recovery from COVID-19 and what growth sectors have emerged.</p>
<p>She was also questioned on the challenges the county faces and the prospects on whether the long hoped for expansion of Route 17 will move forward and break ground.</p>
<p>Halahan, who was born and raised in the Hudson Valley, is one of the most recognizable faces in economic development in the region and the state. She became the President and CEO of the Orange County Partnership in 2002, making her the longest serving economic development professional in the Mid-Hudson Region.</p>
<p>She is a long-standing member of the Governor’s Mid-Hudson Regional Council and also serves on the Citizens Advisory Panel – New York Stewart International Airport. Halahan is a member of the New York State Economic Development Council, CoreNet International, an international site-selection industry association and the 17Forward86 coalition, which the Orange County Partnership was instrumental in founding.</p>
<p>In the past five years, the Orange County Partnership has assisted with the attraction and/or expansion of 99 companies. These transactions have generated $902,446,000 in capital investment and created 3,146 new jobs in Orange County.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The Orange County economy has been on the road to recovery for the past year or so. The latest unemployment statistics from the New York State Department of Labor indicate that the jobless rate in the county as of July had fallen from 12.4% in 2020 to 5.3% this year. Can you describe the impact COVID had on the Orange County market and share your view on the health of the county’s economy today?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-38220" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MAUREEN-HALAHAN-HEADSHOT.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="277" />Halahan: </strong>Key indicators show that things are definitely coming back. The Hospitality industry is reopening and venues are booking up years in advance. People are getting out again. The demand for more product is happening and while the supply is not sufficient, it’s going to come around again. Hotels that are either under construction or in the planning stages are developing faster than we can keep up with. Right now, in Orange County on the weekends you can’t get a room. So, on the hospitality side we see a tremendous amount of growth.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Another indicator that proves that we are moving toward a healthy economy is the amount of SPEC (speculative) construction and that is taking place throughout the county. Developers are constructing industrial buildings prior to securing an end-user. In most cases, the buildings are fully leased before the roof is on. That kind of confidence is also reflected in the number of national developers that are before planning boards seeking generic approvals. They are investing millions of dollars preparing land for construction without knowing who will take the space.</p>
<p>One such national developer is proposing two separate 1-million-square-foot e-commerce centers in a town that recognizes the value of the jobs and tax ratables that will follow. Orange County is facing a time in history where we have to seize the momentum and we are! Municipalities want the growth in their designated corridors. We are seeing a considerable amount of retail, pharmaceutical and distribution. Both Medline and Cardinal Health, long-standing companies that have enjoyed success in Orange County, are expanding. So, it’s not all new attractions. Our current companies are growing at the same rate. And, it’s not just the million-square-footers, there are dozens of smaller requirements that are building-to-suit.</p>
<p>Things are happening quickly. The big story is the developers are getting their approvals and next year construction is going to explode. I hope we have enough workers to build and construct these projects.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The Orange County Partnership has been a strong proponent of major improvements and an expansion to be undertaken on Route 17 from Harriman to Monticello. Preliminary cost estimates have put the cost of the project as high as more than $1 billion. Is this project feasible and do you expect the federal infrastructure bill to direct some funding for the Route 17 expansion?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-38224" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CID-ROUTE-17-GROUP-SHOT.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="277" /> Halahan: </strong>The $1-billion estimate is only if it goes literally from Harriman straight through to Monticello. That’s why that number is so explosive. That cost estimate assumes that the road needs to be widened without the use of the median and by purchasing all those additional right-of-ways. So, that is why that number is so much greater than the anticipated $500 million. There are cost estimates that are half of that because we don’t know if the New York State Department of Transportation will determine that it’s needed to go the entire route.</p>
<p>The $500-million we believe is still the number if the DOT is allowed to use the median. On the federal side, U.S. Sen. (Charles) Schumer has been a staunch supporter of the project. He remains engaged. He has been a long-time proponent and we are optimistic that the funds will be available to allow the project to go forward. We believe it is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What are the growth sectors that your organization is focusing on in Orange County? There has been a significant amount of new projects throughout the county of late. Can you explain why investors have chosen Orange County for their developments, particularly as the hotel/hospitality industry continues to suffer from low demand due to the pandemic?</p>
<p><strong>Halahan:</strong> Regionally speaking, we are still less expensive (than other competing markets) and Orange County has an abundance of supportive infrastructure. What people don’t see is the number of small- to mid-sized manufacturers in Orange County. Our portfolio is rich with new projects and existing assembly and manufacturing businesses. What hits the paper is the big explosive projects like Amazon or Medline and others. For instance, we are working with a truck chassis assembly manufacturer in New Windsor. New Windsor Supervisor George Meyers likes the location—it’s zoned appropriately and we hope it’s another win for Orange County. The New Jersey-based company found the location attractive and we were more affordable than New Jersey. Phase two of its overall plan is to construct a larger building on the site next year. This multiplier effect puts people to work and strengthens our economy.</p>
<p>Breweries are big and they are popping up all over. The Mid-Hudson Regional Council just deemed one of the breweries in the Town of Wallkill a significant priority project. And marijuana is a burgeoning industry with several projects in various stages of development and planning. It’s everywhere, but in this county, it is big. Yesterday, Green Thumb Industries broke ground on their project in Warwick…</p>
<p>Other projects of note include the Sims-Foster Supply (Grand Street project) in the City of Newburgh, which was also deemed a priority by the Mid-Hudson Regional Council. Sims Foster out of Sullivan County is going to be redeveloping the Masonic Hall, the American Legion and the YMCA (in Newburgh). They are going to be pumping millions and millions of dollars into the city and the multiplier in terms of outside dollars being spent in the city is a big number. Recently, we also had City Winery open in Montgomery and the Barn at Villa Venezia (a new hospitality venue) in the Town of Wallkill debuted.</p>
<p>The film industry is growing in Orange County. You have Choice Films in New Windsor. They are going to take over the Anthony’s Pier 9 building and that is going to pour a ton of money into our economy. Also, we recently met with the Dino Park, which will be built in the Town of Wallkill…</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-38225" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NEUHAUS-HALAHAN.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="375" />Editor’s Note:</strong> Halahan added that with the Dino Park, LEGOLAND New York, the Castle, and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, “We are becoming more and more of a destination.”</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What are some of the critical issues facing Orange County in the years ahead: the future growth of New York Stewart International Airport, transportation, regulatory reform, high business costs?</p>
<p><strong>Halahan: </strong>So, we know that Stewart Airport is underutilized and it has been forever. We also know that Westchester County Airport is at capacity. Parking has become a challenge at Westchester County Airport and there is an abundance of parking at Stewart. Both airports are regional in nature so we have to work together so that both airports thrive and serve the Hudson Valley at optimum capacity. We need to partner, similar to the way we approached the 17-Forward-86 initiative where Orange and Sullivan counties worked together. After we come up with a strategy regionally, we have to sit down with the Port Authority in order to start balancing (air travel at Port Authority airports). People want to fly out of Stewart and Westchester. We owe it to our regional residents to make it balanced and affordable with choices of carriers. I’m told that half of the Port Authority Board has never even visited Stewart Airport. That’s unacceptable! The Partnership has invited them several times to host one of its Board meetings at Stewart. We have to get them more engaged because it is such an asset to them and they don’t recognize it.</p>
<p>On the high cost of business, that is a policy issue. The fact is that Orange County is competitive regionally and we are doing OK. Our local taxes are not the problem. It’s the regulations that kill us. We lost our common sense. If we continue to make New York unaffordable for companies to come here, we will continue to watch our numbers go down. The overall business climate is something that we continue to work on with our state leadership. We are hopeful with the new administration. (Governor) Kathy Hochul is a huge small business proponent. She understands small businesses. She understands her challenges too. We hope that we are going to be able to continue to work with her as she has visited Orange County dozens of times—we have a good relationship with her.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In looking back on the past 18 months of the pandemic, is there any event or moment that affected the Partnership the most and has there been anything positive to come out of this that you can point to?</p>
<p><strong>Halahan:</strong> We (the Orange County Partnership staff) were here until the last possible moment and then had to work from home because we didn’t want to break the rules. The good thing that came out of “the Great Shutdown” is that every one of us over the years had been able to work from a remote location, myself included. We had to learn Zoom and Microsoft Teams and all of those other things, but we were no strangers to remote technology and we were very productive right out the gate. Thank God we have a very diverse group. We have young people on my team who set us up right away and made sure we were cross trained. I’m proud to admit that the very first day that we were allowed to come back to the office, every member of this team wanted to.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-38217" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JVP_0035.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /></p>
<p>So, that is what I learned. I learned from my team that a) we took the proper precautions, b) they wanted to be here at the office so I didn’t have to fight some of the challenges other organizations did and c) we worked well together from home. Look, does anyone get an eight-hour day from their staff when they are working from home? My team proved it is possible. I think that we were highly effective during that time. We started our new newsletter during that time, which was probably one of the most significant things we have done to engage our local community. The newsletter has been well received and we get a lot of feedback from our readers. We were able to connect our investors and our local business community by continuing to feed them information that impacts their bottom line…</p>
<p>Also, the second the governor gave the okay, we resumed in-person events. We had our MVP (Most Valuable Partner) event, which the attendance numbers equaled 2019 as did our income from that event. The Partnership has never been one to hold golf outings or outdoor events, but this past May we held our first Golf Outing and sold out two golf courses. We have already sold all of the sponsorships for the 2022 Golf Outing. It was that successful! Now we have three golf courses reserved for 2022. It was not only fun, we were able to get people together safely, they made business connections and they had fun! It was a home run!</p>
<p>We have our Investor Breakfast coming up and judging from the RSVPs we have received so far, a good amount of people have signed up for it. We will see if the (Delta) variant continues to haunt us. But, the numbers are going down, people are planning ahead for events, we are selling sponsorships and we believe our Annual event in December at the Barn at Villa Venezia will be a smashing success.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Longtime and Respected Association CEO P. Gilbert Mercurio Passes Away]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A man who for more than three decades was a driving force behind the growth and growing respect of the Westchester County Board of Realtors has died.</p>
<p>P. Gilbert Mercurio, who led the Westchester County Board of Realtors and its successor organization the Westchester Putnam Association of Realtors for 31 years as its chief executive officer, passed away on Sept. 27th at the age of 78.</p>
<p>He headed the organizations from 1980 through the end of 2011. Mercurio was well respected in the real estate industry as well as in political and business circles and was called upon by municipal, county, state and federal leaders for his business and economic knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>In his last year as CEO in 2011, Mercurio supervised the preparations for the merger of the Westchester-Putnam operations with the Realtor organizations and multiple listing services representing Rockland and Orange counties, creating the 11th  largest Realtor association in the USA with more than 9,500 individual members and more than1,000 Realtor offices. The new entity, Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc., came into existence on Jan. 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Mercurio penned an article in <em>Westchester Realtor</em> and its successor publication <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> entitled “Up Front” for all 31 years of his association with the Westchester County Board of Realtors.</p>
<p>During Mercurio’s tenure with the WCBR and later WPAR. the organizations were particularly instrumental in proposing and successfully advocating for strong consumer protection measures adopted in New York State including mandatory property conditions disclosure, mandatory real estate agency disclosure, higher standards for the licensing and continuing education of real estate licensees and mandatory special training in fair housing practices.</p>
<p>Those who worked with Mercurio over the years expressed shock at his passing and offered high praise for this man who mentored many into leadership positions in the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors CEO Richard Haggerty said, “He was a true visionary leader and one of the most intelligent and thoughtful individuals I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He was a friend and mentor to countless members as well as staff.” Mercurio strongly recommended Haggerty to the Board of Directors back in 2011 to be his successor.</p>
<p>Former WCBR and NYSAR President Savo Fries said of her longtime friend, “One of the most brilliant, articulate and loving persons I have ever met. Once you were Gil’s friend, you were Gil’s friend for life. I will admire him always. I learned so many things from him. I will never forget him.”</p>
<p>Fries said that while Mercurio kept a façade of being serious and always professional, there was another side of him that many were able to experience. “I was fortunate to know the real Gil, the caring and loving person that he was.”</p>
<p>J.P. Endres, another former WCBR President, said that Mercurio supported her successful candidacy for NYSAR President and accompanied her to most of her interviews throughout the state. When she was deciding whether to run for the position, Mercurio provided some encouraging words, saying, “You are going to make Westchester proud.” Noting that she began her real estate career at a relatively young age, Endres recalls that Mercurio guided her through the learning process of understanding association rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Endres, who now serves as branch manager for Howard Hanna | Rand Realty’s New City office, said, “This man had such a love for the industry and such a deep devotion and interest in the proper business of the community, the county and how the Board of Realtors fit in with that.”</p>
<p>She added, “He was the most well-read, well-versed, well-spoken individual that I can honestly say I have met in my entire career who had the knowledge that he possessed about the economics of the county, the business growth and real estate. He was ever so brilliant, ever so eloquent and the most caring man that I have ever met.”</p>
<p>Former Orange County Association of Realtors CEO Ann Garti and Mercurio literally took over their respective CEO positions at about the same time in 1980. Garti, who recently retired as COO of HGAR, told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, “He was my role model. When he and I agreed on something, I always knew I was on the right track. He was incredibly smart. One of the most articulate people I’ve known certainly and despite all that or maybe because of it, he was a very kind person and was always willing to share the benefits of his expertise.” She later said simply of her longtime friend: “He was one of a kind.”</p>
<p>Mercurio was very active in his Realtor association management profession. He served on many committees of the New York State Association of Realtors including Executive, Finance, and Legislation. He was the founding chairman of the Association Executives Committee of that organization. He was a member of the State and Local Issues Committee of the National Association of Realtors and he held the Omega Tau Rho designation of that organization, signifying exceptional service.</p>
<p>From 1973 to 1980, Mercurio was Director of Research and Planning for the Westchester County Association and the World Trade Club of Westchester. Previously he was an urban planner for a private consulting firm as well as the Bergen County and Westchester County Planning Departments, the latter from 1970 to 1973, during which time he worked on and authored parts of the county’s initial master plan titled “Urban Form.” His urban planning degree was from the School of Architecture of Columbia University.</p>
<p>Mercurio had an extensive record of participation in the business and civic life of Westchester County including former service as a Director of the Westchester Housing Fund, Westchester Housing Forum, Westchester Equity Fund, and Westchester Partnership for Economic Development; Chairman of the Urban Centers Task Force of the Westchester 2000 project; President of a White Plains neighborhood association; member of the original County Commission on the Homeless, White Plains Planning Board, Housing Action Council, and White Plains Housing Information Service, among many other organizations. He also served as a trustee of the Westchester County Historical Society.</p>
<p>Mercurio was born on Aug. 2, 1943. A graduate of Regis High School and Columbia University, he was a 1968 combat veteran of the Vietnam War and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Army Commendation Medal. He married Sharon Kay Finley in 1970, who survives him. He was a loving husband, father and grandfather and will be greatly missed by his family and friends. He is survived by his wife Sharon, children: Claudia (Alex); Curtis and Douglas and grandchildren: David, Emilia, Logan, Gavin and Quentin.</p>
<p>Visitation for Gil will be held on Friday, Oct. 1 at the Ballard-Durand Funeral &amp; Cremation Services, 2 Maple Ave., White Plains from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The eviction moratorium has gone on for longer than it should have. While the pandemic is still with us, New York has been opening up. The virus is now likely to become “endemic” meaning that it is a condition we have to live with and adjust to.</p>
<p>Legislation to provide rental aid has been passed, however only around 10% of the money has actually been utilized. This is due to website errors, unreasonable requirements for the application, and the fact that a landlord has to go through the tenant in order to receive the aid. There is currently a bill in Congress to try and rectify these issues, but the bill is in the financial services committee and has not yet been authorized.</p>
<p>This, along with “Good Cause Eviction,” violates private property rights. We must continue to lobby to correct these issues. Good Cause Eviction takes away a landlord’s ability to set the terms of their lease. This is in itself, a violation of contracts. We should continue to work to change this. Thankfully, we do have allies in the legislature who agree with us on this issue. It would hurt the marketplace by capping rents at around 3% or the CPI as good cause eviction does. This will depress investment.</p>
<p>Another venue is the courts. The Community Housing Improvement Program, RSA and other organizations have filed lawsuits against the state eviction moratorium. The federal eviction moratorium was struck down. This was a major victory for private property rights federally.</p>
<p>Let your Senators and Assembly members know that you oppose “Good Cause” eviction and the eviction moratorium. Stay tuned for updates on these issues.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Third quarter residential home sales for the Lower Hudson region, served by OneKey Multiple Listing Service, surpassed the historically high third quarter sales figures of 2020 which were attributed in large part to a response to COVID-19, according to the <strong><a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2021-3rd-Quarter-Report-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Third Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report for Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx counties</a></strong> released on Oct. 6.</p>
<p>Although some sales, no doubt, were still a result of buyers’ desire for more space, both indoors and out as a result of COVID, there appears to be organic growth occurring, as well. Residential sales figures for all counties in the region, with the exception of Sullivan County, were up from the third quarter of 2020. The median price of a single-family home rose in every county.</p>
<p>Westchester County experienced an increase of 9% in single-family home sales to 2,377 units from 2,181 units in 2020, Q3. There was an increase of 5.6% in the county’s median sale price to $855,000 from $810,000 in the third quarter of 2020. While Orange County inexplicably saw a decrease of 1.3% in single-family home sales, 1,180 sales as compared to 1,196 in 2020, the median price increased 16.7% to $385,000, an historic high, from $330,000 in the third quarter of 2020. Orange County has been suffering from a dearth of inventory, which appears to be inhibiting sales.</p>
<p>In Putnam County, single-family residential sales numbered 364 units up 3.4% from third quarter 2020 sales of 352 units. The median sales price increased 13.3% to $466,500 from $411,750. Rockland County single-family home sales increased by 5.6% to 715 units from 677 units in the third quarter of last year. The median sales price increased 13.5% to $579,000 from $510,000 in 2020.</p>
<p>Bronx County, which was more directly impacted by COVID-19 than the more suburban counties, had a 42.9% increase in single-family residential sales to 170 units from 119 in the third quarter of 2020. The median single-family home sales price in the Bronx rose 13.8% to $597,500 from $525,000 in 2020. While single-family sales were down 24% due to low inventory in Sullivan County, prices rose a significant 25.8% to $250,250 from $199,000 in the previous year.</p>
<p>On a percentage basis, condominium and co-op sales stole the show in the third quarter. Co-op sales which had been lagging, even pre COVID, in Westchester took on a life of their own increasing by 67.4% to 569 co-op sales as compared to 340 in the third quarter of last year. Co-op prices rose 11.1% to $200,000 from $180,000 in 2020. Condominium sales in Westchester, for the quarter, rose 44.4% to 488 units from 338 last year. Condominium sales were up 40.3% in Rockland County (202 units vs, 144 in 2020) with prices increasing 13% to $309,950 from $274,000 in 2020, Q3. In Orange County sales of condominiums increased 29% from 2020, Q3 (178 vs. 138). Condominium and co-op sales also rose in Bronx County with condo sales up 129.4% to 78 from 34 the previous year with a small price decrease of 4.2%. Co-op sales were up 108% for the quarter (196 vs. 94) with prices increasing 3.7% to $245,000 from $236,250. In Putnam County, condominium sales increased 26% to 63 units from 50 in 2020, Q3. The median sale price rose to $300,000 from $248,500 in 2020 an increase of 20.7%. These significant increases in unit sales can be attributed, at least in part, to the lower cost of purchase of co-op and condominium units particularly in view of the seemingly unending price increases in single-family dwellings.</p>
<p>Multi-family sales showed surprising strength in every county where units sales and prices increased in every county except for a small price decrease (2.8%) in Rockland County. Orange County was up 107%; Rockland County 115.4%; Bronx County, 4.7%; Sullivan County, 12.5%; Putnam County, (with a small number of units) 300% and Westchester, 79.2%.</p>
<p>With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, the real estate market has been an anomaly outperforming the economy. Sales and prices have enjoyed a trajectory, which is likely unsustainable going forward, however the economy of the Hudson Valley continues to improve and grow more vibrant, which bodes well for real estate. It is likely that price increases will moderate and additional product will come on the market, which will sustain a strong market in the near term.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Back in 2019, the New York legislature enacted a broad new law that provided sweeping housing reforms and protections for tenants relating to permanent residential housing. Among these rent regulations was one that caught many landlords and real estate agents by surprise and I am still asked, nearly two years later, to confirm or explain this rule. That rule, found under subsection 1 of Section 7-108 of the General Obligation Law was:</p>
<p>No deposit or advance shall exceed the amount of one month’s rent.</p>
<p>This provision meant that a landlord or his/her agent cannot require a tenant to provide more than one month’s rent as an advance in total on the rental of a residential property. It meant that if a landlord were to hold one month’s rent as security, they could not charge a last month’s rental fee, a pet fee, a move-in fee, or a myriad of other financial advances designed to protect the landlord. This simple sentence, in one fell swoop, changed how landlords operated. With the passing of this law, landlords were no longer financially protected and they could be left in a dire financial situation if they encountered a bad tenant. More importantly, some landlords, who operated seasonal rentals, were left in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>The model for seasonal rentals is simple: the renter pays for the entire time they are going to use the rental unit up front. A two-month rental requires two months’ rent up front, and usually a deposit/damage fee, which is refunded at the end of the rental term after the rental is cleaned and examined for damage. Similarly, full summer rentals required the entire rental amount (or sometimes one half) up front. However, with the advent of the 2019 rent regulations, a landlord in the Hamptons, for example, could not rent his summer property and require the full amount up front. The landlord would have to enter into a lease agreement with the renter and collect the money at the beginning of each month and they could not hold more than one month’s rent as security. Not only did this arrangement create problems financially, particularly if the landlord was renting a spacious luxury property, but it also created some potential legal problems as well.</p>
<p>In an effort to carve-out these seasonal rentals, a bill was proposed to the New York legislature and it passed both houses and was signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sept. 30, 2021. The amendment, known as the Seasonal Use Dwelling Unit (SUDU) amendment was made effective immediately. <strong>This amendment allows seasonal use rental landlords to charge more than one month’s rent as security or as an advance</strong>. If a landlord wishes to avail themselves of the SUDU amendment and charge more than one month’s rent in advance, they must comply with several requirements. They are:</p>
<p>The local government, county, or state agency must have established a registry of seasonal rental units;</p>
<p>The seasonal rental unit must be registered with the established registry;</p>
<p>The lease must expressly provide that:</p>
<p>• The seasonal rental unit is registered on the registry and provide the agency where it is registered;</p>
<p>• The lease must state that the occupancy is for a seasonal term not to exceed 120 days;</p>
<p>• The tenant must have a primary residence to return to, with that address provided in the lease.</p>
<p>• The unit cannot be rented for more than 120 days each calendar year.</p>
<p>The amendment provides that if the landlord of the property does not adhere to these provisions, the local government, county, or state agency is authorized to revoke the seasonal use dwelling unit’s registration.</p>
<p>While this amendment is very straightforward and is a benefit to certain landlords, there are a few problems that are raised as well. The SUDU amendment requires the establishment of a seasonal rental registry by a local, county, or state agency. NYSAR has opined that it is doubtful that the state will establish such a registry and believes that a seasonal rental registry will need to be established by local or county governments. How and when that takes place is to be seen and it is suggested that landlords reach out to their representatives to initiate and/or promote the establishment of these registries. Until that time where a registry is created, no landlord can avail themselves of the new amendment and charge more than one month’s rent as an advance.</p>
<p>Another issue is that while seasonal rentals of 120 days or less are covered under this provision, other rentals that extend beyond 120 days are not covered. Many landlords that provide housing for college students rent in a similar fashion to seasonal rentals. They too were impacted by the 2019 rent regulations; however, because they rent for a period in excess of 120 days, they are not covered under the new SUDU amendment. Additionally, many landlords that rent on a short-term basis to business people who are relocating or are assigned to a New York location on a temporary basis follow a similar model as seasonal rentals. They cannot take advantage of the SUDU amendment if the lease is greater than 120 days. Presently, there is no legislation on the horizon comparable to the SUDU amendment that may assist these landlords in securing their financial investments.</p>
<p>The SUDU amendment is a benefit to a specific segment of landlords, if and only if a seasonal registry can be created and the SUDU landlords comply with the requirements of the amendment. The amendment itself resolves the overlooked seasonal rental industry problem that was created by the 2019 rent regulations; however, it ignores other similarly-situated short-term rental industry landlords that still struggle with the 2019 rent regulation restrictions. Whether new legislation is proposed to help these landlords or broaden the scope of the SUDU amendment is to be seen, but at least the SUDU amendment has passed and we will all watch to see how things develop.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The real estate industry has certainly been through a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, many real estate agents and brokerage firms faced the real concern that the entire real estate market was on the brink of collapse. The panic that had set in quickly subsided and, surprisingly, the real estate market took off in many markets following the initial lockdown orders issued in March in New York and surrounding states. Many left the densely populated urban areas for a more rural setting and employees began working remotely. As a result, the New York City market was hit particularly hard and has lagged in the recovery in comparison to other areas.</p>
<p>As a result of the market conditions, many real estate brokerage firms have effectuated key mergers and acquisitions, and entered into strategic partnerships. The pandemic caused companies to seriously consider consolidation with other firms to solidify established market share or to simply sell their assets to or merge with other companies to firm up operations that were impacted by the pandemic. This article will focus on key aspects to be considered when contemplating a merger or acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Mergers, Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships in 2020 and 2021</strong></p>
<p>Some of the notable mergers and acquisitions that occurred during 2020 and 2021 include: (1) Brown Harris Steven merger with Halstead (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3iMhKyb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3iMhKyb</a>), (2) RE/Max Holdings acquisition of RE/Max Integra, (3) Compass acquisition of Bold New York (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3oObHgk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3oObHgk</a>), (4) Corcoran Group merger with Citi Habitats, (5) Keller Williams NYC merger with two franchises, Tribeca and Midtown (see <a href="https://bit.ly/2YICyzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2YICyzy</a>), (6) the acquisition of RentPath by Redfin (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3mFMwK5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3mFMwK5</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3DAecXP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3DAecXP</a>); and (7) the creation of a new strategic partnership between Howard Hanna Real Estate Services and Rand Realty, to operate as Howard Hanna Rand Realty (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3arWbhH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3arWbhH</a>). Howard Hanna Rand Realty also announced a partnership with Plawker Real Estate, based in Bergen County, NJ (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3at9I8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3at9I8I</a>). In addition, Realogy announced on October 5th that it would be acquiring Warburg Realty, one of the oldest and most prominent residential real estate brokerage firms in New York City (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3ar7PcT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ar7PcT</a>).</p>
<p>These are just a few of the major transactions announced over the past two years, but many smaller mergers and acquisitions have occurred, and more will surely take place in the coming months and years as the trend toward consolidation grows.</p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations When Contemplating a Merger: Acquisition/Sale or Strategic Partnership</strong></p>
<p>Before contemplating a merger, acquisition/sale or other strategic partnership, brokerages must consider a multitude of issues and should perform extensive due diligence. The National Association of Realtors offers invaluable resources and useful guidance for brokerage firms interested in mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3lv3Z8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3lv3Z8B</a>). It is also important for firms to engage accounting and legal professionals before discussing any potential transaction with another party.</p>
<p>One of the resources cited by NAR is an article published in <em>Forbes</em> entitled “<em>A Comprehensive Guide to Due Diligence Issues in Mergers and Acquisitions</em>” (the “Forbes Guidance”) (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3arasuX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3arasuX</a>). The article points out that “before committing to the transaction, the buyer will want to ensure that it knows what it is buying, what obligations it is assuming, the nature and extent of the seller’s contingent liabilities, problematic contracts, litigation risks, intellectual property issues, and much more. This is particularly true in private company acquisitions….” As the Forbes Guidance highlights, conducting extensive and comprehensive due diligence is a critical element of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, especially where privately-owned companies (i.e., non-publicly traded companies) are involved. Below are just some of the important items to be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality: The Non-Disclosure Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Before a firm commences negotiations or discussions, it is imperative that a mutual confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement be executed by the parties involved. There are many complex provisions, particularly survival, injunctive relief, and other remedy provisions in an NDA that should be reviewed and carefully drafted by legal counsel with experience in contract and mergers and acquisition law. If these provisions are not drafted correctly it could allow for highly sensitive and confidential information to be released and exposed to others in instances where a transaction falls through. No information should be exchanged unless and until the NDA is executed and delivered by all parties involved.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Due Diligence and Contract Review</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important items of due diligence is the review of the financial condition of the companies involved in a particular transaction. It is common for companies to exchange at least three years (more is recommended, if available) of financial data and information. It is strongly recommended that firms review the following financial data: (1) audited, if available, or unaudited, and accountant-prepared, financial statements, (2) corporate, partnership or limited liability company tax returns, (3) profit and loss statements, (4) statements of assets and liabilities and (5) schedules of liens, debts, and other liabilities (contingent and current).</p>
<p>Firms must review all contracts and agreements, including any loan documentation, lease agreements (relating to office space, equipment, vehicles, and other items), agreements with service providers and software providers, and any other agreements, that are to be included in the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Client and Customer Base: Understanding Business Generation</strong></p>
<p>It is important for companies to review the customer base and list of pending and closed transactions. According to the Forbes Guidance, “the buyer will want to fully understand the seller’s customer base, including the level of concentration of the largest customers as well as the sales in the pipeline.” The Forbes Guidance lists the following topics of concern:</p>
<p>• What customer concentration issues/risks are there?</p>
<p>• Will there be any issues in keeping customers after the acquisition (including issues relating to who the buyer is)?</p>
<p>• How satisfied are the customers with their relationship with the seller? (Customer calls will often be appropriate.)</p>
<p>• What are the sales terms/policies?</p>
<p>• How are salespeople compensated/motivated, and what effect will the transaction have on the financial incentives offered to employees?</p>
<p>Another important consideration includes a review of lead generation policies currently implemented by the seller and/or buyer. It is important to review, for example, exclusive agency agreements with large real estate developers involving new construction projects, and landlord clients for rentals, which will provide invaluable insight into future revenue generation.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Culture a Good Fit?</strong></p>
<p>One major consideration is whether the “organizational cultures” of the respective firms are compatible. The most common concerns that firms have when contemplating a merger, acquisition or partnership are whether the agents will get along and whether the management will remain. According to Gallup, in an article entitled “<em>How to Make Organizational Culture Part of M&amp;A Due Diligence</em>,” most mergers and acquisitions fail because companies “ignore organizational culture” (see<a href="https://bit.ly/3mILQUk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/3mILQUk</a>).</p>
<p>Gallup emphasizes that “deep dives into the cultures of both the acquiring and acquired companies are vital.” Gallup explains that the culture is usually considered to be either “tight” or “loose” and offers a real-life example where cultures clashed. Gallup explained that when Google acquired Nest, the acquisition failed because Google had a “loose” culture and Nest had a “tight” culture. Ultimately, because of this clash in cultures, Nest’s founders quit, and the transaction generated very little profit. In addition to organizational culture, Gallup recommends that companies should also consider the work style of the employees and agents. Gallup recommends that the leaders of each of the firms should carefully consider the two following concepts when negotiating a potential transaction:</p>
<p>“1. Organizational culture, or how the target company ‘does things around there.’ Are norms tightly enforced? Or are they loosely applied?</p>
<p>2. Work style, or how the organization prefers to distribute and complete the work. Do work orders flow down the org chart? Or is autonomy granted—and if so, to whom?”</p>
<p>Gallup explains that “mergers collapse when leaders fail to understand the cultural imperatives of the union of two organizations—or recognize that culture is omnipresent, invisible, complex and multilayered.” Gallup further points out that “…a framework that recognizes culture and work style as two different things and critically examines purpose, strategy, culture, brand and the employee experience—in tandem with other operational and financial measures—gives M&amp;As the best chance of success.”</p>
<p><strong>Considerations Regarding Employees, Key Management Personnel and Key Agents</strong></p>
<p>Other considerations that are closely related to the “culture” issue, are how to deal with announcing a potential transaction to key management personnel, employees, and agents, and to whom a transaction should be disclosed. It is not uncommon for the buyer or seller of a brokerage firm to want to refrain from announcing a potential transaction to agents, employees and/or key personnel until it is ready to close, or sometimes even wait until after the merger or acquisition is completed, due to fear that key personnel will leave.</p>
<p>However, if there are key agents, teams, or key management personnel that the parties deem essential to a transaction, it may be a good idea to have confidential conversations with these key individuals to ensure that they are aware of what is going on so that an effort can be made to have and request that they make a commitment to remain with the company after the transaction is closed. While every circumstance is different, this should be discussed with legal counsel early in the process. All employment and independent contractor agreements should be reviewed carefully. Compensation and commission arrangements are also a critical element to any real estate brokerage merger or acquisition. The parties must carefully consider the potential effects that any changes in compensation structure could have on the success of the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Licensing Status and Transfer Of Licenses to ‘New’ Brokerage</strong></p>
<p>It is important to review the full license history and complaint history, if any, of all agents transferring to the new company, to ensure that there are no pending or threatened actions or complaints filed with the Department of State or applicable governmental licensing authority, the local Realtor association, or similar entity against any agent. It is also important to include representations and indemnifications in any agreement relating to any such complaints or actions that are not resolved before the closing, or are not revealed, and any threatened or potential claims or issues that may exist.</p>
<p>Additionally, merger and acquisition transactions will require that the licenses be transferred to the “new” entity. In New York, this is usually a very involved process and needs to be coordinated with the appropriate personnel at the New York State Department of State, Division of Licensing. Depending on the number of agents, this can be very costly and should be investigated in advance. Additionally, corporate consents and resolutions need to be prepared by the parties’ counsel and approved in advance by the DOS in connection with the contemplated transaction. Appropriate corporate name change documentation and “doing business as” certificates will be required where the acquired entity will be operating under the acquiring entity’s business name, or vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property, Branding and Technology Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The Forbes Guidance also points out that the parties should conduct due diligence with respect to technology and intellectual property being transferred in connection a transaction. Some of the items of note include: (1) what trademarks and service marks the company has and whether they are included in the transaction; (2) what, if any, copyrighted works are owned by the firm; (3) potential infringement on intellectual property rights of third parties; (4) pending litigation with respect to intellectual property rights; (5) if there are software or technology rights being included in the transaction; and (6) the IT system currently utilized by the companies and the capacity to support the combined companies. These items, among others, should be reviewed carefully.</p>
<p>Reviewing cybersecurity issues and policies have also become an important aspect of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions transactions. Cybersecurity policies should be reviewed. Firms should request any information on data breaches that may have occurred and how they were addressed. Penalties and fines for not addressing such breaches could be significant. Again, these items must be discussed with legal counsel. Deloitte provides useful insight into conducting and understanding the concept of cybersecurity due diligence (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3oW6J1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3oW6J1c</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The Structure of Transaction</strong></p>
<p>Another critical element is determining the structure of the transaction. Mergers and acquisitions between larger, publicly-held companies, could include the purchase of the shares of a company or an outright merger of the two companies involved. In this instance, the company purchasing the target firm usually acquires all assets of the target firm as well as takes on responsibility for its liabilities. In many cases, the management team and ownership continue to be employed by the acquiring company.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most acquisitions involving smaller firms are structured as an asset purchase, whereby the purchasing firm only acquires the assets of the selling firm, and either takes on none of its liabilities or takes on only certain specified liabilities (e.g., loans, leases, employment agreements, etc.). Depending on the specific circumstances of the transaction, the acquiring company may purchase the assets directly, or set up a separate corporation or limited liability company to operate the newly acquired company. If there is a franchise involved, approval of the franchisor may be required for any transfer, whether a stock sale, merger or asset acquisition.</p>
<p>In other instances, two firms may decide to set up a strategic partnership, whereby each of the parties contribute specific assets (e.g., specific offices, areas, clientele, etc.) to a newly formed entity. The choice of entity is also a very important factor to consider. Parties may want to form a limited liability company or partnership (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3BDzQJW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3BDzQJW</a>) or a corporation (i.e., C-Corp or S-Corp) (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3v6QUWd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3v6QUWd</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3FCHTcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3FCHTcp</a>). The form of entity and structure of any transaction should be discussed with accounting professionals and legal counsel at the initial stages of any contemplated transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Considering a Sale or Acquisition is a Complex Endeavor</strong></p>
<p>The considerations and issues highlighted in this article are just a few of the many complexities that need to be addressed and investigated before beginning discussions with a potential seller or purchaser. The success of any merger, acquisition, or strategic partnership hinges on many elements, and if parties do contemplate a potential transaction, the more comprehensive the due diligence, the better the chance that a transaction will succeed.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Top experts from the housing and higher-education fields joined policy thought leaders from the National Association of Realtors on Oct. 13 to discuss the current student loan debt crisis and how it affects the economy, housing market, and debt holders. The event explored the findings of NAR’s September report, The Impact of Student Loan Debt, which uncovered that student loan debt is one of the most significant hurdles for potential buyers and their ability to purchase a home.</p>
<p>“Today’s millennials are drowning in student loan debt. After our research, we can now say with certainty that student loan debt is making it difficult to buy a home,” said NAR Vice President of Policy Advocacy Bryan Greene to open the event. “We know that homeownership is the ticket to wealth and equity. Many are concerned that to address student loan debt, we would have to take the load off students and put it on taxpayers. Others advocate help from private employers. We need to talk about all options and explore what reforms are possible.”</p>
<p>Fifty one percent of student loan holders say their debt delayed them from purchasing a home. NAR’s Vice President of Demographics and Behavioral Insights, Jessica Lautz, took the time to explore and explain the research the association has recently done.</p>
<p>“We first started researching this topic because of NAR member’s children—they couldn’t afford a home because of the burden of student loan debt. We knew they weren’t alone because there are 40 million Americans holding student loan debt,” said Lautz. “Half of non-owners say student loan debt is delaying them from buying a home. We asked participants in our research to pretend they paid off their student loan debt—they said the first thing they would invest in is long-term savings and the second would be buying a home. So, we know they want to get into homeownership, but they are having a hard time getting there.”</p>
<p>The Mortgage Bankers Association spoke about today’s competitive housing market. Detailing that in the current market candidates are faced with other buyers offering all-cash offers and a competitive bidding process. As a result of intense competition, MBA supports assistance in down payment which is clearly needed for first time homebuyers specially in low-income areas. Senior Vice President of Public Policy for the National Fair Housing Alliance Nikitra Bailey went on to outline how student loan debt has a disproportionate effect on people of color. NAR’s research shows White student debt holders (30%) are less likely than Black (47%) or Hispanic (47%) debt holders to say they are currently incurring student loan debt for themselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_38451" style="width: 319px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38451" class="wp-image-38451" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-the-impact-of-student-loan-debt-report-executive-summary-09-14-2021-page-0-791x1024.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-38451" class="wp-caption-text">The National Association of Realtors released its report “The Impact of Student Loan Debt” last month.</p></div>
<p>“Today Black homeownership is as low as it was when discrimination was legal,” said Bailey. “After 20 years of taking out student loans, Blacks still owe 95% of the balance of the debt and are more likely to default. Post-secondary education is now a necessity to succeed, yet a degree is not a shield from racial disparity. Our proposed Down Payment Targeted Assistance Program addresses student loan debt as a burden that leads to the lack of ability to save for a down payment, mostly among Blacks and Latinos. And our Keys Unlock Dreams Initiative will help close the racial wealth and homeownership gap.”</p>
<p>Rachel Fishman, Deputy Director for Research, Higher Education at New America detailed the burden on parents who take out Parent PLUS loans. These federal loans continue to be an in between space where parents take on the student loan debt of their child.</p>
<p>“When we talk about student loan debt we talk about the student, but we need to start correlating the family,” said Fishman. “My hope is to raise awareness about this issue… to start addressing the root cause of debt—food insecurity, housing affordability, childcare. Families are juggling these things on balance sheets along with student loan debt. Among other recommendations, we seriously need to address college affordability for a four-year degree.”</p>
<p>The last speaker for the event was Ben Kaufman, Head of Investigations &amp; Senior Policy Advisor at the Student Borrower Protection Center. He closed the forum with statistical intel that outlined the chronological timeline showing the increasing financial instability that student loan debt is creating in this country and how it is standing in the way of people being able to purchase a home.</p>
<p>“Student loan debt has exploded in the US. There are more people borrowing, and they are borrowing more. People think of a student loan debt holder as young person, but actually two-thirds of borrowers are over the age of 30,” said Kaufman. “Even before COVID, the rate of delinquency on student loans was higher than the delinquency on mortgages at the peak of the financial crisis. Before COVID, a borrower was defaulting on a student loan every 26 seconds. So much of this is policy choices, for generations every single day in Washington all levels of government have been making decisions on this. It is imperative to claim your seat at the table so your voices can be heard. If your voices were heard from the onset, I don’t think we would see the consequences we see today.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[While this is good news for downstate casino advocates, the RFI issued by the Gaming Commission on Oct. 20 states, “Respondents to this RFI should not anticipate award of a contract; this is an information gathering process only. This RFI is for planning purposes only and should not be interpreted]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—While there is still a long way to go before any official award, the New York State Gaming Commission has issued a Request for Information from interested parties for either developing or operating three downstate New York casinos in the New York metro region.</p>
<p>While this is good news for downstate casino advocates, the RFI issued by the Gaming Commission on Oct. 20 states, “Respondents to this RFI should not anticipate award of a contract; this is an information gathering process only. This RFI is for planning purposes only and should not be interpreted as a solicitation for bids on the part of the State or the Commission.” Four upstate casino licenses have already been awarded by New York State, including the Resorts World Catskills Casino in Monticello, which is owned and operated by Genting.</p>
<p>The issuance of the RFI follows the release of a report detailing the impacts of downstate casino gaming and mobile sports betting by Spectrum Gaming Group released in January 2021 that found downstate counties show the greatest potential for growth in Gross Gaming Revenue, ranging from $970 million to $4.49 billion for New York City, and $606 million to $1.13 billion for Long Island. The potential of the New York City market could be captured by the addition of new gaming facilities, the report stated.</p>
<p>The Gaming Commission has set a deadline for the submission of questions concerning the RFI for Nov. 10, 2021 and for a submission to the RFI by Dec. 10, 2021. The New York State Gaming Commission per state statute has to prepare and distribute a report on the RFI to the governor and the State Legislature no later than six months from the Dec. 10, 2021 deadline. The statute was passed by the State Legislature and signed by then Gov. Andrew Cuomo in April 2021.</p>
<p>If the process does move forward, it could be assumed that a Request for Proposals could be issued in mid-2022 and an award sometime thereafter. It should be noted that the state’s gaming law bans the award of downstate casino licenses until 2023. The measure was intended to allow the upstate casinos to establish a client base before they faced competition from downstate facilities.</p>
<p>The three casino licenses would be awarded to applicants in Zone 1, which consists of New York City and the counties of Nassau, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester. Based on the submittals, the Gaming Commission is seeking to determine the appropriate size and scope of development, the value of the gaming facility license and the process that should be used in the award consideration.</p>
<p>Frontrunners for the downstate licenses, should the process move forward include two existing gaming facilities—the Genting-operated Resorts World New York City at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, as well as the MGM Resorts-owned Empire City Casino in Yonkers. Both facilities are Video Lottery Terminal gaming facilities and are not full-fledged casinos. Genting is also moving forward on another VLT facility in the City of Newburgh in approximately 90,000 square feet of space at the Newburgh Mall.</p>
<p><em>The New York Post</em> has reported that Bally’s Corp., Wynn Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands are all expected to compete for a New York City-area casino license.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his State of the State address in January reported that he intended to issue a Request for Information for interested parties in securing up to three of the remaining casino gaming licenses in Downstate New York (New York City metro region) to be granted by New York State. However, the State Gaming Commission at the time had no comment on the governor’s statement.</p>
<p>A group of 60 business and labor organizations called “A Sure Bet for New York’s Future” lobbied state lawmakers earlier this year to have the downstate gaming award process move forward and award one of the casino licenses to the Empire City Casino in Yonkers.</p>
<p>The granting of a full gaming license to Empire City could fuel significant economic growth and jobs to the region. A spokesperson for Empire City Casino told<em> Real Estate In-Depth</em> earlier this year that if awarded a full gaming license and sports betting access, Empire City Casino owner MGM Resorts has committed to spend approximately $400 million in the first phase of its planned investment at the Yonkers property.</p>
<p>John Ravitz, executive vice president and chief operating officer of The Business Council of Westchester, said that allowing Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts to achieve its potential as a full-scale casino will continue to be The Business Council of Westchester’s top legislative priority. Ravitz, who is the Co-Chair of “Sure Bet for New York’s Future” Alliance, said that if Empire City secures the full gaming license it will lead to the creation of more than 10,000 direct and indirect hires; $1 billion in economic activity and $424 million in private investment.</p>
<p>“We hope that yesterday’s announcement by the state’s Gaming Commission will now give us an a transparent and expedited process to achieving the full-gaming license from Empire City Casino in 2022,” he said. “There should no longer be any delays put up to get this done. We already have the bricks and mortar in place. Let’s get this done now so New York can benefit from this huge economic development project.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—It may seem like a broken record, but once again home sales in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors market area continued to be strong in the third quarter, with most counties posting impressive sales gains over last year. Analysts indicate that both nationally and locally, that tune will likely be playing well into 2022.</p>
<p>Overall home sales were up sharply in all but one county in the HGAR region. The Bronx posted a remarkable 84.5% increase in sales in the third quarter as compared to last year, while Westchester notched a 22.1% gain in sales volume, followed by Rockland County at 13.7%, Putnam at 7.4% and Orange at a very respectable 5.2% sales increase. The outlier was Sullivan County, which suffered a 23.4% decrease in sales from last year’s third quarter when it benefitted from a large influx of New York City buyers who were looking to relocate out of the city during the height of the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>A deeper dive into the numbers released recently in the “<strong><a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HGAR-OneKey-MLS-2021-3rd-Quarter-Report-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneKey MLS’s “2021 Third Quarter Residential Real Estate Sales Report— Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx Counties, New York</a></strong>” shows that the single-family home sales market posted strong gains. Westchester County saw a 9.0% increase in single-family home sales in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 and a 5.6% increase in the median-sale price to $855,000. Putnam County enjoyed a 3.4% rise in sales and a 13.3% increase in the single-family median home price to $466,500. Rockland County’s single-family sector posted a 5.6% increase in sales in the third quarter and a 13.5% rise in the median-home price to $579,000.</p>
<p>Orange County’s single-family home market saw sales fall 1.3%, but the median home price rose 16.7% as compared to last year to close out the third quarter of 2021 at $385,000. Since the third quarter of 2018, the median home price for a single-family home in Orange County has risen by $110,000. Sullivan County suffered a 24% decrease in single-family home sales in the third quarter of this year, but registered a 25.8% increase in its median single-family home price to $250,250. The Bronx saw single-family home sales rise 42.9% in the third quarter of 2021 and its median home price increase by 13.8% to $597,500.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-38543" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HGAR-Market-Area-Home-Sales-Q3-2021-slider.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" />The condominium and cooperative markets in Westchester saw strong sales gains and double-digit percentage increases in their respective median sale prices. Condominium sales in Westchester rose 44.4%, while cooperative deals spiked by 67.4% in the third quarter as compared to the same period 12 months earlier. The median condominium price at the end of the third quarter of this year in Westchester was $470,000, an 11.2% increase from last year, while the median price for a cooperative unit rose 11.1% to $200,000.</p>
<p>Nationally, the National Association of Realtors and other trade groups point to a continued bullish home sales market for the remainder of this year and into 2022 while all warn of the continued low level of for-sale inventory across the nation.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae in its recently released Economic &amp; Housing Outlook revised downward its Gross Domestic Product projections for 2021 and 2022 due to supply constraints and rising inflation, but revised upward its forecasts for the housing market.</p>
<p>“As measured by the FHFA Purchase-Only Index, we now expect 2021 annual house price appreciation to be 16.6%, up from 14.8%, while our forecast of 2022 home price growth was upgraded by 2.3 percentage points to 7.4%. Revisions to the 2022 home sales forecast were modest; however, leading indicators point to near-term existing home sales surprising to the upside. We have therefore revised upward our expectations for 2021 total home sales growth to 4.7% from 3.3%,” the Fannie Mae report stated.</p>
<p>HGAR President Crystal Hawkins-Syska told the <em>Journal News</em> that she expects the sales market in the Hudson Valley to be “robust” despite the low levels of for-sale inventory.</p>
<p>She added that the market remains very competitive. “For buyers, it&#8217;s still very competitive—down payments make a difference, so buyers who have a lower down payment, they have to be patient,&#8221; Hawkins-Syska said. They will be competing at times with people prepared to put more money down.</p>
<p>Gail Fattizzi, Regional Manager for ERA Insite Realty, said that the third quarter sales market, while still strong, was not as frenzied as the 2021 spring market. She added that may have something to do with the New York City residential market, noting that apartment sales in Manhattan hit the highest point in the last 30 years in the third quarter. “After a pandemic lockdown and watching many residents head for the suburbs and beyond, the city is coming back in true New York fashion, a trend that seems certain to continue,” she said.</p>
<p>Former HGAR President Fattizzi, while noting that low inventory continues to be a drag on the market, addressed another potential problem going forward. “There are still some forecasts alluding to properties in pandemic-induced forbearance becoming foreclosures. There currently is no data to support that happening,” she said. “The strong majority of forbearances are back on track. With home appreciation over the past several years, most homeowners have enough equity in their homes that they can easily sell if they need to, and even short sales are unlikely. So, there may be some inventory generated down the road, but not at distressed prices.”</p>
<p>Liz Nunan, president and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence, also addressed New York City’s impact on the suburban markets. “While New York City is offering attractive pricing and experiencing increased buyer activity, helping to fuel its recovery, many buyers desire more square footage, outdoor space, and the respite that our counties offer. It is yet to be determined what percentage of the workforce will continue to work from home, be it full-time or part-time, but the ability to do so comfortably remains top of mind for today’s buyers.”</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer for Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, said the suburban NYC regional residential market entered a “new normal” in the third quarter with all-time highs in sales and prices.</p>
<p>“But, we saw signs of the market stabilizing after a torrid year, with listings and pending deals falling from the highs reached last summer,” he noted.</p>
<p>While activity may be down from the feverish pace of the early days of the pandemic in 2020, Rand does not see any evidence of a correction on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Yes, pendings and listings are down compared to the third quarter of 2020, but remember that the third quarter of 2020 was one of the strongest quarters in the history of this market, right in the middle of that tidal wave. That’s not a fair comparison—the market was never going to stay on the Post-Lockdown pace,” Rand said.</p>
<p>Rand in the firm’s recent released report listed seven takeaways from the third quarter market. 1) Sales surged again, hitting all-time highs; 2) Prices continue to appreciate dramatically, reaching all-time highs; 3) Pending sales are down from last year’s pace, but were still strong; 4) Listings were down again, with inventory reaching all-time lows; 5) Homes are now consistently selling for higher than the asking price; 6) Homes are selling more quickly than ever before and 7) Even with prices rising, low rates are keeping monthly payments near historic lows.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[One industry expert predicts that Tarrytown-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will lead the growth of the bioscience and healthcare sectors in the county in the years to come, similar to the way IBM dominated the technology sector in Westchester beginning about 50 years ago.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A panel of experts charged with identifying the industries that will reimagine Westchesteridentified a host of emerging sectors, including e-commerce, cannabis legalization, adaptive reuse, as well as the biosciences and health care as the catalysts for economic growth in the coming years in Westchester County.</p>
<p>One industry expert predicts that Tarrytown-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will lead the growth of the bioscience and healthcare sectors in the county in the years to come, similar to the way IBM dominated the technology sector in Westchester beginning about 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The virtual program hosted by The Fordham Real Estate Institute and The Business Council of Westchester on Sept. 17, was moderated by Dr. Marsha Gordon, president and CEO of The Business Council of Westchester.</p>
<p>The panel featured Matthew Claster, Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development, Clarapath, Hawthorne; Bridget Gibbons, Director of Economic Development, Westchester County; Guy Leibler, President, Simone Healthcare Development, Simone Development Companies, Bronx; Connie Levene, President, CONRI Services, Hawthorne; Serge Reda, Chair, Real Estate Development Curriculum Committee and Adjunct Professor, Fordham Real Estate Institute, New York City; Justin Singer, Partner, Feuerstein Kulick LLP, New York City and Andrew S. Weisz, Executive Vice President, RPW Group Inc., Rye Brook.</p>
<p>Simone Healthcare’s Leibler, discussed how the health care sector will continue to evolve over the next decade. “Dealing with COVID-19 has made everyone smarter,” Leibler said. “Health care and life sciences will merge, and research from the bench needs to get to the bedside. Health care will remain a very important component of our economy in Westchester. We need to support that, bring in labor—we’ve seen a tremendous amount of nursing and physician burnout. That needs to be recognized and rebuilt.”</p>
<p>When asked by moderator Gordon what impact fast growing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will have on the county and whether the Tarrytown-based firm will have a similar impact as IBM had on the county decades earlier, Leibler responded, “There is every reason to believe that Regeneron will act as the beacon, the 800-pound gorilla, that IBM served in Westchester in the 1960s and 1970s. I think we will see talent and leadership being brought into Regeneron and then we will see that talent spun-out of Regeneron.”</p>
<p>He added that growth in the biosciences and health care sectors will come in two different pieces—the first being spinoffs from Regeneron that will grow their operations in Westchester. The second piece will be Regeneron serving as “the instigator” for other similar biotech and pharmaceutical firms to locate in the county in order to collaborate with Regeneron and other firms in that cluster.</p>
<p>Gibbons noted the resiliency of Westchester’s business community and cited some of the innovative programs the county launched during the pandemic, including a $14-million grant to help companies recover. The county has thus far awarded nearly 300 companies grants of up to $42,000 each. A recent county study of the program found that the grants resulted in a total of $18 million in economic impact, including $7 million in earnings preserved and $11 million of in-county spending.</p>
<p>“Our Westchester businesses are so smart. It’s amazing how they have pivoted, adapted, used grant money and found other ways to keep their businesses going,” Gibbons said and pointed to a Department of Labor report showing the metro area, which includes Westchester, Rockland and Orange counties, had the third-highest growth rate in the state, at 6.1%, comparing August 2021 with August 2020. The hospitality sector, which was battered by COVID-19, is seeing a resurgence and posted a 28.3% growth rate in August 2021 as compared to 12 months earlier.</p>
<p>Gibbons also pointed to the county’s “Launch 1000” initiative, which provides Westchester residents the tools to start their own business. To date more than 600 residents have participated in the program and recently approximately 50 people graduated from the program and the firms they have launched are already generating revenue, she noted.</p>
<p>Clarapath, a medical robotics company in Hawthorne, recently expanded into Westchester. Claster cited aspects needed to support and encourage more innovation. “It comes down to incentives,” Claster said. “The county has done a fabulous job with incentives—opportunities for grants, recruitment support. A lot of people want these types of tenants—the sector is hot—but landlords need to be prepared because we’re not traditional tenants. We require specialized space, power, ‘clean’ rooms – it’s a big endeavor. If landlords want to attract the companies, they’ve got to put in the investment.”</p>
<p>Fordham Professor Reda, who also works in the development division of Cedar Realty Trust, a publicly traded REIT, discussed retail and industrial real estate. “The rise of e-commerce, combined with COVID, has altered the retail and industrial real estate dynamic dramatically,” Reda said, explaining how retailers have been moving to an omni-channeling strategy that pairs an online purchase with an in-store experience. “Industrial real estate has been functioning a little more like retail real estate, and COVID is accelerating the retail and industrial sectors blurring together. This trend will require an adjustment to many current zoning regulations.”</p>
<p>Levene said Westchester County is well-positioned for companies like CONRI Services, which shifted its initial business model from printing to warehousing and distribution. “One of the great strengths of Westchester is its labor pool,” Levene said. “Westchester has a highly qualified skilled and hourly labor pool, which I attribute to the quality of the educational systems. That competency has allowed us to grow significantly and add to the complexity our systems and the way we manage our business.”</p>
<p>Another emerging sector in Westchester is cannabis and Feuerstein Kulick’s Singer noted opportunities for growth. “All eyes are on New York right now,” said Singer, referring to the recent passage of the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act that legalized recreational cannabis in New York. “This is poised to be a huge, multibillion-dollar market and there’s a ton of opportunity within Westchester and a ton of interest from clients across the country who want to bring their brand and their operations to this area.”</p>
<p>In terms of Westchester’s office market, RPW Group’s Weisz noted county government and local municipalities are “embracing more diversified uses.”</p>
<p>“We’ve seen Wegman’s open, Life Time (athletic resort) open, we see the growth of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and, lately, residential development,” said Weisz. “As importantly, we’ve seen a great influx of new families, young families, and a lot of these folks are looking to work closer to home. That’s who companies are looking to hire—to retain and hire good talent, and also get employees back in the office. We’re bullish about Westchester and where we’re headed.”</p>
<p>The Presenting Sponsor for “Reimagining Westchester: E-commerce, Distribution, Cannabis, Health, Biotech, Real Estate and Infrastructure to Support Future Growth” was Wells Fargo. Contributing sponsors included the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Westchester County, Rand Commercial, RM Friedland and Simone Development Companies.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[While not unexpected, the state DEC has denied a key air quality permit for the $500-million Danskammer Energy Center project in Newburgh]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY —The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation announced today (Oct. 27) that it had denied key air permits for the $500-million Danskammer Energy Center project in Newburgh and the Astoria Gas Turbine Power project in Queens.</p>
<p>The two projects were widely supported by business and labor sectors, but were opposed by environmental groups and some politicians. After receiving more than 4,500 public comments on the project, the DEC denied the required Title V air permit for the Danskammer Energy Center in the Town of Newburgh in Orange County.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “Our review determined the proposed project does not demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. The proposed project would be inconsistent with or would interfere with the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits established in the Climate Act. Danskammer failed to demonstrate the need or justification for the proposed project notwithstanding this inconsistency.”</p>
<p>In the department’s 14-page decision, Daniel Whitehead, director, division of environmental permits for the DEC, stated that Danskammer has the right to request an administrative adjudicatory hearing regarding the denial of its Title V Application. If Danskammer wishes for such a hearing to be held, it must submit a request in writing within 30 days.</p>
<p>The Danskammer Energy project, which had been valued at $500 million, was in the Article 10 process before the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment. Earlier this year it received a major endorsement from the New York State AFL-CIO. The proposed project would convert the aging Danskammer plant into a 535-megawatt energy facility. The project cannot move forward without the Title V air permit.</p>
<p>The project was opposed by many politicians and environmental groups. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said of the DEC denials of the Danskammer and Astoria Gas Turbine projects, “I applaud the Department of Environmental Conservation&#8217;s decisions to deny the Title V permits for the Danskammer Energy Center and Astoria Gas Turbine Power, LLC in the context of our state&#8217;s clean energy transition. Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time, and we owe it to future generations to meet our nation-leading climate and emissions reduction goals.”</p>
<p>Scenic Hudson President Ned Sullivan said specifically of the DEC’s Danskammer permit denial: “The denial of an air permit for the proposed Danskammer fossil fuel plant shows loud and clear that Gov. Kathy Hochul and DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos are champions in efforts to confront the climate crisis and environmental injustice—the cornerstones of New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Scenic Hudson is grateful to both, and while we hope this step will end plans to construct such a needless and harmful facility, we will continue doing all we can to ensure it never gets built.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to see the DEC made this decision,” said Dan Shapley, Interim Riverkeeper and Vice President of Programs at Riverkeeper in a report in the <em>Albany Times Union</em>. “We’re glad to see the state is standing firm in the face of the reality that we need to reduce emissions, not increase them. This is a really important decision and a great day for our future.”</p>
<p>Representatives of Danskammer Energy could not be reached for comment at press time.</p>
<p>The Astoria Gas Turbine project is being proposed by a subsidiary of NRG Energy. The project is expected to replace 50-year old power generators in 2023 with state-of-the-art technology reducing the total generating capability of the site and lowering on-site peak air emission rates by up to 99% per hour. A recent study showed the project would create 510 jobs per year during construction, 73 jobs per year during operations, and contribute more than $325 million into New York’s economy through 2040. Like the Danskammer project, the Astoria Gas Turbine project cannot move forward without the state Title V air permit.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The framework also features hard-fought NAR-backed priorities like investments in down-payment assistance and also spares real estate investment from the most feared taxes.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors has released an analysis of the framework released by the Biden administration yesterday of his now $1.75-billion “Build Back Better” plan that includes historic investment in affordable housing. The framework also features hard-fought NAR-backed priorities like investments in down-payment assistance and also spares real estate investment from the most feared taxes.</p>
<p>President Biden announced the proposal at the White House after a morning meeting at the Capitol on Thursday. At present, the framework does not mention an increase or the elimination of the SALT Cap. NAR officials state that an amendment to the bill can be introduced once debate on the measure begins. NAR officials stated that it plans to continue to fight for a solution to the issue.</p>
<p>“NAR’s advocacy operation is built for crossroads moments like this one. For the past year, we have educated lawmakers on the effects of misguided and harmful taxes on real estate and the need for affordable housing investment,” says Shannon McGahn, chief advocacy officer at NAR.</p>
<p>The framework agreement is also the key to unlocking a vote in the House on a $1.2-trillion bipartisan “hard” infrastructure bill, which has already passed the Senate. Progressives want a deal on the social spending plan before voting on the bipartisan bill that funds traditional infrastructure championed by NAR like roads, bridges, broadband and the power grid.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled she may bring the bipartisan infrastructure bill to a vote as soon as today.</p>
<p>“Support for this framework and the bipartisan bill’s passage is far from certain, but this announcement shows increased momentum for the effort to get the bill to the president’s desk,” NAR’s McGahn said.</p>
<p><strong>Historic Investment in Affordable Housing</strong></p>
<p>The framework includes a $150-billion investment in affordable housing, a key NAR priority and focus of its advocacy efforts for the past year.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, public housing and rental assistance would get funding boosts. The plan would also create more than one million new affordable rental and single-family homes and invest in down-payment assistance.</p>
<p>The White House says the down-payment assistance under the plan would allow “hundreds of thousands of first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home and build wealth.”</p>
<p>As negotiations continued in recent weeks, media reports suggested that housing provisions might be cut from the bill altogether.</p>
<p>In response, last week, NAR CEO Bob Goldberg joined other housing leaders and key members of Congress near the Senate steps for a press conference calling for the inclusion of affordable housing provisions in the final bill.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we have to find ways to close the supply shortfall,” Goldberg said at the press conference. “Doing so will be particularly meaningful for lower-income households, millennials, and households of color.”</p>
<p>“We continued to press both publicly and privately for these provisions,” McGahn said. “Affordable housing is the key to unlocking prosperity for millions of Americans currently excluded from the American Dream. This investment is critical for closing the racial homeownership gap and addressing income disparity. It opens up homeownership for first-generation and first-time buyers.”</p>
<p>The framework agreement includes funding for the following programs within the housing section:</p>
<p>• Public housing</p>
<p>• Housing Trust Fund</p>
<p>• HOME</p>
<p>• Down-payment assistance</p>
<p>• Housing vouchers</p>
<p>• Minority Business Development Agency</p>
<p><strong>Tax Provisions Spare Real Estate Investments</strong></p>
<p>The plan is paid for with new taxes on high-income individuals and businesses, but the most feared taxes on real estate investment were excluded.</p>
<p>“Some of the earlier tax proposals floated would have devastated the real estate sector, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the entire economy,” McGahn said. “This framework has no 1031 like-kind exchange limits, no capital gains tax increases, no change in step-up in basis, no tax on unrealized capital gains, no increased estate tax, no carried-interest provisions, and no 199A limits. The tax provision of this framework is very positive for consumers, property owners, and the real estate economy.”</p>
<p>“We worked for more than a year to educate lawmakers on these issues and launched a targeted Call For Action on taxes. The tax provision of this framework is testament to the effectiveness of our education campaign in Washington,” McGahn continued.</p>
<p>The plan does not mention State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction relief. However, congressional leaders still support an increase in the SALT cap, and a group of bipartisan House members is still demanding a solution.</p>
<p>“Congressional leadership can address SALT through an amendment once a bill is under formal debate,” McGahn said. “We won’t let down our guard on SALT and are still hopeful for a solution.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TARRYTOWN—At its 105th Annual Member Appreciation Day, held on Oct. 25 at the Sleepy Hollow Hotel &amp; Conference Center in Tarrytown, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors awarded Ron Garafalo, sales manager with John J. Lease Realtors in Middletown, as its “Realtor of the Year” for 2021.</p>
<p>David Singer, CEO of Robison Oil in Port Chester, was named the 2021 HGAR “Affiliate Member of the Year.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>PEARL RIVER—Industrial Realty Group (IRG), the owner of the former Pfizer complex in Pearl River, has rebranded the property as the “Hudson Valley iCampus” and has hired commercial real estate veteran Jamie Schwartz to head the marketing effort to lease and develop new space on the campus.</p>
<p>Schwartz, who had spent the past 18 years as executive vice president of GHP Office Realty, LLC in White Plains, has been named president of the Hudson Valley iCampus, a two-million-square-foot mixed-use, multi-tenanted campus on 207 acres. The campus was sold by Pfizer, Inc. in 2015 to Industrial Realty Group, LLC, a Los Angeles-based real estate development and investment firm that owns more than 100 million square feet of commercial property across the U.S. The site is managed by its affiliate, IRG Realty Advisors, LLC, which is headquartered in Richfield, OH.</p>
<div id="attachment_38697" style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38697" class="wp-image-38697" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/J.Schwartz-3.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-38697" class="wp-caption-text">Jamie Schwartz, president, Hudson Valley iCampus</p></div>
<p>Schwartz’s appointment was the result of an extensive executive search for the leadership role at the campus, IRG Realty Group states. He has already begun a major rebranding effort, renaming the property “Hudson Valley iCampus.” It was previously the New York Center for Innovation. Schwartz also is responsible for reintroducing the property to current and prospective tenants and to brokers, as well as building and leading a strong management and operations team. Additionally, Schwartz will be planning and executing a development strategy for the vast amount of buildable land at the site.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled Jamie decided to continue his very successful career at our Hudson Valley iCampus,” said Stuart Lichter, president and chairman of IRG. “His experience, accomplishments and reputation in the marketplace as well as his relationships in the community have already had a positive impact.”</p>
<p>Schwartz said that there is currently approximately 1.5 million square feet of space available for lease at Hudson Valley iCampus. He noted that his firm is looking at potentially developing or joint venturing on approximately 30 acres of available land at the moment. Those parcels could accommodate up to two, 180,000-square-foot buildings. At present, those parcels are zoned for Light Industrial, Laboratory-Office or Light-Industrial-Office use.</p>
<p>At GHP Office Realty, Schwartz was responsible for the leasing, management and construction of GHP’s multimillion-square-foot office, flex, warehouse and retail portfolio. Schwartz also managed GHP’s third-party broker representation and was an integral part of the acquisitions, sales and debt-placement teams. Throughout his career, he has negotiated and closed new lease, renewal, acquisition and sales deals worth more than $1.5 billion comprising approximately eight million square feet. Schwartz also is an experienced attorney specializing in commercial real estate transactions, litigation and entertainment law.</p>
<p>“Although I was not looking to make a career move, when I was approached for this position it presented a unique opportunity for me to combine all of my professional experience with the forward-thinking leadership that is the hallmark of IRG,” said Schwartz. “I’m looking forward to collaborating with all of the stakeholders to successfully lead an exciting new chapter for the property.”</p>
<p>Hudson Valley iCampus tenants include Pfizer, Inc.; RK Pharma, Inc.; Sanofi US Services, Inc.; Iris Biogen Corp.; and Urban Electric Power, Inc. The property also features a 23-megawatt Central Utility Plant that provides electricity, steam and chilled water to the tenants and also to the buildings Pfizer’s owns. Schwartz said that the power plant is a huge benefit since tenant’s utility costs are lower as compared to if they purchased the power from the public utility.</p>
<p>The campus has previously served as Lederle Laboratories’ R&amp;D, laboratory, manufacturing and headquarters, dating to the early 1900s. The property was later transferred to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Pfizer acquired Wyeth and the original 240-acre property in 2009 and sold 207 acres and 25 buildings to IRG in 2015. Pfizer currently occupies approximately 850,000 square feet on 33 contiguous acres it owns.</p>

<p><em>(Editor’s Note: Part one of a two-part series)</em></p>
<p>The holidays are quickly approaching and with it, the anticipation of holiday cheer, kindness, courtesy, and giving. While this is wonderful, as Realtors we should be embracing this attitude all year long. Sadly, whether due to the market, the business, political unrest, or some other factors, the real estate business has become rife with issues that stem primarily from the lack of kindness, cooperation and professionalism. This duty starts with the Code of Ethics Preamble and continues with numerous articles. It even extends into the OneKey Rules and Procedures. Whether you realize it or not, being a Realtor is a privilege and an honor.</p>
<p>Not every real estate professional is a Realtor. In joining an association, you agree to hold yourself to a higher standard of honor, expertise, and professionalism. Failing to comply with the Realtors’ tenets and Code of Ethics creates a bad image for the industry, your brokerage and you. It may even result with fines, Professional Standards hearings, with possible discipline or suspension and even lawsuits.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken about many of these issues in the past, however, in light with what has been reported by many as a downturn in professionalism and human courtesies, I think it timely to discuss it again and point out that all Realtors are responsible for not only promoting these principles, but also rooting out and reporting the violation of these principles. It is time to “Stand Up and Deliver.”</p>
<p><strong>The Preamble</strong></p>
<p>Most Realtors recall from their earliest days in the profession that the Code of Ethics Preamble contains the “Golden Rule” (do unto others and you would have them do unto you). But the Code of Ethics goes beyond that. It states in the Preamble that because of the founding principles and importance of owning real estate, these interests create “obligations beyond those of ordinary commerce.” As such, these interests “…impose grave social responsibility and a patriotic duty to which Realtors should dedicate themselves…. Realtors, therefore, are zealous to maintain and improve the standards of their calling and share with their fellow Realtors a common responsibility for its integrity and honor.”</p>
<p>Additionally, they are to “…eliminate practices which may damage the public or which might discredit or bring dishonor to the real estate profession.” Because of the need to promote the best interests of their clients and the public, Realtors realize that cooperation with other real estate professionals is in the best interest of those that utilize their services; therefore, Realtors should “not attempt to gain any unfair advantage over their competitor; and they refrain from making unsolicited comments about other practitioners.” If their opinion is offered, it should be done in an “objective professional manner, uninfluenced by any personal motivation or potential advantage or gain.”</p>
<p>Not only does the Code establish a standard of professional conduct, it also establishes a duty to act and identify those Realtors that violate the Code regarding matters relating to the public trust by stating that “Realtors having direct personal knowledge of conduct that may violate the Code of Ethics…bring such matters to the attention of the appropriate Board or Association of Realtors.”</p>

<p>These ideals set Realtors apart from other licensees. It raises the bar far above what is expected from the standard real estate professional. Realtors should be proud to identify themselves and their title in this profession. These requirements embrace competency, fairness, and high integrity. I know of no other profession, other than perhaps doctors and lawyers, that establishes such a lofty ideal of moral conduct in business relations with the sole intent of preserving honesty, courtesy and professionalism. Today, more than any other time, we need to Stand Up and Deliver.</p>

<div class="siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget">
<p><strong>Article 1: Client Best Interests and Honesty to Parties</strong></p>
<p>Article 1 sets the stage. “Realtors pledge themselves to protect and promote the interests of their clients.” Simply put, the clients’ interests come first. Making a commission is secondary. Our duty is to help our clients as best we can, even at our own detriment. Article 1 also says that Realtors must also “treat all parties honestly.” This simple requirement goes to keeping a level playing field based on honesty and integrity. Without it, our profession is denigrated, and transactions become difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p>So, what does that mean in practice? While Article 1 can be interpreted to encompass many things, the Standards of Practice (SOP) illuminate common issues that come up. It means:</p>
<p>• You CANNOT LIE on market value to obtain a listing by underpricing or overpricing (SOP 1-3)</p>
<p>• You MUST disclose and obtain approval before you can be a dual agent (SOP 1-5)</p>
<p>• You MUST present all offers/counteroffers objectively and as quickly as possible (SOP 1-6, 1-7, 1-8)</p>
<p>• You cannot share confidential information of your client (SOP1-9)</p>
<p>• Regarding showings, you CANNOT access or use the property in any fashion other than on the terms or conditions authorized by the owner, or permit others to do the same (SOP 1-16)</p>
<p>Concerning the use of the property under SOP 1-16, it’s important to understand that this is a listing broker requirement. It means that a Realtor cannot impose additional requirements that the homeowner/landlord has not required in order for a cooperating agent to show the property. Things such as COVID forms, pre-approvals, W-2 production, credit check, or other information or forms cannot be required in order to show the property unless the client has authorized them. Conversely, if there are showing requirements, they must be complied with by everyone and not ignored.</p>
<p>Failing to comply with Article 1 can potentially bring a Code of Ethics complaint which can subject the offending party to discipline including letters of warning, required remedial classes, a fine up to $15,000 and even membership suspension, not to mention the valuable time and interruption to your business activities. Realtors need to make the effort to identify those that fall short of their duties and obligations. Not just the Realtor who was affected…All Realtors need to be vigilant. The process cannot work without everyone being involved. Realtors can’t be too busy to bother or simply put the onus on someone else. Their client’s interests are at stake. Realtors need to support the Code and Stand Up and Deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Showing Requirements: OneKey Rules and Procedures</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above, a listing agent cannot impose additional requirements on a cooperating agent that have not been established by the homeowner/landlord. Further, the OneKey Rules and Procedures establishes showing requirements that all Realtor Participants must comply with. They are:</p>
<p>• Listing agents MUST provide reasonable access to all listings. Failing to provide access could be an Article 1 violation, as it may not be in the best interests of the client.</p>
<p>• ALL listings must be available to be shown within 24 hours of the effective date of the listing (unless there are instructions from the owner).</p>
<p>• Showing requests MUST be responded to “immediately,” which means within three hours of receipt.</p>
<p>• If there are any restrictions regarding showings, they MUST be in writing (and presented upon request).</p>
<p>Selectively showing a property based upon a Realtor’s personal desires, motivations, or financial gain is a violation of the rule. This rule requires that all Realtors be treated in the same fashion regarding showings and, above all, that all showings are scheduled and allowed in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Failing to timely show a property may result in an Article 1 violation (not acting in the best interests of your client). It may also result in the assessment of fines by a Facilitator as well as a possible Article 3 violation. But if fines are to be assessed or a Code of Ethics violation is to be brought, it must be initiated by a Realtor; someone who has integrity and honor and will not permit bad actors to continue to disrupt honest business. That Realtor must Stand Up and Deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Rules Enforcement Facilitators</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest offenses being identified in our area are that agents are not communicating or cooperating regarding setting up showings or in presenting offers. What may not be realized is that, aside from filing a complaint pursuant to the Code of Ethics, a broker may engage the services of a Rules Enforcement Facilitator if there isn’t timely cooperation (we’re talking a few hours) regarding these issues and Facilitators are authorized to apply fines, starting at $500, for the lack of timely communication and compliance.</p>
<p>Facilitators are appointed by OneKey MLS to resolve broker-to-broker disputes regarding showings and presentations. They can resolve the following disputes:</p>
<p>• Cooperating broker/agent is having difficulty making a showing appointment.</p>
<p>• Listing broker/agent is not providing timely production of written showing instruction from owner.</p>
<p>• Listing broker/agent is not making timely arrangements to present an offer.</p>
<p>• Cooperating broker/agent is not making timely arrangements to present counteroffer.</p>
<p>• Listing broker/agent is not providing timely production of owner’s written waiver of offer presentation.</p>
<p>• Cooperating broker/agent is not providing timely production of buyer’s written waiver of offer presentation.</p>
<p>• Listing broker/agent is not providing timely return of offer acknowledgment form or sworn declaration that offer was presented.</p>
<p>In order to engage a Facilitator, the Realtor must first try to resolve the issue themselves. If that fails, then they need to engage the help of their broker/manager to try to resolve the matter. If that fails, then the broker/manager (not the agent) may contact the Facilitator to ask for help.</p>
<p>Once engaged, a Facilitator will attempt to reach the offending broker by phone/text to resolve the matter. If there is no response (usually after an hour or two), then the Facilitator will usually follow up with another call or provide a Facilitator Request Form indicating what is required of the broker. If there is no response within one hour, then the Facilitator can apply an automatic fine ($500- 1st offense; $750- 2nd offense; $1,000- 3+ offenses). If the broker or any of his agents violates a specific rule five or more times within a given 12-month period, then the MLS staff can refer the broker to the MLS Rules Enforcement Committee for a hearing. This committee can apply the same discipline as a Professional Standards Hearing Panel (i.e. up to a $15,000 fine, membership suspension).</p>
<p>Facilitators are available to assist Realtors; however, the Realtor must act swiftly. If there is no immediate response, then the Realtor must go into action and engage their broker/manager as soon as possible. Their client’s best interests are at stake. That broker/manager must also be decisive and engage; first with the broker, and then with the Facilitator if there is no response. Without all the parties working together, the rule is worthless. The objective is to obtain access and communication, not to fine; although the fine is the “teeth” in this situation if there is noncompliance.</p>
<p>The hope is that with enough Realtors working in unison to enforce compliance, the tables will turn, and the days of lackadaisical communication and cooperation will come to an end. Uncooperative brokers will continually incur fines and many may see themselves before a HGAR tribunal requiring them to account for their actions and possibly fining them or suspending their membership. The key is, Realtors need to Stand Up and Deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In today’s challenging environment, it seems OK to do whatever is necessary to get ahead; to make a few more deals, obtain a few more clients, make a few more dollars. Machiavelli said, “The end justifies the means.” But that is not true. What suffers is integrity. What is lost is the reputation and trust from the public. Being a Realtor means something special. It’s an honor, a duty and a responsibility. Cooperation and courtesy are the cornerstones of being a Realtor. Without them, the reputation falls away, the confidence is gone. Realtors owe it to themselves and to the association to which they belong to rise, stand tall, identify wrongs, and require all Realtors to abide by the Code we chose to embrace. It’s time to Stand Up and Deliver.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In connection with every real estate transaction in New York, real estate attorneys and real estate agents discuss with their clients, whether they are sellers or buyers, what the “closing date” will be and how it is to be determined, often utilizing terms such as “on or about closing date,” “reasonable time” and “time of the essence.” Most real estate contracts provide for an “on or about” closing date, which basically means an “estimated” closing date. The key takeaway is that an “on or about” closing date is not set in stone and is subject to reasonable extensions and adjournments depending on issues which may arise.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘On or About’ Closing Date</strong></p>
<p>In an attempt to explain to their clients what is meant by an “on or about” closing date, many agents and attorneys tell clients that this means the parties automatically have a 30-day extension beyond that date to close. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Others fail to explain to clients that an “on or about” date is just an estimated target and should not be relied on to make moving plans, schedule other closings, etc. Often, the parties do not end up closing “on or about” the date contained in the contract and it is imperative that both seller and buyer clients are made aware of this. Buyers and sellers should know that if any issues arise, the closing date could be pushed back by days, weeks or months.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Time of the Essence’ Closing Date</strong></p>
<p>While most transactions and contracts in New York contain an “on or about” closing date, some contracts, although a rarer occurrence, provide for a “time of the essence” closing date. In this instance, a contract does set a specific date, and if either party fails to close by that date it would lead to a default. In the case of a buyer, it could mean the loss of the down payment. For sellers, it could lead to a lawsuit against the seller for specific performance (i.e., an action filed in seeking a judgment requiring the seller to close).</p>
<p>A more common way a “time of the essence” scenario could arise, is where a contract includes an “on or about” closing date and either party fails to close by the projected date. In this instance, the parties’ attorneys may declare “time of the essence,” provided certain legal requirements are met. Again, while many of these terms are commonly used, they are often not well understood. This article will review recent court decisions, as well as existing case law, and provide a general overview of what these terms and principles mean.</p>
<p><strong>The Facts in Xelo v. Hamilton</strong></p>
<p>In a recent Second Department, Appellate Division decision, the Appellate Court in <em>Xelo v. Hamilton</em> (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3HmCEPd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3HmCEPd</a>) reversed the trial court’s decision and awarded the down payment to the seller holding that the purchasers were in breach of the contract and had not closed timely. In November 2006, the purchaser and seller entered into a contract for sale of residential real property for the purchase price of $854,900 and remitted a down payment of $15,000. The down payment was held by the seller’s attorney, acting as escrow agent under the contract, in his attorney escrow account. In the same month, the purchasers timely obtained a mortgage commitment in accordance with the contract of sale. The mortgage commitment was valid until Feb. 25, 2007. The contract provided for a closing that was “on or about 60 days” after the date the contract was executed. However, the seller was unable to vacate the home and no closing had been scheduled before the commitment expired. The court also pointed out that there was an existing violation relating to occupancy of the basement.</p>
<p>After the first commitment had expired, the purchaser then applied for a second smaller mortgage and sought a reduction of the purchase price from the seller, which the seller refused. The purchaser then applied for a third loan and was ultimately denied. The seller offered the purchaser the opportunity to cancel the contract provided the purchaser would agree to allow the seller to retain $3,000 to cover certain expenses incurred by the seller in connection with the transaction. The purchasers did not accept the seller’s offer and “…declared the seller to be in breach of the contract due to her failure to vacate the premises and remove the violation on the property and demanded the return of their down payment.” The seller’s counsel then sent the purchasers’ attorney a letter “…setting a ‘time of the essence’ closing.”</p>
<p>The purchasers’ attorney, in turn, sent correspondence to the seller’s attorney stating that the purchaser “…would not close and again demanded the return of their down payment.” The seller’s attorney would not release the down payment held in escrow and the purchasers sued for the return of their down payment along with other expenses. The seller counterclaimed against the purchasers claiming that the seller was entitled to retain the down payment because the purchasers failed to attend the closing date set in the seller’s “time of the essence” default notice. The Supreme Court (i.e., the trial court) had originally decided in favor of the purchasers and awarded them $17,300 plus interest. The seller appealed and the appellate court overturned the trial court’s decision. The appellate court held that the “…purchasers never placed the seller in default,” and as a result, the purchasers’ failure to close by the date set forth in the seller’s “time of the essence” notice caused the purchasers to be in default and to forfeit the down payment.</p>
<p><strong>A ‘Reasonable Time’ to Cure</strong></p>
<p>The Xelo decision outlines the legal parameters that must be adhered to when a party is attempting to declare the opposing party in default and to set a “time of the essence” closing date. The court explains that “Unless a contract for the sale of real property makes time of the essence, ‘the law will allow the vendor and vendee a reasonable time to perform their respective obligations, regardless of whether they specify a particular date for the closing of title.’” Therefore, if a contract does not explicitly contain a “time of the essence” provision and closing date, the parties are legally entitled to a reasonable time to close and must be provided a reasonable opportunity to cure a defect. If the buyer is not able to perform within such reasonable time, the buyer would forfeit the down payment. Alternatively, if a seller is unable to perform, the buyer can then commence a lawsuit seeking specific performance and a judgment requiring the seller to close.</p>
<p>In another Second Department Appellate Division case, <em>Ashkenazi v. Miller</em> (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3HberLt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3HberLt</a>), the court explains that “What constitutes a reasonable time [for performance] depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.” The court further explained that “Included within a court&#8217;s determination of reasonableness are the nature and object of the contract, the previous conduct of the parties, the presence or absence of good faith, the experience of the parties and the possibility of prejudice or hardship to either one, as well as the specific number of days provided for performance.” The <em>Ashkenazi</em> decision makes clear that “reasonableness” must be determined on a “on a case-by-case basis.”</p>
<p><strong>Notice of Default and Declaration of ‘Time of the Essence’</strong></p>
<p>The court in Xelo explained, in the case of a buyer, that while a buyer normally would be entitled to receive a refund of the down payment where a seller defaults and is unable to cure the default, the buyer is first required to make a demand of the seller to cure the default. The court held that “…it was incumbent upon the purchasers to put the seller in default by tendering performance, demanding that the seller perform her obligations, and giving her a reasonable opportunity to cure the defects.” Therefore, unless the parties are provided with a reasonable time to cure the default, a declaration of default and “time of the essence” notice would not be valid.</p>
<p>Ashkenazi provides that in order for a party to declare time of the essence, “…there must be a clear, distinct, and unequivocal notice to that effect giving the other party a reasonable time in which to act.” It is commonplace for attorneys to provide a 30-day time period as a “reasonable” time for the other party to cure a default—however, that may not always be the case. If the default requires more than 30 days to cure, then the “reasonable” time period could be greater and that must be considered.</p>
<p>In Xelo, the “…rider to the contract of sale specifically provided that violations to be removed by the seller would not constitute objections to title, provided that the seller, at closing, deposited a sum sufficient to remedy the violations within 90 days from the date of closing.” Therefore, the purchasers, according to the contract, did not have a right to cancel or not attend the closing because of the violation, but instead were still required to close because, according to the contract, the seller had 90 days after the closing to clear the violation. Purchasers’ failure or refusal to attend the closing on the time of the essence date, was seen by the court as an anticipatory breach and resulted in the purchasers forfeiting their down payment.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Ready, Willing and Able’ Standard</strong></p>
<p>Most real estate agents are familiar with the “ready, willing and able” concept when it comes to establishing whether a commission has been earned in a real estate transaction. The same concept is also utilized when determining whether a seller or purchaser would be entitled to specific remedies in connection with a breach. Once a party delivers a default notice and “time of the essence” letter, that party must also be ready, willing and able to attend the closing and complete the transaction.</p>
<p>In <em>Martocci v. Schneider</em> (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3olhIiv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3olhIiv</a>), the court held that in order “To prevail on a cause of action for the return of a down payment on a contract for the sale of real property, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant breached or repudiated the contract and that the plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to perform on the closing date.” Similarly, if a seller is sending a “time of essence” letter establishing a “time of the essence” closing date, also known as the “law date,” the seller must be ready, willing and able to close in accordance with the contract of sale, with all title issues cleared, and tender the deed to purchaser.</p>
<p>In most instances, the seller or purchaser must schedule and attend an actual closing. The court in Martocci explained that “…where a seller seeks to hold a purchaser in breach of contract, the seller must establish that [he or she] was ready, willing, and able to perform on the time-of-the-essence closing date, and that the purchaser failed to demonstrate a lawful excuse for its failure to close.”</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Understanding </strong><strong>The Concept of ‘Time of the Essence’</strong></p>
<p>It is important for attorneys and real estate agents to understand the concepts of “time of the essence” and “reasonable time” to cure because clients need to understand the risks and issues that may arise during the course of a transaction. For purchasers, it is important that they understand that if they breach the contract, they could potentially forfeit their entire down payment. It is also important, depending on whether the client is a buyer or seller, to be able to negotiate the amount of the down payment. A lower down payment would put less of the buyer’s funds at risk. As for the seller, the higher the down payment, the less likely the buyer will default or walk away from a transaction.</p>
<p>Real estate agents and attorneys should assist the parties in making sure any issues are addressed in advance so that the parties are not placed in position where they could be held in default. One important goal is to manage the expectations of the parties especially in New York transactions, where the time to close is usually 60 days-90 days. It is important to inform both buyers and sellers that unexpected issues come up all the time and that the closing date in the contract is not a date that is set in stone, in fact, the “on or about” closing date is rarely the actual closing date.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Among repeat home buyers and home sellers over the last year, a key factor for moving was the desire to live closer to family and friends, while an equally important motivator was the need for more space or a bigger home. Sellers as a whole were able to benefit in these transactions, typically earning their full asking price, and selling in one week.</p>
<p>These driving forces to move as well as further sales figures appear in the National Association of Realtors&#8217; 2021 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, a yearly report—now in its 40th year—that analyses demographics, preferences and experiences of buyers and sellers across America. The report was released on Nov. 11.</p>
<p>“During the pandemic, buyers and sellers have been driven by the desire to be close to family and friends, as well as the need for a larger home,” said Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at NAR.</p>
<p>Among sellers, as a group they traded up in price, size and newer residences, as 46% purchased a larger home and 28% purchased the same size home.</p>
<p>Relocating to be closer to family had been increasing in recent years, according to Lautz, however, the COVID-19 outbreak accelerated that trend.</p>
<p>In past years, convenience to work and affordability had ranked as top factors for reasons to move.</p>
<p>The 2021 NAR report comprises an entire year of research in which buyers and sellers purchased or sold a home during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to various other findings, the pandemic likely spurred occupants to shorten their home stay, as tenure in the home decreased to eight years from 10 years, according to the report. This is the largest single-year change in home tenure since NAR began collecting such data.</p>
<p>In general, buyers said they expected to live in their homes for a median of 12 years, while 18% said they were never moving. Historically, tenure in the home has been six to seven years, but experienced an increase to nine to 10 years following the Great Recession.</p>
<p>“Home sellers have historically moved when something in their lives changed – a new baby, a marriage, a divorce or a new job,” said Lautz. “The pandemic has impacted everyone, and for many this became an impetus to sell and make a housing trade.”</p>
<p>The market over the last year saw homes reach record-high prices, paving the way for sellers to secure maximum profits on transactions and leaving buyers to grapple with historically high housing costs. As a result, home buyers typically bought their homes for 100% of the seller&#8217;s asking price, with another 35% purchasing their home for beyond the asking price, according to the report. This 100% median is the highest recorded since 2002. Home sellers reported selling their homes for a median of $85,000 more than their purchase prices, which is a jump from $66,000 last year.</p>
<p>“Buyers moving quickly during the pandemic, coupled with all-time-low inventory, led to a decline in time on market to the shortest ever recorded, which was just one week, “said Lautz. “Only a quarter of home sellers offered incentives to entice potential buyers, down from nearly half of all sellers the year prior.”</p>
<p>On average, buyers said finding a home to purchase took eight weeks, unchanged from last year. Forty-three percent of buyers found virtual tour options to see properties and view listings online to be useful. For a second straight year, buyers reported that just finding the right home to buy continued to be “the most difficult task” for them in the home buying process.</p>
<p>The report found that 41% of recent buyers said they initially looked online for properties as their first step in the process, and another 19% said their first step involved contacting an agent. The majority of buyers and sellers alike eventually turned to a real estate agent or broker to assist in their home transaction. Eighty-seven percent of buyers purchased their residence through an agent or broker, with 7% buying directly from a builder or builder&#8217;s agent. Among home sellers, 90% worked with an agent to sell their home, while 7% were for-sale-by-owner sellers, and less than 1% sold via an iBuyer.</p>
<p>Forty-seven percent of buyers said the agent they used was referred by a friend, neighbor, or relative, and 13% used an agent they had already worked with on a past transaction. Seventy-three percent of buyers reported they needed to interview only one real estate agent during their home search, and a whopping 90% said they would use their agent in the future or recommend the agent to others.</p>
<p>For home sellers, 68% said they became acquainted with their agent via a referral or had used the agent before to buy or sell a home. Eighty-two percent of sellers said they contacted only one agent before finding what they considered to be &#8220;the right agent&#8221; to sell their property.</p>
<p>Fifty-three percent of sellers used the same agent to both purchase and sell their home, while 89% reported that they would recommend their agent for future residential dealings.</p>
<p>“Realtors stepped up in a tremendous way during this pandemic—both in helping sellers list and sell properties, as well as in aiding buyers in finding their dream home during a time of such scarce inventory,” said NAR President Charlie Oppler, a Realtor from Franklin Lakes, NJ and the CEO of Prominent Properties Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty. “We saw so many buyers recommend and refer their Realtors to family and friends, and witnessed sellers lean on Realtors and firms that have helped them in the past.”</p>
<p>Typically, sellers recommended their agent twice since selling their property. Sellers to the tune of 27% referred their agent four or more times since selling their home.</p>
<p>Realtors also assisted a number of first-time buyers over the last year, as the report noted the share of first-time home buyers increased from 31% to 34%, which is the largest jump since 2017. This year, the typical first-time buyer was 33 years old—equal to the previous year. Conversely, the typical repeat buyer age continued to climb, reaching an all-time high of 56 years old.</p>
<p>“As home prices increase, generally first-time buyers are hit hardest because they have no previous home on which to draw equity,” explained Lautz. “Furthermore, in the current environment, these buyers also face soaring rent prices and high student debt balances, which makes it extremely difficult to save for a down payment.”</p>
<p>Twenty-eight percent of first-time buyers reported they used a gift or a loan from friends or family in order to make a down payment on a home and 29% said saving for a down payment proved to be the most difficult step in the entire buying process. For repeat buyers, 56% cited using equity generated from the sale of a primary residence toward their down payment. For first-time buyers, the typical down payment was 7%, while it was 17% among repeat buyers.</p>
<p>A notable revelation in the report was the slight decline in married home buyers. This year&#8217;s data showed that 60% of recent buyers were married, a share that has fallen from a high of 81% in 1985. However, the share of single women buyers increased to 19% from a recent low of 15% in 2014. The shares of single men and unmarried buyers remained at 9%, respectively.</p>
<p>NAR mailed a 129-question survey in July 2021 using a random sample weighted to be representative of sales on a geographic basis to 129,800 recent home buyers. Respondents had the option to fill out the survey via hard copy or online; the online survey was available in English and Spanish. A total of 5,795 responses were received from primary residence buyers. After accounting for undeliverable questionnaires, the survey had an adjusted response rate of 4.5%. The sample at the 95% confidence level has a confidence interval of plus-or-minus 1.29%.</p>
<p>Recent home buyers had to have purchased a primary residence home between July of 2020 and June of 2021.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> recently interviewed and posed “Five Questions” to New York City Council Member and former New York State Assemblywoman Vanessa L. Gibson, who will be taking office in January 2022 as the new Borough President of the Bronx, succeeding Ruben Diaz Jr. who decided not to run for re-election after serving three terms.</p>
<p>Gibson currently represents the Bronx’s 16th Council District where she has advocated for affordable housing, low income families, seniors, LGBTQ rights, gender equity, employment access, and meaningful opportunities for our youth and is serving her second term of office on the New York City Council.</p>
<p>During the 2014-2017 session, Gibson served as Chair of the Council’s Committee on Public Safety, and has the distinction of being both the first woman and first person of color to hold this role. As Chair, she had oversight of the operations and budget of the NYPD, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the District Attorneys and the Special Narcotics prosecutor, and Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-38904" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vanessa-gibson-headshot2-.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="375" />Gibson has been a leader in school safety reform, championed criminal justice reform legislation, and is a vocal proponent of anti-gun violence programs.</p>
<p>Currently, Gibson is a Deputy Leader, Co-Chair of the New York City Council Women&#8217;s Caucus and the second Bronxite to Chair the Committee on Oversight and Investigation. She formally served as the Chair of the Subcommittee on Capital Budget from 2018 – 2020, where she helped oversee the city’s capital investments and changes to the capital process.</p>
<p>Upon being elected to the New York State Assembly in 2009, Gibson embarked an ambitious agenda to improve the quality of life of her constituents in the 77th Assembly District and residents throughout Bronx County. She led efforts to support more education on lupus, championed efforts to support public education, access to affordable housing, higher education at SUNY, affordable and quality healthcare, senior services and youth services. After serving two terms in the State Assembly, she was elected to the New York City Council in November 2013.</p>
<p>The Morris Heights resident s a life-long New Yorker, graduate of the city’s Public-School system, and an alumna of SUNY Albany (undergraduate) and Baruch College, where she received her MPA.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The Bronx was the most hard-hit borough in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic with an unemployment rate that reached 25%. The jobless rate has since dropped to 12.4% as of September 2021 but is still the highest of all the boroughs in New York. What will you do to try and get more Bronx residents back to work?</p>
<p><strong>Gibson:</strong> So, I appreciate the question and certainly am aware of the high unemployment rate that we are facing now as a result of COVID. One in every four Bronxites lost their income as well as their employment due to the pandemic. A lot of the jobs we lost in the Bronx are in the hotel and retail industries and as we rebound and return to normalcy, I do believe that many of those workers will eventually go back to work, but the question is when, because obviously it goes hand-in-hand with tourism, nightlife, Broadway, with sports venues and really everything we know and love about New York City coming back to normal. So, as Borough President I will work feverishly with the administration, with Eric Adams, on making sure we can find ways to create new jobs.</p>
<p>I think we have to look at the tech industry. We have to look at worker cooperatives. We have to look at ways that we can build out entrepreneurs and also support small business. If we provide them with tax incentives and other support, we can get businesses to hire more locally right in their own communities—our supermarkets, the grocery stores, the bodegas. I really want to make sure we are investing in the small “Mom and Pop” shops and merchants that have been really decimated during the pandemic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-38905 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Gibson1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="258" />I recognize that a lot of our larger employers are Montefiore, the health industry and the District Attorney’s Office. But, what we are now learning is not every Bronx resident wants to physically go back to work in an office setting and I think that is concerning for a number of reasons because people have been used to these two years now of working remotely, of doing a lot of things at home that we didn’t know that we could do before and we now can. So, I think there is a little bit of anxiety and hesitancy on many residents returning back to a work setting that is in an office with people and consumers and clients visiting. I think it is a lot of building that we have to do and a lot of partnerships working with the Merchants Association, our BIDs, the Chambers of Commerce, working with the administration to find ways to get Bronxites back to work.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> During your campaign, you stated that New York City Housing Authority tenants continue to face mold, rat infestation, leaks, malfunctioning elevators, poor lighting, a lack of security, lead paint and asbestos. You characterized NYCHA as “the worst landlord in New York City.” What must be done to turn around conditions in the city’s public housing properties?</p>
<p><strong>Gibson:</strong> Public housing needs a serious makeover starting from the federal government to the state and local governments. We have to find ways to reinvest. We have to look at instituting more Section 8 vouchers for residents to live in public housing. But, from a local level, we have to make sure that NYCHA spends the money that we give it. This administration under Mayor (Bill) de Blasio has invested billions of dollars in NYCHA from new boilers, new roofs, elevators, facades, a lot of infrastructure. But, guess what, NYCHA is not spending the money and drawing down on the funds as expeditiously as it could. I think that speaks volumes to the capital process and the procurement process; what is happening from the point of the allocation to the actual groundbreaking. Do we have enough designers and architects? Do we have enough vendors that are actually applying for these RFPS (Request for Proposals) so they can be awarded contracts?</p>
<p>The contracting process needs to be seriously reformed, involving the (City) Comptroller’s Office. So, residents of NYCHA have been far too patient for too long. They are living with rodents, with rats, with mole infestation and it is just disgusting. And there was a time years ago when it was attractive to live in New York City housing. Since then we have seen disinvestment from the federal, state and local governments. In my own capital budget in my eight years on the (City) Council, I have invested my own dollars—$10 million to be exact—to transform my developments (in her district) because I know that if I wait for NYCHA things will not get done. I am the one putting the lighting, the LED lights, the playgrounds, the basketball courts and we’re putting in cameras and other security measures. So, we have to do a lot better, but I think that with the new administration, with a new regional administrator that we are getting in Alicka Ampry Samuel, I think we will see a lot of changes happening.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-38902 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Gibson-3.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="291" />Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Another key issue you identified in your campaign was the need for more affordable housing in the Bronx and you also said that you would work with partners in government to facilitate new construction that prioritizes veterans, seniors, youth aging out of foster care, grandparents raising their grandchildren and LGBTQ Bronx residents. How can you make this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Gibson:</strong> I think you make that happen by building a coalition, by working with labor and the (building) trades industry. I am going to formulate a working group with Laborers Local 79 as well as mason tenders, electricians and carpenters because we want to make sure we are having conversations at the beginning of projects before they go through the ULURP process. We want to make sure there are guaranteed jobs, local hiring provisions, MWBE set-asides so that we can have local businesses apply and get access to these job opportunities. We also want to make sure formerly incarcerated men and women are able to get a lot of these jobs as well. We support prevailing wage and union wage and good-paying jobs that provide a real pathway to the middle-class. When we work with the Adams administration, we will be working with (NYC) HPD to look at the existing term sheets to see if there could be areas of improvement, programs like SARA (Senior Affordable Rental Apartments) and ELLA (Extremely Low-and Low-Income Affordability Program) that drive certain types of development. We support extremely low-income housing, but we also support mixed-income housing because we have a lot of two-parent households that are making incomes above minimum wage, but they are not wealthy. They are working class people that need affordable and quality housing.</p>
<p>I also am going to champion ownership opportunities. I want to build more homes because I want people to own property. I don’t think we should envision being tenants the rest of our lives and when you look at initiatives like Community Land Trusts, that is the way to build economic wealth and power in the Bronx. I am going to be championing that with Northwest Bronx, Nos Quedamos, and Banana Kelly and so many organizations that are on the ground that have been building in the Bronx for many, many years and now that we have the opportunities in economic development, I want to make sure that we are getting local jobs and MWBE apprenticeship opportunities and we are really creating the access middle class people will need to affordable housing, good jobs and sustainable living.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> During the campaign you said improving the Bronx’s low vaccination rate would be a top priority. According to city data, 69% of all Bronx residents have received at least one shot of the COVID vaccine, the second lowest rate of all five boroughs, and below the citywide average of 74%. What can be done to get more Bronx residents to take the shot?</p>
<p><strong>Gibson:</strong> A lot of education and outreach and honestly, I need medical professionals of color to come into communities of color and talk to the residents. Many in the communities that I serve today, immigrant communities of color, there is a deep-rooted history around vaccinations and so many people of color are worried about side effects, they have underlying health conditions and they just don’t trust and believe in science. I support vaccines, I support mandates, I support any effort to keep people safe and healthy and I have lost too many people. The Bronx has the highest death rate due to COVID due to underlying health conditions like asthma, heart disease, obesity and diabetes to name a few.</p>
<p>So, what do we need. We need community-based health centers and we need a real community-oriented approach with cultural diversity and sensitivity, language access and we need to be able to have affordable, convenient locations in the Bronx where we can meet people where they are. The number one issue of why people are not getting vaccinated revolves around transportation—they can’t get to and from locations. So, we have to make it easy and affordable and meet people where they are in their own communities.</p>

Are investors returning to the Bronx and are there any specific projects of note you would like to point out that are either under construction or in the pipeline?</p>
<p><strong>Gibson:</strong> Absolutely, there are a lot of capital projects that are now re-starting as a result of the pause during the pandemic. I am working on the Bronx Children’s Museum, the Universal Hip-Hop Museum. We have $100 million invested to transform Orchard Beach, specifically the Pavilion, we are expanding Metro North with four stations in Co-Op City, Morris Park (Hunts Point, Parkchester and Van Nest) in the East Bronx. We are also looking at a lot of development in the South Bronx; the old Spofford (former Juvenile Detention facility); La Central on Westchester Ave. and 149th St. We are opening community centers in the Northeast and South Bronx. There is a lot of economic development and jobs and a lot of opportunity. Unfortunately, a lot of construction and noise, but it is temporary pain for our long-term benefit. And I will be making sure that I am overseeing all of these projects as Borough President and working with the developers. I have a groundbreaking on Thursday (Nov. 17) on River Ave. for a development with more than 600 units of affordable housing by Mack Equities.</p>
<p>There is a lot happening and I am excited and I also look forward to expanding on that in other neighborhoods that don’t necessarily have a lot of affordable and moderate-income housing.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Bronx&#8217;s thriving real estate market showed no signs of slowing in the third quarter of 2021. The dwindling housing supply and rising demand have resulted in a steady flow of transactions throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>The Bronx has also been one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest job losses among the country&#8217;s major metropolitan areas. Bronx has been recovering from the economic effects of the pandemic. The demand for housing is outpacing the supply, favoring home sellers who are managing to hold good leverage in price negotiations.</p>
<p>In the third quarter of 2021, while some homebuyers chose to persevere through bidding wars, escalation clauses, and line-out-the-door open houses, others decided to put their buying on hold and rent for the time being.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38880 aligncenter" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bronx-Q3-2021.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="622" />Buyers in the Bronx paid 10% to 20% more than they would have pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Buyers are shopping for properties all over the Bronx with Spencer Estates in Country Club, Morris Park, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens as the most sought-after expensive neighborhoods in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Based on current market conditions, the supply and demand dynamics will likely push prices north again over the next 12 months. Mortgage rates remaining low, pent-up demand, and good discounts will keep the demand high in 2021. The New York housing market could favor sellers over buyers.</p>
<p>Despite the pervasiveness of sticker shock, some buyers are choosing to charge forward in today’s less feverish market to secure a home and lock in a historically low (and rising) mortgage rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prices will continue to go up as long as the mortgage rates remain low. Another reason for the housing demand going up is that the Millennials are buying properties more than ever&#8221; said Emran Bhuiyan with EXIT Realty Premium.</p>
<p>The Bronx housing market is still moving upward, albeit at a slow pace. That slowing, or so-called normalization, is expected to continue into next year: The housing market will cool off in 2022, but not by much.</p>
<p>I anticipate price growth will slow down in 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>OSSINING—Downtown revitalization efforts in the Village of Ossining and across the Hudson in the Town of Haverstraw each got a $10-million infusion of cash.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced at an event held at the Joseph G. Caputo Community Center here on Nov. 22 that Haverstraw and Ossining will receive $10 million each in funding as the Mid-Hudson region winners of the fifth round of the Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI).</p>
<p>As part of DRI Round 5, each of the state&#8217;s 10 regional economic development regions are being awarded $20 million, to make for a total state commitment of $200 million in funding and investments to help communities boost their post COVID-19 economies by transforming downtowns into vibrant neighborhoods. Haverstraw and Ossining now join the cities of Middletown, Kingston, New Rochelle and Peekskill, which were the Mid-Hudson Region&#8217;s winners in the first four DRI rounds, respectively.</p>
<p>“Our downtowns are the hubs for communities to connect and thrive, and as a former local official I know personally how transformative this funding can be to boost quality of life,” Gov. Hochul said. “Through our Downtown Revitalization Initiative, we will continue to give communities, like Ossining and Haverstraw, across the state the extra boost they need to recover from the pandemic and create more viable, livable, walkable downtowns.”</p>
<p>In this fifth round of the DRI, Gov. Hochul doubled funding from $100 million to $200 million and allowed each Regional Economic Development Council to decide whether to nominate two $10 million awardees or one $20 million awardee for transformative and catalytic downtown redevelopment projects. The DRI is led by the Department of State and through its partnership with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), technical support to the awardees will be provided to assist them with including carbon neutral principles in support of the state&#8217;s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050.</p>
<p>Haverstraw Mayor Michael Kohut said, “Thank you, Governor Hochul, for this great honor. I&#8217;m extremely proud of the collective time, dedication and effort that went into our Downtown Revitalization Initiative plan. My thanks to everyone who helped us to reach this summit and bring home this targeted economic development funding.”</p>
<p>Ossining Mayor Rika Levin said, “This is an exciting day for Ossining, and a testament to the hard work of so many people here in the village. Thank you, Governor Hochul, for delivering this $10 million commitment to our community. We look forward to the great projects and progress that this funding supports.”</p>
<p>Haverstraw&#8217;s downtown is a high-density neighborhood close to the Hudson riverfront. The village of Haverstraw aims to make this area an inclusive, lively, 21st century urban center where residents and visitors can live, work, learn and play. Haverstraw has stayed committed to downtown revitalization with multiple completed and ongoing projects, including multiple mixed-use developments, a new waterfront esplanade, and streetscape improvements. Building on this work, Haverstraw aims to redevelop vacant space, expand public space, increase the economic activity of and access to the waterfront, as well as embrace their diverse history, state officials noted.</p>
<p>Ossining&#8217;s DRI will focus on the Waterfront District. With a downtown that is on both the New York State and the National Historic Registers, Ossining wants to use their existing assets, including a rich history, public amenities, engaged residents, and an innovative business community, to build on previous successes and strengthen their downtown to have the greatest economic impact. Previous successes include a mixed-use development with a waterfront park, promenade, beach, and fishing pier on a former brownfield, the Sing Sing Kill Greenway, and the ongoing Sing Sing Prison Museum project. Building on these projects, Ossining aims to improve community services, increase access to and the economic impact of the waterfront, expand public space, and repurpose areas for development.</p>
<p>The Mid-Hudson Region Economic Development Council conducted a thorough and competitive review process of proposals submitted from communities throughout the region and considered seven criteria below before recommending Haverstraw and Ossining as the nominees.</p>
<p>Mid Hudson Regional Economic Development Council Chair Dr. Donald P. Christian, President, SUNY New Paltz said, “Congratulations to Ossining and Haverstraw for their outstanding plans for revisioning their downtown communities. These investments will help to energize their downtowns, grow local businesses and transform their communities. The DRI&#8217;s innovative and thoughtful projects have made a real difference around the state and will further support our work to reimagine and rebuild an even stronger New York for the future.”</p>
<p>Led by the Department of State, an interagency team of state experts will work with Haverstraw and Ossining to begin the process of developing a Strategic Investment Plan to revitalize their downtowns with up to $300,000 in planning funds from the $10 million DRI grant. Local Planning Committees made up of municipal representatives, community leaders, and other stakeholders will lead the effort, supported by a team of private sector experts and state planners.</p>
<p>The Strategic Investment Plans will examine local assets and opportunities and identify economic development, transportation, housing, and community projects that align with each community&#8217;s vision for downtown revitalization and that are poised for implementation. The Strategic Investment Plans will guide the investment of DRI grant funds in revitalization projects that can leverage and expand upon the state&#8217;s $10-million investment. Plans for the DRI&#8217;s fifth round will be complete in 2022.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The PEL Study Group is also recommending that interchange upgrades be undertaken at exits in Orange and Sullivan counties and that improvements be made in the region to improve connectivity to existing transit. The scope of the construction of the General Use Third Lane beginning Exit 131 in Harrima]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>POUGHKEEPSIE—The highly anticipated final report from the New York State Department of Transportation’s Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group is recommending the state move forward with a General Use Third Lane in each direction on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties that could if built as one major project cost anywhere from $650 million to $1.27 billion to complete.</p>
<p>The PEL Study Group is also recommending that interchange upgrades be undertaken at exits in Orange and Sullivan counties and that improvements be made in the region to improve connectivity to existing transit. The scope of the construction of the General Use Third Lane beginning at Exit 131 in Harriman (Orange County) to Exit 103 (Rapp Road) in Monticello in Sullivan County would determine the cost of the project. Option 1, which involves using the basic existing footprint of the roadway and shoulders to accommodate a third lane in each direction would cost $385 million to $470 million for the Orange County stretch of roadway and another $265 million to $325 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>Under Option 2, which would involve widening the existing roadway to accommodate the third lane expansions in both directions so that most of Route 17 would conform to federal Interstate standards, the costs would escalate. For the Orange County stretch, the cost would run between $615 million to $750 million, while the Sullivan County component’s cost ranges from $425 million to $520 million.</p>
<p>The PEL Study Group did not recommend one option over the other and also while listing interchanges in Orange and Sullivan counties that could be upgraded, it did not issue any specific recommendations, although it did point out those with the greatest need.</p>
<p>In referencing the need for a General Use Third Lane, the study group stated, “Reconstruction under the General Use Third Lane Alternative would provide the opportunity to address deficiencies in the existing roadway to correct non-standard features and storm-related flooding. High crash locations containing curves and overpasses would benefit from widening shoulders, increasing pavement friction, and increased banking (removal of non-conforming super elevation) under this concept. Increasing the capacity of Route 17 would provide a 24% reduction in congestion related crashes overall, per the Crash Modification Factors Clearinghouse.”</p>
<p>The study indicated the cost of the interchange upgrades in Orange County could run from $135 million to $175 million and in Sullivan County from $43 million to $144 million.</p>
<p>Improvements to Connectivity to Existing Transit projects are projected to cost between $1 million to $1.5 million in Sullivan County and $9 million to $10 million in Orange County.</p>
<p>The study group also recommended moving forward with a No Build scenario, but that was done chiefly because it is a requirement of the National Environmental Policy Review Act (NEPA) process for any proposed Route 17 project. The group also considered the construction of a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane and the addition of Light Rail and Bus Rapid Transit but did not recommend going forward on any of those options.</p>
<p>While study group officials have stated at previous virtual public workshops that the full project would likely not move forward all at once due to funding constraints and other factors, the report listed the total project cost involving the construction of the General Use Third Lane, interchange improvements and improvements to connectivity to existing transit projects would run from $529 million to $935 million in Orange County and $309 million to $665.5 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>While the Route 17 expansion may qualify for some federal funding, it is likely that the overall project would be done in phases and based on the report it appears work would begin on a stretch of the roadway in Orange County.</p>
<p>“As previously noted, NYSDOT will determine the logical termini and specific project limits of the General Use Third Lane Alternative in the future, following careful consideration of existing and projected traffic congestion, public and agency input, and available funding,” the report stated. “Based on this Route 17 PEL Study, the area of greatest need appears to be between Exits 120 (NY Route 211 – Wallkill) and 131 (Woodbury), a distance of approximately 22 miles, and the segment of the corridor that is projected to experience the highest levels of congestion in the year 2055.”</p>
<p>Advocates for the Route 17 expansion were heartened to learn that the project could receive funding from the $1.2-trillion infrastructure bill recently signed into law by President Biden when U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-CD18) listed the Route 17 project at a press conference in Newburgh on Nov. 8 as one that could qualify for federal funding. He referenced the Infrastructure Act’s $13.5 billion that will go directly to New York State’s highways and bridges, and said that revamping Route 17 through Orange County is “a much-needed project that has been stalled for too long.”</p>
<p>“Route 17 can receive funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” a spokesman for Rep. Maloney said. “However, the law does not directly earmark funds to specific projects. It will be up to New York State to determine how to dedicate their funds from this legislation to projects like Route 17. However, as he has throughout the legislative process drafting the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Rep. Maloney will continue to fight for funding for critical projects and priorities here in the Hudson Valley.”</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Transportation released a statement in connection with the release of the final PEL study, which stated: &#8220;The objectives of the Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) study were to advance preliminary activities related to improving the level of service, meeting current design standards, facilitating public transportation alternatives and addressing the resiliency of the Route 17 corridor in Orange and Sullivan counties. Recommendations for renewing and modernizing the travel corridor, including construction of a third-travel lane, would need be addressed in a federally required Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The EIS would address the engineering, social, economic and environmental impacts associated with potential corridor alternatives. If the preferred alternative was to construct a third travel lane, the EIS would also include any necessary mitigation actions/strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The PEL process is being initiated by the NYSDOT in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration. The DOT last year began a scoping and preliminary review process as part of the $5 million PEL study, whose funding was secured through the 2018-2019 state budget.</p>
<p>The PEL study is a follow-up to a NYSDOT study released in May 2013 that examined the corridor between Monticello, Exit 103 (Rapp Road) and Harriman, Exit 131 (New York State Thruway) to help accommodate transportation demands brought about by economic growth in the region and to help accommodate future growth.</p>
<p>The 2013 final report recommended: adding a general use third lane, in each direction, from Interstate 87 in Harriman to just west of Middletown, Orange County; improve key interchanges in Orange and Sullivan counties; provide new and expanded park and ride lots at strategic locations in Orange and Sullivan counties and recommend some provisions for future transit.</p>
<p>The 17-Forward 86 Coalition has lobbied for the state to conduct the PEL study and now with the report completed will be shifting its focus to securing federal and state funding for the expansion project.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, President and CEO of the Orange County Partnership in Goshen and co-chair of the 17-Forward-86 Coalition, said, “We thank Governor Hochul, New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Dominguez and the DOT team for finalizing the Planning and Environment Linkages (PEL) report for the Route 17 corridor, and Senator Schumer and Congressman Maloney for their continued support. We founded the 17-Forward-86 Coalition with the goal of expanding capacity on Route 17 and our effort to add a third lane across the corridor is nearing success. The PEL will help accelerate the delivery of specific projects to add a third lane along the corridor to ensure continued economic growth and an improved quality of life in our region.”</p>
<p>Marc Baez, President and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership and 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair, added, “We are so pleased New York State is moving forward with efforts to improve mobility and enhance safety on our roads. As we work toward an economic recovery, the quality of our infrastructure will play a key role in the future of our region and our state. Expanding the Route 17 corridor is crucial to that. We look forward to working with the DOT and the administration on moving through the next phases of the environmental process and securing construction funds in the upcoming DOT capital plan.”</p>

The same day the DEC also rejected an air permit for the Astoria Gas Turbine Power project in Queens.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—While environmental groups and state politicians, including Gov. Kathy Hochul praised the decision in late October by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to deny a key air permit for the Danskammer Energy project here, key business, trade and economic development organizations have lined up in support of Danskammer’s recently filed appeal of the DEC denial.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation announced on Oct. 27 that it had <strong><a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/commercial/ny-state-dec-denies-key-permits-for-danskammer-energy-plant-in-newburgh-energy-project-in-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied a Title V air permit</a></strong> for the $500-million Danskammer Energy Center project in Newburgh. The same day the DEC also rejected an air permit for the Astoria Gas Turbine Power project in Queens.</p>
<p>On Nov. 24, Danskammer Energy announced it had appealed the DEC air permit ruling. Danskammer Energy CEO Bill Reid said in a prepared statement: “Danskammer Energy disagrees with the NYSDEC’s denial of our federal Title V Air Permit and we are appealing the decision to preserve our rights as part of the agency’s administrative review process. We believe DEC is holding Danskammer to standards that don’t even exist because the Climate Action Council has yet to issue guidance on what it means to be consistent with the state’s new climate law.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, “Further—as pointed out by the New York Independent System Operator in its 2021-2030 Comprehensive Reliability Plan—as more weather-dependent and unpredictable wind and solar are used to supply our electricity, New York needs power options like a repowered Danskammer that can quickly step in to keep the lights on. For these reasons, DEC’s decision to deny our Title V Air Permit was unjustified, and not in the best interests of New York residents or their future power needs.”</p>
<p>The Danskammer Energy project, which had been valued at $500 million, is in the Article 10 process before the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment. The proposed project would convert the aging Danskammer plant into a 535-megawatt energy facility. The project cannot move forward without the Title V air permit.</p>
<p>In the DEC’s 14-page decision, Daniel Whitehead, director, division of environmental permits for the DEC, stated that Danskammer had the right to request an administrative adjudicatory hearing regarding the denial of its Title V Application. Danskammer was required to submit a request in writing within 30 days of that ruling.</p>
<p>The Independent Power Producers of New York, an Albany-based industry trade group criticized the denial of Danskammer and the Astoria Gas Turbine projects when first announced and praised Danskammer’s appeal.</p>
<p>IPPNY President and CEO Gavin J. Donohue said, “IPPNY members support Danskammer Energy’s decision to appeal the DEC’s denial of its Title V Air Permit. As I stated when the decision was handed down last month, New York will need power options that can start up quickly and back up wind and solar in order to keep our lights on. There has been no firm guidance provided for how permit decisions will be made under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, and the DEC’s decision to deny seems largely subjective and bad policy. Danskammer provides New York with an opportunity to reduce emissions in the near-term and would assist New York in meeting its climate goals all while ensuring that New Yorkers aren’t left in the dark.”</p>
<p>The Orange County Partnership, an economic development organization based in Goshen, also expressed support for the Danskammer project. Orange County Partnership President and CEO, Maureen Halahan stated, “Danskammer Energy’s decision to appeal the denial of its air permit was necessary and welcomed by residents and businesses in the Hudson Valley. While the Partnership supports the growth of renewables, we must maintain and bolster the facilities that are the backbone of our energy system to ensure electric prices stay low and the lights stay on. The Danskammer Energy project would be a win for our local economy and all who live and work here.”</p>
<p>The project has also been supported by organized labor. Earlier this year it received a major endorsement from the New York State AFL-CIO. L. Todd Diorio, president of the Hudson Valley Building and Construction Trades Council based in Newburgh, said the more than 8,000 members of the 29 affiliated Local Unions of the building trades council are supportive of Danskammer’s decision to appeal the DEC ruling.</p>
<p>“This is a project that is good for the air, creates local jobs, lowers energy bills and has the support of dozens of local, stakeholders and organizations in the Hudson Valley,” Diorio, who is also business manager of Laborers Local No. 17 in Newburgh, said. “As the governor heads into what is likely to be a contentious primary, this denial was transparently political and she did not have the best interests of New Yorkers when she supported the denial of this permit.”</p>
<p>Diorio continued, “Let’s be clear, the Hudson Valley Building and Construction Trades Council is not anti-renewable energy and is working closely with elected officials to ensure renewable projects, such as solar, which is growing rapidly in the Hudson Valley, pay good wages and benefits like Danskammer has agreed to. We also believe the state’s CLCPA goals of 70% by 2030 are unreachable and this project is the perfect bridge. We thank Danskammer for continuing its efforts to bring 500 plus union jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenue to our area.”</p>
<p>In announcing the denial of the Danskammer air permit, DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos said, the project is not in compliance with the requirements of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. “The proposed project would be inconsistent with or would interfere with the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits established in the Climate Act,” Seggos said. “Danskammer failed to demonstrate the need or justification for the proposed project notwithstanding this inconsistency.”</p>
<p>The DEC’s denial drew praise from environmental groups like Scenic Hudson and from New York Gov. Hochul, who said, “I applaud the Department of Environmental Conservation’s decisions to deny the Title V permits for the Danskammer Energy Center and Astoria Gas Turbine Power, LLC in the context of our state’s clean energy transition. Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time, and we owe it to future generations to meet our nation-leading climate and emissions reduction goals.”</p>

<p>Joseph Farrell, owner of The Farrell Building Co., which is based in Bridgehampton, NY, told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the firm purchased the property for $16.5 million. The deal closed on Nov. 29.</p>
<p>The French-American School released a statement on Nov. 30 announcing the sale of the former Ridgeway Country Club property in the Gedney Farms section of White Plains, thus ending an 11-year quest to consolidate its three existing campuses to the site.</p>
<p>The sale includes four parcels that comprised the former Ridgeway Country Club that FASNY purchased in December 2010: Parcel A, that in November 2017 was approved by the City of White Plains for the construction of its Secondary School (grades 6-12) consisting of 27.7 acres between Ridgeway, Hathaway Lane, and Gedney Esplanade; Parcel B, 14 acres between Gedney Esplanade and Heatherbloom Road; Parcel C, 15.6 acres between Heatherbloom and Bryant Avenue; and Parcel D, 72.3 acres between Hathaway, Ridgeway, Bryant and North Street.</p>
<p>The property is zoned R1-30 allowing single-family residential lots of 30,000 square feet.</p>
<p>FASNY purchased the former Ridgeway County Club property in December 2010 for $11 million and proposed the property as the location for a proposed new school campus. Following a protracted approval process and ensuing legal battle with neighborhood group the Gedney Association, FASNY entered a stipulation of settlement with the city in 2016 and in 2017 ultimately obtained a site plan and special use permit for a reduced project for its Secondary School (grades 6-12) on Parcel A.</p>
<p>FASNY made key revisions to its original plan to secure site plan approval from the White Plains Common Council that included keeping Hathaway Lane open, the elimination of the Lower School (nursery through fifth grade) from the project, which reduced the student population at the property by 33% from 950 to 640. The revised plan also reduces the total building square footage from 243,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. The plan as originally proposed was estimated to be valued at $60 million.</p>
<p>In 2019 FASNY listed Parcels B, C and D for sale. FASNY said in its statement that over the course of the last couple of years, the space requirements and planning needs of the school evolved and shifted, leading to the conclusion that selling the entire property was in the school’s best future interests.</p>
<p>FASNY offered its sincere, heartfelt thanks for the extensive support it received for its plan throughout the approval process from individuals and organizations across White Plains and the greater community.</p>
<p>The group specifically thanked White Plains Mayor Tom Roach and the members of the White Plains Common Council who voted to approve the school’s plan, as well as the city corporation counsel and department commissioners and staff; the leaders and supporters of White Plains Neighbors ACT; the coalition of White Plains religious leaders; local and regional environmental organizations; the Business Council of Westchester, the Westchester County Association and local businesses; as well as those who signed petitions, wrote letters and spoke at public hearings in favor of the school plan.</p>
<p>Founded in 1980 as a one-classroom preschool, FASNY has evolved to become an international and bilingual N-12-day school educating more than 720 students on three campuses in Mamaroneck and Larchmont. It is the only school in the New York metropolitan area accredited to offer both the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma and the French baccalaureate. All students also graduate with a New York State high school diploma.</p>
<p>Farrell Building Co., widely known for developing luxury single-family homes on Long Island and in the Palm Beach, FL area, announced in October 2019 it had entered the Hudson Valley with several new projects. The White Plains project will be its first in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Farrell Building Company announced plans to develop new luxury rental properties in Newburgh, Middletown and New Windsor, in Orange County, as well as in Fishkill, Beacon, and Wappingers in Dutchess County. Its project in Middletown on East Main Street is currently under construction on former farm land leading into the City of Middletown.</p>
<p>Farrell in a phone interview with <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> said that he plans to build luxury single-family homes at the property, with most priced in the $1.8-million to $3-million range. He did not divulge how many units his firm plans to develop there and expects to meet with city officials soon and then file plans for the project.</p>
<p>“I think there is a huge need for empty nesters who want to scale down from their big houses in Scarsdale and surrounding areas,” he said. The firm intends to build a “beautiful clubhouse” and create “a great, great, really high-end neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“Westchester is a beautiful place. I think we are at a moment in time that we have never seen before where all of the housing has been purchased in the surrounding area of New York City and I believe it is an unbelievable opportunity… He added that most of the existing product that is for sale in Westchester has to be renovated, which will make his new high-end product attractive.</p>
<p>Farrell said that the firm would not be looking for any zoning variances and that the plan’s scope would be as of right and conform with its current zoning limitations.</p>

<p><em>(Editor’s Note: Part two of a two-part series)</em></p>
<p>In the first part of my <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/legal-advocacy/barristers-briefing-stand-up-and-deliver-cooperation-courtesy-and-the-code-of-ethics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Stand and Deliver”</a> column for <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> published in the November edition, I noted that with the holidays fast approaching, it seemed an appropriate time to give a refresher on the need for Realtors to cooperate, show courtesy and to abide by the Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>In Part One I covered the Preamble to the Code of Ethics, key words and ideals that set Realtors apart from other licensees, Article 1, Showing Requirements and Rule Enforcement Facilitators.</p>
<p>One of the strongest Articles in the Code of Ethics is Article 3. It requires that “Realtors shall cooperate with other brokers except when cooperation is not in the client’s best interests.” It doesn’t say “may cooperate” or “should cooperate,” it says “shall cooperate.” That is tantamount to MUST cooperate. This cooperation extends to any licensed real estate agent, not just Realtors or members of our association or OneKey MLS participants. It applies to ALL licensees. Cooperation can be many things. It can be:</p>

<div class="siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget">
<p>The most common offenses are relating to showings. As noted above, timing for a showing is crucial. Realtors have only an hour or two to confirm showings. Realtors must be diligent and responsive; otherwise, not only might they be fined by a Facilitator, but they might also be brought up on Article 1 and Article 3 violations. Worse still, discrimination claims might be leveled if the agent/party requesting the showing are part of a protected class. Such claims of discrimination may raise an Article 10 violation, as well as state or federal discrimination claims. Regardless of whether you successfully defend yourself, all these things can result in time spent filing paperwork, speaking with legal or Realtor counsel, hearings and lawsuits and less time focused on your profession. They distract and consume your time and finances. It is best to simply respond timely. Cooperate.</p>
<p>With regard to “Coming Soon” listings, ensure that no one is permitted to enter the property under any circumstances. That would be a blatant violation of Article 1 and Article 3. With office exclusives, ensure that if a licensee requests a showing, they are immediately scheduled; simply because a property is an office exclusive does not mean that a Realtor does not have to cooperate.</p>
<p>As a cooperating Realtor, make sure you show up on time. No Realtor is permitted to enter a property outside of the scheduled time. To do so is criminal trespassing and you may be speaking to the police, as well as finding yourself at a Professional Standards hearing. Do not enter a property outside of the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Do not schedule a showing and then send only the buyers/tenants or send another Realtor in your place. When you schedule a showing you are agreeing to be present at the showing and comply with the showing instructions. If you do, you not only expose yourself to violating Article 3 (SOP 3-9), but you also expose that other Realtor who shows the property as well. And if no Realtor is present and only the buyers/tenants appear, then you expose them to criminal charges of trespassing and potentially expose you and your brokerage to litigation if something on the property goes missing or is damaged. Simply put, comply with the showing instructions and be present.</p>
<p>During these times of COVID, ensure that you abide by any showing protocols concerning the production of COVID forms, mask wearing, wiping down surfaces, and the maximum amounts of people allowed inside. Not only can a Realtor violate the Code by failing to comply, but you are risking people’s lives.</p>
<p>Ensure that all offers are timely presented. This means, present them objectively and as soon as possible. A Realtor cannot hold off on presenting offers based on their personal convenience (for example, an agent goes away for a long weekend and waits to present the offers or holding all offers until after an open house). Unless the owner has instructed the agent to do this, it’s a violation of the Code.</p>
<p>If an agent requests an executed Offer Acknowledgement Form, or a Sworn Declaration Statement that an offer has been presented, you MUST respond timely. Again, failure to do so may result in fines and/or a hearing for Article 1 and Article 3 violation. Don’t make the mistake of ignoring such a demand, hoping that it’ll just go away. Cooperate with your fellow real estate agents. Same goes for a demand to be present for an offer presentation (OneKey Rule 405.4). Unless instructed by your client, you must arrange for that agent to be “present” (in person, on the phone, cc on e-mail, etc.) when that offer is presented.</p>
<p>Cooperation is simple. Quite often, the claim that a Realtor is not cooperating is a result of an accumulation of delays, non-responses, halfhearted communications and neglect. All Realtors must timely communicate, as it’s in the best interests of their clients. Providing keys for a non-member or assisting with access is required. Assisting with showings is required. Providing current and accurately required documentation is required. The list goes on and on; however, much of it is common sense.</p>
<p>Cooperation’s foundations are in the Preamble. As Realtors we hold ourselves out as consummate professionals and experts in our field. Failing to abide by these principles damages all Realtors and what we stand for. We can’t raise this weighty bar if everyone isn’t lifting it. Realtors need to acknowledge their responsibility and, in turn, identify those that fail to cooperate, those that fail to lift the bar. Realtors need to cooperate and Stand Up and Deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Article 10: Discrimination</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think much needs to be said here. The language is clear, and the lawsuits are coming in fast and furiously: “Realtors shall not deny equal professional services for reasons of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, nation origin, sexual orientation or gender identity.” This applies to your treatment of members of the public, as well as other real estate professionals. Realtors should treat all people equally. Not only can you violate the Code, but you can be found in violation of state and federal law too.</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that “the road to hell is paved with good intentions.” As Realtors, we often try to help clients find what is best; however, in doing so, we forget to ask the client what they want. Never assume a person of color wishes to live where other persons of color reside. Same goes for religion, national origin, and those with other obvious and visible factors. Don’t assume that a family with young children or someone that is elderly doesn’t want to live near a busy highway. Always ask what someone’s preferences are. Document them and then do your research.</p>
<p>Recently added to Article 10 is SOP 10-5. This rule prohibits the use of “harassing speech, hate speech, epithets, or slurs based on race, cold, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, nation origin, sexual orientation or gender identity.” In promulgating this rule, NAR determined that this rule would apply to all Realtors during all their activities, not just their activities related to real estate. While some might argue that this is a violation of their First Amendment rights, legal professionals have indicated that this is not the case. As a voluntary association, member can choose to belong. If they do, they must comply with the association rules. If not, they can choose to disassociate, or their membership can be terminated. What is clear is that Realtors must hold themselves to a higher standard. Discrimination, in any form, is unacceptable and runs in the face of what the Preamble establishes. All Realtors must identify offenders and report them, not only to the association but to the local, state, and federal authorities. Realtors must Stand Up and Deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Article 15: False/Misleading Statements</strong></p>
<p>The final Article that we’ll address relates to Realtor conduct. Article 15 asserts that “Realtors shall not knowingly or recklessly make false or misleading statements about other real estate professionals, their businesses, or their business practices.” The old adage is that “If you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all,” and that seems to apply here. Realtors should avoid disparaging other Realtors. There is no benefit from it, and it only goes to promoting self-interests. “If a Realtor is engaging in transgressions, after confirming such actions, that Realtor should be reported. Careless, reckless restatements about what may have been heard, or restating what was assumed were facts without confirmation should be avoided at all costs. Restating or republishing false statements is a violation too.</p>
<p>To those agents that are quick to cut, quick to criticize, comment or disparage, be cautioned: you will be called out and held accountable because Realtors will Stand Up and Deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In today’s challenging environment, it seems OK to do whatever is necessary to get ahead; to make a few more deals, obtain a few more clients, make a few more dollars. Machiavelli said, “the end justifies the means.” But that is not true. What suffers is integrity. What is lost is reputation and trust from the public. Being a Realtor means something special. It’s an honor, a duty, a responsibility. Cooperation and courtesy are the cornerstones of being a Realtor. Without them, the reputation falls away, the confidence is gone. Realtors owe it to themselves and to the association to which they belong to rise, stand tall, identify wrongs, and require all Realtors to abide by the Code we chose to embrace. It’s time to Stand Up and Deliver.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Nov. 22 that more than $81 million has been awarded to support 97 priority projects across New York State through the Regional Economic Development Council initiative.</p>
<p>Among the award recipients include a host of major projects in the Hudson Valley and New York City regions, involving bioscience, downtown revitalization initiatives, the arts and even the development of a Dinosaur Park.</p>

<p>“The pandemic toll touched every corner of the state and every sector of New York&#8217;s economy, and as a result we must ensure that our recovery does the same,” Gov. Hochul said. “As we move forward from the pandemic we are using the rolling grant process to build New York State back better by supporting shovel-ready projects with the potential to accelerate new investments and catalyze economic growth in every community.”</p>
<p>Empire State Development Acting Commissioner and President &amp; CEO-designate Hope Knight said, “The COVID pandemic has had a devastating impact on our state, and this is especially true for the businesses and organizations that are the foundation of our economy. The Regional Economic Development Councils, made up of people who know their own communities best, have recommended innovative projects that will help their regions rebuild, and reemerge stronger and smarter for the future.”</p>
<p>This initial round of priority projects was recommended by each Regional Council because of their project readiness and alignment with each region&#8217;s strategic plan.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>BEDFORD HILLS—At a press conference earlier today (Dec. 6), U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-18) expressed confidence that the reform of the unpopular SALT Cap is at hand.</p>
<p>There have been reports that Senate Democrats are at odds over the particulars of how to reform the SALT Cap, which is to be part of President Biden’s “Build Back Better” social spending package. The House passed the $1.75-trillion spending plan in November that includes a provision to raise the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions to $80,000 through 2030.</p>
<p>Rep. Maloney was joined by local officials, including Westchester County Executive George Latimer and Bedford Supervisor MaryAnn Carr, as well as representatives of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors—former President Leah Caro and Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty—at the press briefing staged at the Bedford Hills Community House.</p>
<p>“I am confident it will pass the Senate,” U.S. Rep. Maloney said. “I think if it gets modified, I think it will be minor modifications.” He later said, “I think we are on the one-yard line here and we are going to punch it into the end zone.”</p>
<p>Rep. Maloney said that the SALT Cap imposed in 2017 under the Trump administration was geared to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and to punish Democratic-leaning states such as New York and California. “It’s been a fight. It has not been easy getting peoples’ local tax deductions, but we have been focused on this like a laser beam and we are going to get it done,” he predicted.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Caro, who is co-chair of the association’s Legislative Committee, said the SALT Cap has suppressed activity among the working and middle class looking to grow or build generational wealth through homeownership. She added that it also deterred younger buyers from purchasing homes in New York State, which Caro noted has contributed “to the brain drain of our great region as other areas and states become more economically appealing” to younger buyers.</p>
<p>“By increasing the cap from $10,000 to $80,000, the pull of owning one’s own home will be restored; providing stability in burgeoning neighborhoods, allowing our young people to stay in the Hudson Valley so we can benefit from their forward thinking and knowledge and keeping New York a place that millions want to call home,” Caro said.</p>
<p>County Executive Latimer said the raising of the SALT Cap will have a beneficial effect on the state and local economies. He said that homeowners will now have more discretionary income to pump back into the local economy that at present is being utilized to pay federal income taxes due to the harsh SALT cap.</p>
<p>He added that the decrease in tax burden will also make homes in Westchester more attractive and affordable to more middle-income buyers.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is any question that this is a home run for local governments and local residents,” Latimer said.</p>
<p>Bedford Supervisor MaryAnn Carr said that the Bedford area has seen a great influx of new families moving into the area. “This particular tax cut is going to mean a lot to this community and the residents of this community,” she said.</p>
<p>Carr said that many Bedford residents are not wealthy and are members of the working class that will greatly benefit from the raising of the SALT Cap.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Billions of dollars will come to New York in rehab, road, bridge, train and tunnel projects. The MTA will also not have to cut service, and can also begin work on future capital projects.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The end of the legislative year in Washington D.C. is at hand and as of this writing Congress passed a landmark infrastructure bill that President Biden signed into law. This was indeed ground-breaking. The country has not had a multi-year infrastructure bill since President George W. Bush signed the bill into law in 2005.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars will come to New York in rehab, road, bridge, train and tunnel projects. The MTA will also not have to cut service, and can also begin work on future capital projects.</p>
<p>The House passed a “Human Infrastructure” bill worth about nearly $2 trillion. So far, the Senate has not yet passed a version of it. This would affect many aspects of American life including Pre-K, child care, Medicare and climate change. Realtors won an increase in the SALT cap that passed in the House version of the social spending bill. Senator Bernie Sanders and several other members of the majority are not supporting any major changes to the SALT cap in the Senate. Some compromises have been offered such as capping SALT at a higher amount, or tying it to income levels. In addition, 1031-like-kind exchanges were not rolled back in the bill. This was a huge victory for Realtors.</p>
<p>At the state level, the governor’s race is now starting to take shape. U.S. Rep. Thomas Suozzi announced that he is running for governor, along with current Gov. Kathy Hochul. Letitia James, the state attorney general, and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams announced they are running too. James has since withdrawn from the race and is running for re-election as Attorney General. On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin announced at the beginning of the year that he would run for governor. Andrew Giuliani announced also, along with former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino.</p>
<p>A host of Congressional candidates have already announced whether or not they are running. One of the key issues to watch out for is which districts the candidates will eventually represent. For the first time in generations Democrats have full control of the redistricting process. This allows them to draw state and congressional district lines for this redistricting cycle which happens once every 10 years. Stay tuned for updates on the candidates running for office in 2022.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It has been over two years, Nov. 17, 2019, since <em>Newsday</em> published its comprehensive and devastating investigative report entitled “Long Island Divided” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3yq9Elz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3yq9Elz</a>]. The article sent shock waves through the entire real estate industry. <em>Newsday</em>’s article became the catalyst that launched a major movement, led by state and local governmental officials and agencies, such as the New York State Department of State Division of Licensing Services and the New York State Division of Human Rights, to combat all forms of discrimination in the real estate industry and to prosecute those licensees found to be violating federal, state and local human rights and anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p><strong>Cases Are Finally Making Their Way Through the System</strong></p>
<p>The DLS (and DHR) quickly began filing complaints and initiating investigations against many of the licensees soon after the <em>Newsday</em> article was published, which continued into early 2020. Among a variety of reasons, including likely delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these cases are just beginning to be resolved. Recent DLS decisions of note issued by Administrative Law Judges include <em>DLS v. Abarca</em> (Nov. 22, 2021) [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3EJZrCu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3EJZrCu</a>]; <em>DLS v. Vicquery</em> (Aug. 30, 2021) [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3IB7OTn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3IB7OTn</a>]; and <em>DLS v. O’Brien</em> (Oct. 22, 2021) [<a href="https://on.ny.gov/3pCo91i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3pCo91i</a>]. These ALJ decisions provide critically important information for real estate licensees when it comes to discriminatory behavior, such as disparate treatment and racial steering, and the legal requirements and duties of the real estate agents with respect to same.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Decisions:</strong> <em>Abarca, O’Brien &amp; Vicquery</em></p>
<p>In <em>Abarca</em>, the ALJ found that the real estate licensee engaged “…in unlawful discriminatory practices proscribed by federal, state or local law” and also decided that the licensee “…engaged in conduct demonstrating untrustworthiness and/or incompetency in violation of Real Property Law (“RPL”) §441-c and 19 NYCRR §175.17 (b).” Based on the evidence provided at the hearing, which consisted primarily of the findings contained in the <em>Newsday</em> article, the ALJ revoked the licensee’s real estate license for engaging in unlawful racial steering and disparate treatment.</p>
<p>In <em>O’Brien and Vicquery</em>, the ALJs reached different conclusions. In both the<em> Vicquery</em> and <em>Abarca</em> decisions, the ALJs held that the evidence presented at the hearings, which came primarily from the <em>Newsday</em> article, did not establish by “substantial evidence” that the agents engaged in illegal steering. However, the ALJ in <em>O’Brien</em> found that the agent mentioning the makeup of the schools and demographics of the area was an act of “incompetence” and the agent was fined $500. In <em>O’Brien</em>, the ALJ did not believe that the agent’s actions rose to the level that warranted suspension or revocation.</p>
<p><strong>Allegations of Racial Steering in<em> Abarca</em></strong></p>
<p>In <em>Abarca</em>, the ALJ, relying on the evidence presented in the <em>Newsday</em> article, explained that the agent provided the minority tester with specific information on the demographic make-up of certain areas and also provided the minority tester with specific information regarding the quality and ratings of the schools. The agent, however, did not do so with the white tester. Instead, the agent provided the white tester with non-specific demographic information and directed the white tester to a website to research information on the quality of schools. Ultimately, the ALJ, relying on the testimony offered by the real estate licensee coupled with the findings in the <em>Newsday</em> report, found that the licensee unlawfully engaged in racial steering.</p>
<p><strong>Disparate Treatment in <em>Abarca</em></strong></p>
<p>In <em>Abarca</em>, the DLS also alleged that the real estate licensee “…engaged in disparate treatment of the minority and white testers by refusing to provide the minority tester with any home tours unless he signed a buyer’s agreement with the respondent and not requiring that the white tester sign a buyer’s agreement.” According to <em>Abaca</em>, “[d]isparate treatment, or adverse treatment, is when a person ‘treats some people less favorably than others because of their membership in a protected class.’”</p>
<p>Again, relying primarily on the evidence presented in the <em>Newsday</em> article, the ALJ found that the agent agreed to show multiple homes to the white tester without requiring the white tester to sign an exclusive buyer agency agreement. However, when it came to the minority tester, the agent refused to show any homes unless he and his wife signed the buyer agency agreement. In addition to the findings presented in the <em>Newsday</em> article, the ALJ found that the licensee’s testimony was not credible, and ultimately determined that the agent acted in an “incompetent and untrustworthy” manner in violation of RPL §441 (b).</p>
<p><strong>Continuing Education Requirements: An Additional Accompanying Charge</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that the DLS has the right to request proof from a licensee, in connection with any complaint that is filed, that the licensee has completed the requisite 22.5 hours of continuing education for any two-year period prior to the agent’s renewal date. In this case, the licensee did not provide the correct proof of continuing education, as some of the courses were for a period after the renewal date.</p>
<p><strong>‘Incompetent’ and ‘Untrustworthy’ Standards Under New York’s RPL</strong></p>
<p>In these cases, the ALJs point out that in order “[t]o qualify for a real estate agent’s license, the respondent must be both trustworthy and competent in order ‘<em>to safeguard the interests of the public</em> [emphasis added].’” [<em>See</em> Real Property Law § 441 (b) at <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3lSMiQb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3lSMiQb</a>]. Often these terms are taken to mean the same thing and are used interchangeably, however, it is important to note that each of these terms have different meanings when it comes to a licensee’s activities.</p>
<p>In <em>O’Brien</em>, the ALJ explains that “‘[u]ntrustworthiness’ involves an act done with ‘bad faith’ [and]…is akin to violation of a professional norm and contemplates such bad faith as would cast doubt on one’s character and fitness to act as a broker [or salesperson].’” The ALJ further explains that an act of “untrustworthiness” involves more than being negligent. On the other hand, the ALJ explains that “‘[i]ncompetence’…is generally understood among the learned professions to involve an act done with a ‘lack of skill or knowledge necessary to practice the profession.” These concepts are evaluated on a case by case basis, as is evident in these recent decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination Prohibited: Presumed to Be Untrustworthiness and a Violation Of the NAR Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Section 175.17 (b) of the Department of State’s Regulations provides that “No real estate broker or salesperson shall engage in an unlawful discriminatory practice, as proscribed by any federal, state or local law applicable to the activities of real estate licensees in New York State.” In the event a licensee is found to have engaged in unlawful discrimination, such behavior “…shall be presumptive evidence of untrustworthiness and will subject such licensee to discipline, including a proceeding for revocation.” Under Section 441-c of the RPL, the Department of State may revoke or suspend a licensee’s license, or may issue a fine up to $1,000.</p>
<p>The ALJ in <em>O’Brien</em> also points out that acts of “untrustworthiness” are violations of the National Association of Realtors’ Code of Ethics, particularly Article 10. Citing an article published by NAR, the ALJ points out that “…if an agent expresses his or her own positive or negative views about certain communities or schools, the purpose of which is to direct a buyer either towards or away from a community, then that agent may be stating a housing preference based on race or familial status or religion. These would be violations of the Fair Housing Act and of the Realtors Code of Ethics.”</p>
<p><strong>The Burden of Proof is on the DLS: Substantial Evidence Standard</strong></p>
<p>Since it is the DLS that files a complaint, the burden is on the DLS to prove, by substantial evidence, the charges set forth in the complaint. The ALJ in <em>Abarca</em> explains that “[s]ubstantial evidence ‘means such relevant proof as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion or ultimate fact… [m]ore than seeming or imaginary, it is less than a preponderance of the evidence, overwhelming evidence or evidence beyond a reasonable doubt….”</p>
<p>In <em>O’Brien</em>, the ALJ further explains that substantial evidence is “…evidence that has ‘such quality and quantity as to generate conviction in and persuade a fair and detached fact finder that…a conclusion or ultimate fact may be extracted reasonably, probatively and logically.’ ‘Substantial evidence does not rise from bare surmise, conjecture, speculation or rumor.’[See <em>Geisler v. State</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3rUpwLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3rUpwLI</a>]”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Newsday</em> Article: Hearsay Evidence is Admissible but is More Needed?</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Abarca</em>, the DLS’s evidence consisted primarily of the <em>Newsday</em> article and the videos. The ALJ explained that although the <em>Newsday</em> article contained “hearsay” evidence, “[i]t is well established that hearsay evidence is permitted in an administrative proceeding and, under certain circumstances, may constitute an agency’s entire case.” The ALJ, however, pointed out that hearsay evidence must be relevant, probative, and reliable. Relying on the evidence presented in the <em>Newsday</em> article, such as a specific timeline of events, voicemails, evidence relating to the agent not showing homes to the minority tester, evidence relating to the agent requiring that the minority tester sign a buyer agency agreement before showing a home and not requiring the white tester to do the same, the ALJ held that all of this evidence “…is not only relevant, but it is probative as it relates to the issue of disparate treatment and is reliable as it is corroborated by sworn testimony and documentary evidence presented at the hearing.” Ultimately, the ALJ found that the substantial evidence existed warranting revocation of the agent’s license.</p>
<p>In contrast, the ALJs in both the <em>O’Brien</em> and <em>Vicquery</em> cases found that while the evidence presented in the<em> Newsday</em> article was enough to allow the DLS to file the initial complaint, the DLS failed to proffer “substantial” evidence at the hearing. In <em>O’Brien</em>, the ALJ indicated that the DLS relied solely on the newspaper’s findings without submitting additional corroborating evidence from a more reliable source. The ALJ wrote, “[t]he newspaper is neither a government document nor such other document typical rules of evidence, even flexible ones, customarily find reliable. For sure, reliance on the newspaper article was sufficient at the pleading stage, it was not however at the hearing stage.”</p>
<p>In the <em>Vicquery</em> decision, the ALJ points out that while the <em>Newsday</em> article contained “…hearsay statements claiming the respondent and Ms. Gillin provided particular listings to the testers…the listings themselves were never introduced and the testers, who have actual knowledge of the listings, were not called to testify.” The actual testers were also not interviewed as part of DLS investigation. Therefore, relying solely on the hearsay evidence presented in the <em>Newsday</em> report is not sufficient and does not satisfy the “substantial evidence” standard.</p>
<p><strong>What More Can We Expect?</strong></p>
<p>The cases are slowly but surely making their way through the system and it is important to keep a close eye on all of the DLS decisions as they are issued. These decisions and investigations will not only affect the licensees targeted in the <em>Newsday</em> investigation, but will certainly affect all licensees. As is evident from these recent decisions, the outcomes of each case will be very fact specific. One important issue to keep in mind is that having legal counsel represent a licensee in connection with any hearing is recommended. In many of these decisions, when a licensee elects not to be represented by counsel, the decision is not favorable for the respondent.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEW YORK—The Penn Station Access Project, which has been widely supported by politicians and business interests in the Bronx and Westchester has reached a critical stage—the award of a contract to undertake the work that will provide direct Metro-North service from the Bronx, Westchester and Connecticut to Penn Station and Manhattan’s west side.</p>
<p>Penn Station Access will, when completed, drastically reduce travel times for people who live and work in the East Bronx, an area currently without any rail service. The current project construction schedule is estimated at 63 months and $2.87 billion. It is estimated the project will create or retain approximately 4,500 direct jobs and another 10,000 indirect jobs.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Dec. 15 that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had approved a design-build contract for the Penn Station Access Project to Halmar International, LLC/RailWorks, J.V.</p>
<p>“Metro-North is coming to the east Bronx, and bringing faster commutes with it,” said Governor Hochul. “This one project by itself is a big step forward for environmental justice, environmentally sustainable transportation, the Bronx economy and regional interconnectivity, and yet another example of our ongoing efforts to make sure that all New Yorkers have the modernized transportation systems they deserve.”</p>
<p>Janno Lieber, MTA Acting Chair and CEO said, “This is a great news for the Bronx and the region. With four new ADA-accessible stations in Co-Op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest and Hunts Point, Penn Station Access will deliver access to jobs, education and opportunity for those underserved neighborhoods, cutting commutes to the Manhattan Central Business District, but also introducing reverse commuting opportunities.”</p>
<p>There are almost 250,000 residents and more than 100,000 jobs within a half mile of the four stations, which can have service as frequent as every 20 minutes in the peak period. The new service will save East Bronx riders up to approximately 50 minutes in each direction to Penn Station, and up to 75 minutes in each direction to Connecticut. Current New Haven Line riders with destinations on the west side will save up to 40 minutes per day since travel from Grand Central will not be necessary.</p>
<p>Catherine Rinaldi, President of MTA Metro-North Railroad said, “Access to Penn Station is completely transformative for Metro-North and we are excited to begin the service upon completion of the project. This will be the railroad’s largest expansion in history – four new stations is no small thing. This gives Metro-North’s busiest line a second route into Manhattan for the first time, redundancy that’s all the more important as the railroad looks to pursue major capital renewal projects on the route to Grand Central – namely the Park Avenue Viaduct and the Park Avenue Tunnel.”</p>
<p>The project will improve regional transportation connectivity, enhance network resiliency by providing a second Metro-North terminal in Manhattan, promote sustainability and bridge communities. By using Amtrak’s existing Hell Gate Line, the project will maximize the potential of existing infrastructure, while minimizing impacts on the community.</p>
<p>It will also bring the Hell Gate Line into a state of good repair and improve reliability and on-time performance for intercity passengers and prepare the corridor for high speed rail in the future. Amtrak will contribute $500 million toward the project, thanks to the efforts of Majority Leader Schumer. Amtrak has also agreed to pay the costs of delay if they fail to meet commitments to provide outages or workforce.</p>
<p>U.S Senator Chuck Schumer said, “This week, I was proud to announce a deal that I brokered between Amtrak and MTA to advance two projects critical to the future of transit in New York: Metro-North Penn Access and the East River Tunnel rehabilitation project. Today, MTA’s Board ratified that deal and awarded a contract for construction of Penn Access. This is a watershed moment for transit-starved communities in the East and South Bronx – and the Sound Shore communities of Westchester – as it will connect these communities with quick, reliable, one-seat commuter rail service into Midtown Manhattan and job centers in Westchester and Connecticut. I applaud the MTA Board for awarding the contract and look forward to continuing to push both projects as priorities for USDOT grants.”</p>
<p>Bronx Borough President Diaz Jr. said, &#8220;This is welcoming news and a tremendous step forward for the residents of The Bronx. For about a decade, I have been beating the drum on direct access to Penn Station from The Bronx, and now, this game-changing project is even closer to becoming a reality. Penn Station Access will help countless Bronxites with more efficient commutes, which will also open up job possibilities, while reducing congestion on our roads. I want to thank Janno Lieber, MTA Acting Chair and CEO and the entire MTA team for moving this project forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer said, “This vital step in the Penn Station Access project’s timeline is a win for Westchester’s residents who live along the Sound Shore. The creation a one-seat ride into Penn Station, opening up greater access to jobs, education and health care for the first time ever, will improve commutes and raise Westchester home values in the process. I am appreciative of the efforts of MTA and all stakeholders on this project and we cannot wait to see it come to fruition.”</p>
<p>Council Member and Bronx Borough President-elect Vanessa L. Gibson said, “The East Bronx has for a long time been at a disadvantage when it comes to transportation access, but this new plan put forth by the MTA and funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill will help reduce the transit divide in our borough. The Metro-North expansion in the Bronx will also be a game changer with economic development opportunities and infrastructure investments that are sorely needed as we attempt to recover from the devastating impact COVID-19 has had on our borough. I want to thank MTA, Majority Leader Charles Schumer, the New York Congressional Delegation, and all of our transit advocates for their support of this initiative and transit equity for all New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>In addition to the four new stations, the project will turn the existing two-track railroad into a largely four-track railroad, with over 19 miles of new and rehabilitated track work. The project also includes four bridge rehabilitations, the reconfiguration of Metro-North&#8217;s New Rochelle Yard, four new and one reconfigured interlockings, five new and two upgraded substations, and the modernization of signal, power and communication infrastructure.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NEWBURGH—The consensus from a panel of veteran New York Realtors is that while some headwinds exist for the housing market in 2022, conditions are favorable for continued strong sales and rising prices. One panelist said that despite a slowdown in sales, “there is still a lot of meat on the bone” in the current strong seller’s home sales market in the New York metro region.</p>
<p>The Pattern for Progress Center for Housing Solutions, which is based in Newburgh, held a virtual panel discussion on Nov. 30 entitled “Housing Update | The Housing Market Outlook for 2022,” which featured David Legaz, President of the New York State Association of Realtors, Leah Caro, Principal and President at Park Sterling Realty, and Joseph Rand, Chief Creative Officer at Howard Hanna | Rand Realty and Executive Director for Broker Public Portal. The session was moderated by Joe Czajka, director of the Center for Housing Solutions.</p>
<p>NYSAR’s Legaz noted that national home sales in October were very strong with 82% of the homes sold were on the market for less than a month. Demand for single-family rentals was also robust with asking rents rising due to low inventory on the for-sale side. Sales of new single-family homes hit a six-month high, he added. Legaz noted that single-family home sales in New York State after having risen for 13 straight months, have fallen the previous two months. As of October 2021, year-over-year sales in New York State fell approximately 10% as compared to the super-charged pandemic-induced sales volume registered in 2020. New listings fell during the 2020-2021 period 15.9%, median sale prices rose 10% to $370,000 statewide and inventory fell 23.1%.</p>
<p>Caro and Rand pointed to the possible reform of the SALT Cap as a positive for the market in 2022. She noted that the House of Representatives recently approved the Biden Administration’s Build Back Better Bill which would raise the SALT Cap from its current $10,000 to $80,000 through 2030.</p>
<p>If passed by the Senate, Caro said, “It would be a huge win” for New York State and other impacted states.</p>
<p>While predicting that 2022 will continue to be a strong market, Caro did point out some issues that could put some downward pressure on activity.</p>
<p>Caro said rising inflation is giving her some pause when looking out into the future, especially in light of New York State’s high property taxes and home prices and consumer products.</p>
<p>Those increased costs “makes me wonder if folks might not take a step back and see where inflation goes in 2022 or maybe put their plans on hold, I hope not, but I think that is something we might see.”</p>
<p>She also noted that due to low inventory, some people who wish to stay in the area may not put their homes on the market due to limited options and high prices.</p>
<p>“I understand that in some of the more northern counties that locals are really being priced out of their own towns because you have this influx from the boroughs and the city who are driving prices up,” she added.</p>
<p>Rand said that the increase in the SALT Cap will help wealthy Manhattan homeowners as well as those in Westchester County. He theorized that the New York suburban markets adjusted to the impacts of the SALT Cap since 2017. He added that if the cap is raised, it would have a moderate impact on the local markets.</p>
<p>Rand in his statistical presentation, stressed that while third quarter sales activity in the lower Hudson Valley was down from the “tidal wave” of sales volume in 2020, when compared with the 2019 “normal, but growing seller’s” market, listings were up, pending sales were almost 20% higher and closings were up almost 33%.</p>
<p>In his analysis, Rand noted that new listings are just not keeping up with the demand, prompting him to say, “We are not getting enough fuel for the fire so that is pushing some of the pricing (higher). It is also just making it a tough time to buy a house.”</p>
<p><strong>2022 Predictions</strong></p>
<p>Caro believes the housing market will continue to be dogged by low inventory, although levels will increase somewhat in 2022.</p>
<p>She thinks buyers will continue to come out of the city and buy homes in the Hudson Valley, but at a slower pace than 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>“I am not a pessimist so I am hoping that supply chain and inflation (issues) are short term because I think if that is long term we will have downward pressure (on home sales),” Caro said.</p>
<p>Legaz said that if New York State “continues to overreach and de-incentivize homeownership, we are going to see more people leave New York State” because in part “our children can’t afford to live here.”</p>
<p>Rand said that he is a believer in economic cycles and thinks that the region’s real estate market is in the latter third of the seller’s market.</p>
<p>“I think we have a couple of years left (of the seller’s market),” Rand said. “Unless we have an interest rate spike that might affect things, COVID rebounds… I think the market will continue to grow.”</p>
<p>He continued that sales will be above 2019 levels through the end of 2022 and expects inventory to increase as prices continue to rise. Rand noted that prices have only now come back to levels seen at the height of the previous seller’s market in 2005.</p>
<p>“It’s taken 16 years to get us back to the prices of the last seller’s market, so I think there is still a lot of meat on that bone,” Rand said.</p>
<p>He concluded his remarks by saying that in response to those who criticize New York for its high taxes and costs, “You get what you pay for. This is a great place to live,” pointing out the Empire State’s fine restaurants, entertainment, parks, rivers etc. “You pay more to live in a place that is as wonderful as New York State, with all its flaws.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—As part of the National Association of Realtors’ Real Estate Forecast Summit held on Dec. 15, real estate economists and experts predict a continued strong market, marginal improvement in the nation’s for-sale inventory crisis and higher interest rates.</p>
<p>The virtual program began with an opening address by 2022 NAR President Leslie Rouda Smith, followed by a keynote address by Todd M. Richardson, general deputy assistant secretary for policy development and research at HUD; an economic outlook by NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun and a Housing Outlook panel that featured: Ken H. Johnson, Associate Dean of Graduate Programs, Florida Atlantic University; Lesli Gooch, Ph.D., CEO, Manufactured Housing Institute; Naa Awaa Tagoe, Acting Deputy Director, Division of Housing Mission and Goals for the Federal Housing Finance Agency; and Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com.</p>
<p>NAR President Smith said that the association believes that interest rates will rise in 2022 and that inventory levels will begin to increase next year as well. Later that morning, a majority of members of the Federal Reserve indicated the Fed would likely increase short-term lending rates three times next year, possibly beginning in the spring.</p>
<p>Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors, revealed that NAR believes that when all home sales close at the end of December, 2021 sales will be at the highest level since 2006. <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/news/five-questions-with-nar-chief-economist-lawrence-yun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Yun is the subject of this month’s Five Questions With feature</a>.</p>
<p>Realtor.com Chief Economist Hale outlined a host of predictions for 2022. She said that there is concern about inventory levels. “One of the things that we are optimistic about in our forecast is that there is not going to be a huge change, but we do expect that inventory will bottom out and start to increase into 2022,” she said.</p>
<p>Hale added that Realtor.com sees strong buyer demand boosting home sales in 2022. Sales will be spurred in future years by the 45 million people in the 26-35 age group who will be looking to form families in coming years. Realtor.com expects the median home sale price to rise by 2.9%; existing home sales to be 6.6% higher, for sale inventory to increase slightly by 0.3% and mortgage rates to average 3.3% for the year and be at 3.6% at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Other trends Hale sees in 2022:</p>
<p>• Home sales to reach 16-year highs.</p>
<p>• Home prices to increase but at a more moderate pace.</p>
<p>• Apartment rents will outpace home price growth.</p>
<p>• Home buyers will continue to prefer the suburbs.</p>
<p>• Hispanic buyers will continue to be a growing demographic.</p>
<p>In her 2022 forecast posted at Realtor.com, Hale noted, “while urban areas continue to be pricier and fast-paced, the advantage of shifting to the suburbs to get a better bang for the buck and face a less competitive market has eroded. Nevertheless, with affordability likely to be even more top of mind for buyers in the face of rising home prices and rising mortgage rates, the suburbs are likely to maintain their recent cachet.”</p>
<p>Hale noted that 2022 will continue to be a seller’s market. “Homebuyers have much to look forward to in 2022. After years of declining, the inventory of homes for sale is finally expected to rebound from all-time lows. Still, the housing market will remain competitive for buyers, particularly for those looking for homes in entry-level price tiers,” she stated in her online forecast.</p>
<p>She also noted that with market conditions as they are, first-time homebuyers face an uphill journey in many markets. “First-time homebuyers will need to be successful in the 2022 housing market if we are going to see the homeownership rate begin to climb again,” Hale said. “In many respects it will be an uphill journey given the slightly better but still-limited for-sale inventory environment, high and rising prices, and rising mortgage rates all pushing monthly costs higher.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Gov. Hochul Signs Bill Package to Combat Housing Discrimination in Response to Newsday’s Expose]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a legislative package on Dec. 21 totaling nine bills geared at combating housing discrimination and addressing issues raised in a <em>Newsday</em> expose entitled “Long Island Divided.”</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the legislation is the Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund that will permit the state to conduct fair housing testing. Other initiatives included in the bills signed into law range from increasing training and raising the maximum fines for misconduct by real estate brokers and salespersons, to emphasizing that all state and local agencies that administer state housing programs have an obligation to “affirmatively further fair housing.” These new bills, spearheaded by Senate Housing Committee Chair Brian Kavanagh and Assembly Housing Committee Chair Steven Cymbrowitz, will ensure the real estate workforce is well versed in fair housing practices and that the new fund is sufficiently resourced to carry out its intended purpose, New York State officials said.</p>
<p>The <em>Newsday</em> expose published in November 2019 was the culmination of a three-year investigation that uncovered widespread evidence of unequal treatment by real estate agents on Long Island and both explicit and implicit bias that exists in the real estate industry. The expose led to State Senate hearings and some disciplinary actions taken against some of the agents identified in the series.</p>
<p>“For too long, the dream of owning a home has been out of reach for too many New Yorkers because of discrimination and bigotry,” said Gov. Hochul. “When intrepid investigative journalists uncovered housing discrimination in New York, we took action to end this unacceptable practice. I&#8217;m proud to sign strong new laws expanding access to fair housing and allowing more New Yorkers to achieve the American dream of owning their homes.”</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, the New York State Association of Realtors stated in response to the housing discrimination bills signed into law: “The New York State Association of Realtors, Inc. (NYSAR) was proud to have worked with state lawmakers over the last two years to strengthen fair housing laws in New York State. We commend Governor Hochul and the State Legislature for their actions and their willingness to work with Realtors and other industry partners toward reasonable solutions that enhance fair housing education for all real estate licensees and increase penalties for bad actors who violate the law. There is no place for illegal discrimination, whether it be in housing or elsewhere. The New York State Association of Realtors Inc. is committed to educating our members about these new laws and regulations and will promote strict compliance.”</p>
<p>NYSAR also noted, “Realtors have a long history of opposing illegal housing discrimination and have consistently sought constructive fair housing solutions. We look forward to continuing to work with Governor Hochul and state lawmakers on additional fair housing initiatives to the benefit of all residents of New York State.”</p>
<p>The following is a rundown of the new housing discrimination legislation signed into law by the governor.</p>
<p><strong>Creation of the Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Legislation (S.945-B/A.6866) establishes an Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund, a portion of which will be supported by fines collected for violations of anti-discrimination sections of the real property law. This bill increases the fine ceiling from $1,000 to $2,000 and then diverts 50% of the revenue from these fines to the Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund. This fund will be available to the Office of the Attorney General for fair housing testing which will allocate grants to various government and non-governmental entities specializing in anti-housing discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing Fines and Adding a Surcharge to Licensing Fees</strong></p>
<p>Legislation (S.2133-A/A.5363) adds a surcharge to licensing and re-licensing fees for real estate brokers and salespersons to be used for statewide fair housing efforts. The surcharge, an additional $30 for brokers and an additional $10 for salespersons, will be deposited into the Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund for fair housing testing efforts.</p>
<p>State Senator James Skoufis said, “Following <em>Newsday</em>&#8216;s 2019 exposé on housing discrimination, my colleagues and I opened a year-long investigation into predatory practices in real estate. We held multiple joint hearings, issued 25 subpoenas to compel uncooperative Realtors and their firms to testify, and ultimately produced a wide-ranging investigative report with many legislative recommendations to tighten regulation of this often abusive industry. By signing this package of fair housing bills, Governor Hochul is sending a clear message to housing interests across New York that all homebuyers deserve to be treated with dignity and fairness.”</p>
<p><strong>State and Local Agencies Have an Obligation to Fair Housing </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Legislation (S.1353-A/A.5428-A) requires all state and local agencies administering housing programs or enforcing housing laws that receive state funding to affirmatively further fair housing. Agencies must take meaningful steps to further fair housing. Pursuant to an agreement with the legislature, the Commissioner must report significant steps taken to in line with this obligation every five years, with interim reporting in year two and year four.</p>
<p><strong>Increases Required Fair Housing Training for Real Estate Professionals </strong></p>
<p>Legislation (S.2132-B/A.5359) increases required trainings for real estate professionals, particularly trainings related to fair housing. Trainings are required to include, but are not limited to courses on:</p>
<p>• The legacy of segregation, unequal treatment, and historic lack of access to housing opportunities;</p>
<p>• Unequal access to amenities and resources on the basis of race, disability and other protected characteristics;</p>
<p>• Federal, state, and local fair housing laws and</p>
<p>•Anti-bias training.</p>
<p>The bill is designed to prevent the unequal treatment of minority homebuyers by increasing overall instructional training as well as instructional training pertaining to fair housing and discrimination in the real estate industry.</p>
<p><strong>Requires Implicit Bias Training for Real Estate Brokers or Salespersons</strong></p>
<p>Legislation (S.538-B/S.4638-A) requires an additional two hours of training relating to implicit bias for real estate brokers and salespersons as part of their license renewal process. During investigations into the issues brought to light by “Long Island Divided,” it became apparent that many real estate professionals were unaware of the impact implicit bias could have in their industry, state officials said. The bill ensures that all real estate professionals are made aware of how harmful implicit bias can be and how to ensure they follow fair housing guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Requires Cultural Competency Training for Real Estate Brokers or Salespersons  </strong></p>
<p>Legislation (S.979-A/A.844-A) requires that coursework on cultural competency be included in the curriculum for real estate broker and salesperson license qualification, and requires an additional two hours of training for real estate professionals in comprehensive cultural competency prior to renewing broker or salesperson licenses. This will help decrease discrimination in the real estate industry, and further educate real estate professionals to ensure they follow fair housing practices.</p>
<p><strong>Requiring Standardized Intake Procedures for Real Estate Professionals</strong></p>
<p>Legislation (S.2131-A/A.6186) requires standardized client intake procedures for real estate brokers and allows for a penalty to be imposed on any real estate broker or salesperson who fails to comply. Pursuant to an agreement with the legislature, real estate professionals must post and maintain their standardized operating procedures at their offices for inspection by the Department of State and the public. The bill allows for client intake procedures to be monitored and standardized, preventing discriminatory practices.</p>
<p><strong>Requires Associate Brokers Serving as Office Managers to Supervise Other Real Estate Professionals </strong></p>
<p>Legislation (S.2157-A/A.6355) requires associate real estate brokers who serve as office mangers to supervise other real estate professionals in their office. Office managers must have been active in the real estate industry two of the four years before beginning duties as office manager. Real estate brokers are responsible for maintaining and supervising their place of business, unlike associate brokers who have the same licensing but have chosen to work under the supervision of another broker. The legislation clarifies the required level of supervision and strengthens existing Department of State regulations. In addition, the legislation specifies the length of time an associate broker is required to work prior to becoming an office manager and will therefore ensure offices are appropriately supervised by experienced real estate professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Telephone Line for Housing Discrimination Complaints </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Legislation (S.3437-C/A.2300-C) establishes a dedicated telephone line for housing discrimination complaints. This telephone line will be run by the Division of Human Rights and will provide assistance to those experiencing housing discrimination. This will create a more efficient process for reporting incidents of housing discrimination.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Existing U.S. Home Sales Rose 1.9% in November; Northeast Sales Flat Compared to October Volume]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing U.S. home sales rose in November, denoting three consecutive months of increases, according to the National Association of Realtors. Three of the four major U.S. regions reported growth in monthly sales, while the fourth region—the Northeast—held steady in November. From a year-over-year perspective, only one region experienced a rise in sales as the three others saw home sales decline.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast were flat compared to the prior month, neither climbing or falling in November, and recorded an annual rate of 760,000, which was an 11.6% decrease from November 2020. The median price in the Northeast was $372,500, up 4.7% from one year ago, according to the NAR report released on Dec. 22.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, grew 1.9% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.46 million in November. Sales fell 2.0% from a year ago (6.59 million in November 2020).</p>
<p>“Determined buyers were able to land housing before mortgage rates rise further in the coming months,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Locking in a constant and firm mortgage payment motivated many consumers who grew weary of escalating rents over the last year.”</p>
<p>He continued, “Mortgage rates are projected to jump in 2022, however, I don’t expect the imminent increase to be overly dramatic.”</p>
<p>Yun forecasts the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to average at 3.7% by year-end of 2022.</p>
<p>Total housing inventory at the end of November amounted to 1.11 million units, down 9.8% from October and down 13.3% from one year ago (1.28 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.1-month supply at the current sales pace, a decline from both the prior month and from one year ago.</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in November was $353,900, up 13.9% from November 2020 ($310,800), as prices increased in each region, with the highest pace of appreciation in the South region. This marks 117 straight months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.</p>
<p>“Supply-chain disruptions for building new homes and labor shortages have hindered bringing more inventory to the market,” said Yun. “Therefore, housing prices continue to march higher due to the near record-low supply levels.”</p>
<p>Yun noted that inflation and the pace of price appreciation is expected to subside next year. Last week, NAR held its third annual Real Estate Forecast Summit, featuring economists and housing experts whose consensus found inflation would likely ease in 2022 at a 4% rate, while home prices are expected to rise at a moderate pace of 5.7%.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 18 days in November, equal to October and down from 21 days in November 2020. Eighty-three percent of homes sold in November 2021 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 26% of sales in November, down from 29% in October and from 32% in November 2020. NAR’s 2021 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released last month—reported that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 15% of homes in November, down from 17% in October and up from 14% in November 2020. All-cash sales accounted for 24% of transactions in November, equal to October’s percentage, and up from 20% from November 2020.</p>
<p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in November, equal to the percentage seen a month prior and equal to November 2020.</p>
<p>According to realtor.com’s Market Trends Report, the markets seeing the largest year-over-year growth in newly listed homes include Milwaukee (+17.4%), Charlotte (+16.1%) and Buffalo (+13.5%). Markets still seeing a decline in newly listed homes compared to last year are Hartford (-20.2%), San Francisco (-19.1%), and San Jose (-16.2%).</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.07 in November, equal to October’s rate. The average commitment rate across all of 2020 was 3.11%.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.75 million in November, up 1.6% from 5.66 million in October and down 2.2% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $362,600 in November, up 14.9% from November 2020.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 710,000 units in November, up 4.4% from 680,000 in October and equal to one year ago. The median existing condo price was $283,200 in November, an annual increase of 4.4%.</p>
<p>“As the year comes to an end, NAR is very proud of the work we’ve done to protect homeownership and the valuable investments made in our communities and infrastructure,” said NAR President Leslie Rouda Smith, a Realtor from Plano, TX, and a broker associate at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate in Dallas. “We recognize that further efforts are needed and will continue to promote Fair Housing, work to increase the housing shortage and fight to dismantle discriminatory housing laws and outdated policies.”</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Midwest ticked up 0.7% to an annual rate of 1,520,000 in November, a 0.7% drop from a year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $260,100, a 9.0% jump from November 2020.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South grew 2.9% in November, registering an annual rate of 2,850,000, a rise of 1.1% from one year ago. The median price in the South was $318,900, an 18.4% surge from one year prior.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West increased 2.3%, reaching an annual rate of 1,330,000 in November, down 3.6% from one year ago. The median price in the West was $507,200, up 8.4% from November 2020.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Residential sales in 2021 in the counties served by OneKey MLS, Inc. reached a historic peak. This, despite a slowing of sales in the fourth quarter in all areas served by OneKey MLS with the exception of Bronx County.</p>
<p>Arguably, some of the slowdown can be attributed to the dearth of inventory in the counties north of New York City, while the “Bronx Tale” is more closely aligned to a return of buyers to the New York City market.</p>
<p>While the view of the market in terms of units sold and dollar volume is a positive one, it was a frustrating arena for many buyers who lost homes to higher bidders and for the practitioners dealing with client frustration and disappointment.</p>
<p>Bronx County had the largest percentage increase in residential sales at 61.4% year-over-year with 2,553 units sold as compared to 1,582 sales for 2020. Total residential sales in the counties to the north were more in line with each other with Rockland County leading the group with an increase of 19.3% (3,631 units compared to 3,044 units in 2020); Westchester, a close second at 19.1% (11,855 units compared to 9,955 units for 2020); followed by Orange County with a 16% increase (5,406 residential sales compared to 4,662 sales in 2020); Putnam experienced a 10.6% increase over 2020 (1,605 units compared to 1,451) and Sullivan County had a 9.6% increase for 2021 (1,393 compared to 1,271 in 2020).</p>
<p>Sales of single-family residential units increased across the board with Bronx County sales increasing an eye-opening 45.8% (716 units vs. 491 units for 2020). The median price of a single-family residence in Bronx County increased 8.5% to $575,000. The largest percentage price increase for a single-family home occurred in Sullivan County with a 25.3% increase to $244,400 from $195,000 in 2020. Notably, Westchester County, with the highest prices in the region, had the smallest percentage increase in median price for the year at 6.1% ($780,000 as compared to $735,000 in 2020) and actually experienced a slight decrease (-0.8%) in median price for the fourth quarter. This may be indicative of price increases beginning to moderate.</p>
<p>Orange County has seen consistent increases in the single-family median price with a year-over-year increase of 16.5% ($367,000 compared to $315,000 in 2020). Orange County single-family home sales increased by 11.2 % for the year to 4,444 units (compared to 3,996 in 2020) despite a drop of 20.7% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In Rockland County the single-family median sale price increased 12% to $560,000 (from $500,00 in 2020) and Putnam County saw its single-family median price rise 15.8% to $440,000 (from $380,000 in 2020).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-39439" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-County-Total-Resdential-Sales-4th-Quarter.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="462" />In terms of percentages, condominium, multi-family (2-4 family), and in Westchester County, co-op sales as well, all outpaced the increases in single-family units and, in most instances, the percent of median price increase. In Westchester County, where co-op sales lagged in 2020, they increased 36.3% to 2,129 units (from 1,562 in 2020). Affordability is the most prevalent reason for these choices particularly in view of the price increases in single-family dwellings. For many suburban purchasers, condos and co-ops represent a means to build equity to purchase a single-family residence.</p>
<p>When focusing solely on the fourth quarter residential sales numbers, they reflect a return to the more typical seasonality in the market, which disappeared in the fourth quarter of 2021. While there were significant decreases in the number of residential sales in all counties, except the Bronx, when comparing the 2021 fourth quarter to the 2020 fourth quarter sales, it is important to remember that the fourth quarter 2020 sales were fueled by a surge in buying activity in the second half of 2020 once COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. A more realistic comparison would be to the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, and the 2021 fourth quarter residential sales numbers were significantly higher than either of those two years.</p>
<p>Indicators such as days on market were down significantly in all market areas. Homes selling close to or at list price and above list price were a relatively common event. Lack of inventory continues to be a problem with no meaningful resolution on the near horizon. With the Fed tightening monetary policy it is expected that mortgage rates will begin a steady rise in 2022. However, despite these headwinds, the real estate market in the New York City and greater suburban area, including the lower Hudson Valley, have shown remarkable resiliency in the last year and a half, and we expect a strong real estate market to continue into 2022.</p>
<p>With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, the real estate market has been an anomaly outperforming the economy. Sales and prices have enjoyed a trajectory which is likely unsustainable going forward, however the economy of the Hudson Valley continues to improve and grow more vibrant, which bodes well for real estate. It is likely that price increases will moderate and additional product will come on the market, which will sustain a strong market in the near term.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Happy New Year!! I hope this month’s article finds everyone well and reenergized for 2022. As we return to work in this new year, I thought I would use this article to provide a refresher of the latest-and-greatest of the changes that are impacting your real estate activities. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>State of Emergency Executive Order and Cold Calling</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous State of Emergency Executive Orders that are still active. One such Order is based on the current gun violence in New York State and it is effective “until further notice.” While this Order is wholly unrelated to real estate activities it, like all other State of Emergency Orders, requires that real estate licensees refrain from making any cold calls. This means that Realtors may not make unsolicited calls to any member of the public regarding the sale of their home unless they already have a developed relationship with them. A Realtor can call a For Sale by Owner (FSBO) only if they have a potential buyer. They cannot contact the FSBO in order to try to solicit the listing. However, all other types of marketing are permitted (mailers, billboards, social media, Internet, etc.).</p>
<p>I have been made aware of many agents that are ignoring the Orders and they continue to cold call. Such agents are forewarned that in doing so, you are breaking the law. Such an action is criminal and, if forwarded to the Dept. of State, Licensing Division, could result in your license being suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>On a positive note, just last week, at the prompting of NYSAR, a bill was introduced in the legislature to try to sever the cold calling provision from the State of Emergency Orders. We will keep you posted as this develops.</p>
<p><strong>New Bills to Curb Housing Discrimination Signed by Governor Hochul</strong></p>
<p>In late December, Governor Hochul signed numerous bills designed to combat housing discrimination. They were signed with the caveat that portions of the bills would be revised with technical amendments. These amendments will be completed sometime this year. Therefore, many of these changes will not take effect immediately and I have noted the effective dates where applicable. However, all Realtors should be aware of these impending changes.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Licensing Instruction</strong></p>
<p>For brokers: the licensing requirement will go from 120 hours of instruction to 152 hours of instruction. Included in that increase is 30 hours of broker and 2 hours of fair housing instruction.</p>
<p>For salespersons: the licensing requirement will go from 75 hours to 77 hours of instruction. The increase will include 2 additional hours of fair housing instruction (for a total of 6 hours).</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective as of Dec. 21, 2022.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Office Manager Requirement</strong></p>
<p>Office managers will be required to have at least 2 years of experience as an associate broker before they will be permitted to serve as an office manager.</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Increased Continuing Education Requirement</strong></p>
<p>An additional 2 hours of implicit bias and 2 hours of cultural competency training will be required as part of the overall 22.5 hours of required CE education.</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective Sept. 21, 2022.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Implementation of Standard Operating Procedures</strong></p>
<p>The DOS will develop regulations requiring brokerages to institute standard operating procedures and submit them to the DOS, where the DOS will maintain these records. Currently, it is unknown as to what these standard operating procedures will be, but it is contemplated that such regulations may include requirements concerning identification, exclusive agreement usage, financing, pre-approvals, etc. In addition to submitting these procedures to the DOS, brokerages will be required to post them on their websites and mobile apps, as well as make them available to the public at their office.</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective April 20, 2022</strong>; however, due to the fact that it will still need to go through the regulatory approval process, it is anticipated that the effective date will be some time later in the year.</p>
<p><strong>Increase in Licensing Fees</strong></p>
<p>Salesperson: $10 surcharge<br />
Broker: $30 surcharge</p>
<p>The surcharged amounts will be directed to support fair housing testing.</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective Jan. 20, 2022.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Increase in Fines</strong></p>
<p>Maximum fines that can be imposed by the DOS will increase from $1,000 to $2,000. Additionally, the New York State Attorney General’s Office will create an “Anti-Discrimination in Housing” fund and 50% of all the fines will be directed to this new fund.</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective Jan. 20, 2022</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>New Hotline</strong></p>
<p>The bill directs the Division of Human Rights to establish a hotline for registering housing discrimination complaints.</p>
<p><strong>This regulation is effective April 20, 2022</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>HERO Act Still in Effect</strong></p>
<p>The HERO Act requires employers to take steps to ensure the health and safety of employees and public. This act creates similar requirements that Phase 2 of the previously expired Executive Order relating to COVID-19 precautions. Such activities as mask, limited contact, wiping down surfaces, spacing, etc. are still required and must be implemented at open houses and all showings.</p>
<p><strong>NY Mask Mandate</strong></p>
<p>Unless an organization has a vaccine mandate in place, all persons over the age of 2 who can medically tolerate a mask must wear one in an indoor public place. An “indoor public place” is any location that is not a private residence; therefore, masks are required at all open houses and showings.</p>
<p><strong>New York City Vaccine Mandate</strong></p>
<p>Any licensee that conducts business in New York City must now provide proof of vaccination to their broker, even if that brokerage is not in NYC. Brokerages must maintain copies of these records. A “workplace,” for purposes of this mandate means any place where there is more than one person; therefore, this requirement would apply to agents at showings and open houses.</p>
<p>Further, those brokerages that have offices in NYC must prohibit anyone from accessing the brokerage who is not vaccinated, with the exception of those who enter for a brief, limited purpose. Medical and religious exemptions will still apply.</p>
<p><strong>NYSAR/REBNY v. DOS Litigation</strong></p>
<p>The case over whether the DOS overreached with their guidance concerning the paying of commissions was decided. As a result, landlords can continue to pass their commission costs (listing agent and tenant agent) on to the tenant.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>These changes only scratch the surface of the changes that have taken place over the past year, and there are certainly more to come. Remember, as a Realtor you are required to know your profession and the regulations related to your activities, so continue to stay abreast of new developments through HGAR, OneKey, NYSAR and NAR announcements and articles.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The legislation was passed as a direct result of Newsday’s investigative report entitled “Long Island Divided” and addresses many of the concerns and issues uncovered in the investigation.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On Dec. 21, 2021, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed expansive new legislation contained in nine bills aimed to combat housing discrimination in New York State [see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3FfcBXJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3FfcBXJ</a>]. The legislation was passed as a direct result of <em>Newsday</em>’s investigative report entitled “Long Island Divided” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3zKUQP0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3zKUQP0</a>] and addresses many of the concerns and issues uncovered in the investigation.</p>
<p>Some critical elements of the legislation deal with the added requirements of brokers, as well as associate brokers, relating to their duty to supervise and the implementation of standardized operating procedures for all brokerage firms. The new legislation also implements additional anti-discrimination, anti-bias, cultural competency training requirements, as well as increasing the amount of maximum fines and licensing and renewal fees for all licensees.</p>
<p><strong>Broker’s Duty to Supervise Under RPL § 441 And § 175.21 of the Rules and Regulations: A Review of The Existing Standards</strong></p>
<p>Section §175.21(a) of the Department of State’s Rules and Regulations provides that “[t]he supervision of a real estate salesperson by a licensed real estate broker, required by subdivision l(d) of §441 of the Real Property Law, shall consist of regular, frequent and consistent personal guidance, instruction, oversight and superintendence by the real estate broker with respect to the general real estate brokerage business conducted by the broker, and all matters relating thereto.”</p>
<p>In light of the recent developments stemming from the <em>Newsday</em> report and the new legislation, it is now more important than ever for brokers to think about the procedures they currently have in place to supervise the actions of their licensees. As pointed out in my <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/legal-advocacy/legal-corner-discrimination-cases-from-newsdays-li-divided-finally-making-their-way-through-the-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2021 column in Real Estate In-Depth,</a> the DOS and NYS Human Rights Commission have filed complaints against many of the brokers and salespersons involved in the investigation which are making their way through the system.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Court of Appeals Decision in Roberts Real Estate, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>In 1992, the New York Court of Appeals issued a landmark decision in <em>Roberts Real Estate, Inc. v. Department of State</em> (80 NY2d 116, 589 NYS2d 392 (1992)). New York’s highest court held that when a supervising broker is unaware (i.e., does not have “actual knowledge”) of the actions of a salesperson and upon finding that the salesperson has acted improperly, even where there may be a failure to supervise, the penalty to the principal broker is limited to a fine pursuant to Real Property Law § 442-c.</p>
<p>In Roberts, the New York State Department of State “…sought judicial interpretation of Real Property Law § 442-c that would allow it to suspend or revoke a corporate broker&#8217;s license based on interpreting ‘actual knowledge’ to include imputed knowledge of employee-salespersons.” The Court of Appeals concluded that the interpretation of the DOS was not supported by the RPL and held that the DOS was not permitted to suspend the license of the broker based upon an “imputed knowledge” standard. The court did indicate, however, that the “…absence of actual knowledge does not insulate real estate brokers from disciplinary measures less severe than license suspension or revocation…” and remanded the case back to the DOS to allow it to consider a lesser sanction (i.e., a fine).</p>
<p>The DOS in <em>Division of Licensing Services v Bell,</em> 21 DOS 89 (1989), also similarly held that “…[w]here…the salesperson acts in such a way as to prevent the broker from being aware of his conduct, it cannot be said that the broker failed to meet his supervisory obligations.” While the current standard would seem to protect a broker against revocation or suspension if the broker was not aware of the discrimination, several DOS complaints filed as a result of the <em>Newsday</em> investigation also name the brokers for “failure to supervise.”</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Standardized Operating Procedures&#8217; Implemented Under the New Legislation</strong></p>
<p>One part of the newly enacted legislation (S.2131-A/A.618 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3zQfDAH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3zQfDAH</a>]) amends RPL § 442-h of the real property law by adding subdivision 4, which “…directs the Secretary of State…to promulgate rules and regulations requiring real estate brokers to institute standardized operating procedures for the prerequisites prospective homebuyers must meet prior to receiving any services.” The legislation will require brokers to submit these procedures to the DOS. The DOS will be required to maintain a copy of the procedures while the broker is licensed “…and for at least five years thereafter.” The broker will also be required to submit any changes to the procedures to DOS within 30 days of any such change thereto.</p>
<p>The legislation provides that any salesperson who fails to abide by the procedures will be subject to the penalties under RPL § 441-c. Additionally, the legislation further amends RPL § 441-c by permitting the DOS to revoke or suspend the license of a real estate broker or salesperson should they violate this new subdivision 4 of RPL § 442-h. The legislature explains that this requirement will “…allow for client intake procedures to be monitored and standardized, preventing discriminatory practices.”</p>
<p><strong>Associate Brokers Serving as Office Managers Must Now Supervise Other Real Estate Professionals</strong></p>
<p>This new legislation (S.2157-A/A.6355 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/33fiGGy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/33fiGGy</a>]) introduces a critical change to the existing law with respect to the oversight standards of associate brokers who act as office managers. Under the new law, associate brokers who serve as office managers must now supervise other licensed salespersons and associate brokers in their office. Additionally, in order to qualify to be appointed as an office manager, the associate broker “…must have been active in the real estate industry two of the four years before beginning duties as office manager.” This new legislation now holds an associate broker, who is an office manager, to the same oversight standards of a principal broker.</p>
<p>Brokers having multiple locations usually appoint associate brokers as office managers to supervise branch offices. The legislature points out that associate brokers, while licensed under the same standards as brokers, “…are not held to the same statutory obligations of oversight placed on brokers at their principal place of business.” Under the previous law, an office manager/associate broker was only “…held to the same standards as a real estate agent while [at the same time] maintaining their broker&#8217;s license.”</p>
<p>It is the legislature’s view that the “…lack of oversight over agents by office managers can manifest itself with agents who are not properly trained and supervised in their behavior, performance, and compliance with fair housing regulations.” According to the legislature, the “…bill ensures that proper oversight is given over real estate agents irrespective of whether they are working out of a broker&#8217;s principal place of business or branch office under an office manager.” This is a major change in the current law. The “duty to supervise” now extends to associate brokers acting as office managers. In most proceedings brought against licensees by the DOS, the DOS commonly names the principal broker in the complaint for a “failure to supervise.” The DOS will now certainly name the associate broker-office manager in a complaint.</p>
<p><strong>The Independent Contractor Relationship In Light of the New Legislation</strong></p>
<p>The independent contractor relationship, which requires payment of compensation to salespersons based only on sales production, requires that the employing broker not “direct and control” the salesperson. The DOS requirement to supervise the activities of the salesperson does not give the principal broker the right to “direct and control” the activities of the licensed salesperson or associate broker. The principal broker cannot instruct a salesperson to be in the office at a particular time, work specific hours or to take specific customers to properties designated by the principal broker.</p>
<p>The DOS and RPL, however, require brokers (and now associate brokers-office managers) to monitor the activities of the salesperson and have the “duty to supervise.” This duty of supervision consists of “…regular, frequent and consistent personal guidance, instruction, oversight and superintendence….” There has always been a concern for principal brokers when dealing with the “direction and control” versus “supervision” issue. This was lessened after amendments to the Workers Compensation Law and Labor Law which outlined clearly the circumstances under which a salesperson would be considered an independent contractor in New York.</p>
<p>An additional requirement is that there be a written contract with the salesperson in the form prescribed by statute and that the principal broker and salesperson live to the letter of New York law. Doing so also complies with the Internal Revenue Code provisions (IRC Section 3508) which indicate that if a real estate salesperson has a written contract, he or she will be presumed to be an independent contractor.</p>
<p>While all of the above independent contractor standards remain in place, the new legislation does introduce many additional supervision and training requirements for the broker, and for those associate brokers who are appointed as office managers. For years, principal brokers were discouraged from creating office manuals because they might be construed as an indication of “direction and control,” but the new legislation now mandates the creation of “standardized operating procedures” to be provided to prospective clients before they are permitted to provide real estate brokerage services. While the rules and regulations have yet to be promulgated, it is important that brokers continue to consider and comply with all of the independent contractor standards previously considered, and to closely monitor the progress of these yet to be promulgated rules and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Highlights of the New Discrimination Legislation</strong></p>
<p>Two of the bills signed into law (S.945-B/A.6866 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Fdmbuc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Fdmbuc</a>] and S.2133-A/A.5363 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3nkzqTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3nkzqTU</a>]) provide for increases in surcharges and fines payable by licensees and also establish an Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund. The fines contained in paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of § 441-c have been increased from a maximum of $1,000 to a maximum of $2,000. The legislation also provides that 50% of the revenue from these fines are directed to the Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund. The funds will be used for fair housing testing and the Attorney General is authorized to “…allocate grants to various government and non-governmental entities specializing in anti-housing discrimination.”</p>
<p>Brokers and salespersons will now be required to pay surcharges when paying licensing and renewal fees. Brokers will be required to pay $30 and licensed real estate salespersons will be required to pay $10. The funds generated from these surcharges will also go to the Anti-Discrimination in Housing Fund for fair housing testing efforts. Therefore, with the increased funding available, expansion of testing efforts will undoubtedly begin to ramp up. Brokers and agents need to make every effort to comply with all anti-discrimination and fair housing laws.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Anti-Discrimination and Fair Housing Training</strong></p>
<p>Three of the bills (S.2132-B/A.5359 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3HZIZ2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3HZIZ2a</a>]; S.538-B/S.4638-A [<a href="https://bit.ly/3nkD5RE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3nkD5RE</a>]; and S.979-A/A.844-A [<a href="https://bit.ly/3Fle5j4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Fle5j4</a>]) also expanded continuing education requirements relating to implicit bias training, anti-bias training, education based on historical “legacy of segregation, unequal treatment and…lack of access to housing.” Training must include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>• The legacy of segregation, unequal treatment, and historic lack of access to housing opportunities.</p>
<p>• Unequal access to amenities and resources on the basis of race, disability and other protected characteristics.</p>
<p>• Federal, state, and local fair housing laws.</p>
<p>• Anti-bias training.</p>
<p>Brokers and salespersons are also required to take two hours of training relating to implicit bias as part of their continuing education requirements and license renewal process. According to the legislature, the new law “…ensures that all real estate professionals are made aware of how harmful implicit bias can be and how to ensure they follow fair housing guidelines.”</p>
<p>Finally, the legislation also requires that courses in “cultural competency” be included in the licensing curriculum for brokers and salespersons. Brokers and salespersons must take two hours of training in “comprehensive cultural competency.” These additional hourly course requirements are included within, and are not in addition to, the current 22.5 hours of continuing education required for renewal.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Changes in the Regulatory Landscape</strong></p>
<p>The regulatory landscape in New York’s real estate industry has experienced many critical and substantive changes over the past few years. Brokers and agents have had to deal with not only the regulatory changes but also the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. It has not been easy, but through it all real estate agents have remained resolute and strong.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>YONKERS—Great Point Studios officially opened the doors to its long-awaited Lionsgate Studios Yonkers on Jan. 11 at 45 Wells Ave. and announced that it will move forward with a more than $500-million expansion plan nearby.</p>
<p>The expansion project announced by Great Point Studios Founder and CEO Robert Halmi calls for a 1-million-square-foot facility that will feature more 20,000 square foot stages on one campus than any other facility in the Northeast. The campus will include a total of 11 soundstages: eight 20,000-square-foot stages, two 10,000-square-foot stages, and a 30,000 square-foot stage. It will also include parking for more than 750 cars and 100 trucks. Halmi also announced new long-term tenants for the facility, which include Lionsgate, Mediapro and Syracuse University.</p>
<p>When completed, the project on Wells Avenue in Yonkers will be the largest modern-built film and television production facility in the Northeast, according to Green Point Studios officials.</p>
<p>The campus will feature state-of-the-art film stages, post-production facilities, screening rooms, office space and support space. It will offer a full set of production services on site, including grip and electric, equipment, props, set building, restaurants, location catering, cleaning service, and security.</p>
<p>Three of the large stages and 500,000 square feet of office and support space are now open for business, while Great Point has also purchased approximately eight acres of additional land around the originally announced studio site. The expansion of additional stages and office space are already under construction and are scheduled to be completed in phases starting in September 2022 with total completion slated for December 2023.</p>
<p>Global content leader Lionsgate has expanded its role as anchor tenant, and will occupy seven of the complex’s 11 stages, along with office and support space. Besides its theatrical film presence, Lionsgate is producing more than 40 television shows for various broadcast outlets, including its own Starz platform.</p>
<p>“With demand for new content greater than ever and prime studio space at a premium, we’re pleased to partner with Great Point on the opportunity to become an anchor tenant of the Yonkers Studios,” said Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer. “They will give our television and film productions state-of-the-art East Coast sound stages with great proximity to New York City, and we look forward to them becoming an important hub for our global production activities.”</p>
<p>Mediapro, a leading group in the global audiovisual sector, unique in content integration, production and audiovisual distribution, has also inked a long-term deal to be a key tenant on the site. Mediapro will take occupancy of its first stage later this year and they have options on two more of the planned expansion stages. Their first stage is expected to be completed this winter.</p>
<p>The S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University has also come on as a partner at Lionsgate Studios. Syracuse University will work with Great Point Studios to create a distinctive learning and fully hands-on working experience for television, radio and film students. Beginning this month, the school will utilize the facility as a giant classroom and will have access to all stages and equipment at Lionsgate Studio Yonkers, Great Point Studios stated in an announcement.</p>
<p>The Newhouse NYC program is a specialized program for Newhouse students from all majors, placing them in NYC for a semester where they intern and take classes. This alliance will allow television, radio and film students enrolled in the Newhouse NYC program to become fully immersed in a production experience through coursework and hands-on internships. Undergraduate juniors and seniors will be part of the inaugural program.</p>
<p>“At the Newhouse School, we are always looking for ways to ensure that our students have access to front-line industry experiences,” said S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University dean Mark J. Lodato. “The immersive film environment at Lionsgate Studios Yonkers is visionary, and will propel our film experience, particularly on the East Coast. Thanks to our alumnus Robert Halmi and Great Point Studios, we are thrilled to be able to offer our film students the opportunity to learn and work at what will be one of the most cutting-edge media enterprises in the country.”</p>
<p>Great Point Studios founder Halmi called upon decades of experience as founder of the Hallmark Channel and a producer of more than 400 film and television projects to create a facility that fits the needs of these cutting-edge companies. “We have a shared vision for the future of the entertainment industry, and it’s reflected in every detail we put into this complex,” Halmi says. “Given the expected rise in studio production post-COVID, we are confident that expanding our Yonkers studio will attract quality tenants. We are proud that Lionsgate, Mediapro and Syracuse University share our vision and are strongly supporting our project.”</p>
<p>A key investment partner and project developer at Lionsgate Studios Yonkers is National Resources. The company has operated in the New York area for 30 years and has tallied up more than $1.5 billion in construction and redevelopment projects. National Resources will be responsible for all phases of development and construction of the studio complex. “We are very proud to work with Great Point Studios and Lionsgate to help change the production industry landscape,” says National Resources CEO, Joe Cotter. “Our combined efforts will help make the newly revitalized Yonkers a sought-after destination for talent from around the world.”</p>
<p>Great Point Studio’s institutional financial partner is an affiliate of Lindsay Goldberg, a private investment firm focused on partnering with entrepreneurs and family-owned businesses to help them grow.</p>
<p>Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano said of the expansion project by Great Point Studios. “This state-of-the-art media complex will help complete the transformation of the Yonkers waterfront. Local commerce will benefit from the expected 1000+ people working at the studio complex daily. We look forward to welcoming Great Point Studios, Lionsgate and all of the new companies to Yonkers in the new year.”</p>

Kathy Hochul to the New York State Department of Transportation to undertake an environmental review of the conversion of Route 17 to federal Inter]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The prospect of major upgrades—including the construction of what business and government leaders say is a much-needed third lane on portions of Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties—just got a step closer.</p>
<p>Although not included in her State of the State speech on Jan, 5, accompanying material given to state lawmakers included a directive from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to the New York State Department of Transportation to undertake an environmental review of the conversion of Route 17 to federal Interstate 86 (I-86).</p>
<p>In her “State of the State Book “presentation, the governor said that as part of her multi-faceted transportation investment initiatives the state would accelerate the conversion of Route 17 into I-86 in Orange and Sullivan counties. Gov. Hochul stated, “Strategic investments in the Mid-Hudson Valley have resulted in the expansion of Woodbury Common and the construction of Legoland and the Resorts World Catskills Casino. Over the past several years, projects have been completed by NYSDOT to upgrade sections of Route 17, including reconstruction of the interchange at Exit 131, where Route 17 meets Interstate 87 and Route 32 (Woodbury Common), and reconstruction of Exits 122 and 125 (Legoland) to meet interstate standards. To facilitate future economic competitiveness and alleviate congestion within the region, the state will begin an environmental review to assess the conversion of the full Route 17 corridor in Orange and Sullivan counties to Interstate 86.”</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Transportation released a statement in connection with the governor’s directive to accelerate the conversion of Route 17 to I-86, which stated: “As Governor Hochul said in the State of the State Address, the state will undertake an environmental review to assess the conversion of the full Route 17 corridor in Orange and Sullivan counties to Interstate 86. This study will build on the work of the recently completed Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) study and look at alternatives along the 47-mile corridor between Orange and Sullivan counties, including Monticello.”</p>
<p>Michael Fleischer, a consultant with the 17-Forward 86 coalition, said that based on discussions with NYSDOT officials and the department’s aforementioned statement, the environmental review will include the potential addition of a third lane on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties that was included in a recently released Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) study by the New York State Department of Transportation. The study released in November 2021 rejected several options to improve congestion on Route 17 and determined a host of others should move forward to the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) phase, including the construction of a third lane on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties, upgrades to interchanges on Route 17 in both counties and improvements be undertaken to improve connectivity to transit.</p>
<p>He also noted that the length of time for the environmental review process could be shortened considerably since the PEL study involved a significant amount of work that would have to be performed in the environmental review. Fleischer noted that the environmental review will therefore not be starting from scratch.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Transportation has stated that the EIS would address the engineering, social, economic and environmental impacts associated with potential corridor alternatives. If the preferred alternative was to construct a third travel lane, the EIS would also include any necessary mitigation actions/strategies.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president and CEO of the Orange County Partnership and co-chair of the17-Forward-86 Coalition, said, “Yesterday afternoon Governor Kathy Hochul conveyed her vision for New York during her powerful State of the State address. During a time when New York’s recovery is most critical, the Governor specifically has a plan for economic development through infrastructure rebuild, shovel ready sites and regional councils that focus on regional growth strategies, including the conversation of Route 17 to Interstate 86.”</p>
<p>Halahan later stated that she believes that the governor’s directive requires the EIS to include a thorough review of the third lane option for Route 17.</p>
<p>The 17-Forward 86 Coalition released a statement on social media in response to the governor’s State of the State Address, stating, “Our 17-Forward-86 Coalition is grateful to Gov. Hochul for making Route 17 a priority for investment and we look forward to working with her administration to make these long-needed upgrades a reality.”</p>
<p>The final report from the New York State Department of Transportation’s Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group recommended the state move forward with an environmental review of a General Use Third Lane in each direction on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties that could if built as one major project cost anywhere from $650 million to $1.27 billion. The PEL Study Group also called for a study of interchange upgrades be undertaken at exits in Orange and Sullivan counties and that improvements be made in the region to improve connectivity to existing transit.</p>
<p>The scope of the construction of the General Use Third Lane beginning at Exit 131 in Harriman (Orange County) to Exit 103 (Rapp Road) in Monticello in Sullivan County would determine the cost of the project.</p>
<p>Option 1, which involves using the basic existing footprint of the roadway and shoulders to accommodate a third lane in each direction would cost $385 million to $470 million for the Orange County stretch of roadway and another $265 million to $325 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>Under Option 2, which would involve widening the existing roadway to accommodate the third lane expansions in both directions so that most of Route 17 would conform to federal Interstate standards, the costs would escalate. For the Orange County section, the cost would run between $615 million to $750 million, while the Sullivan County component’s cost ranges from $425 million to $520 million.</p>
<p>The PEL Study Group did not recommend one option over the other and also while listing interchanges in Orange and Sullivan counties that could be upgraded, it did not issue any specific recommendations, although it did point out those with the greatest need.</p>
<p>In referencing the need for a General Use Third Lane, the study group stated, “Reconstruction under the General Use Third Lane Alternative would provide the opportunity to address deficiencies in the existing roadway to correct non-standard features and storm-related flooding. High crash locations containing curves and overpasses would benefit from widening shoulders, increasing pavement friction, and increased banking (removal of non-conforming super elevation) under this concept. Increasing the capacity of Route 17 would provide a 24% reduction in congestion related crashes overall, per the Crash Modification Factors Clearinghouse.”</p>
<p>The study indicated the cost of the interchange upgrades in Orange County could run from $135 million to $175 million and in Sullivan County from $43 million to $144 million.</p>
<p>Improvements to Connectivity to Existing Transit projects are projected to cost between $1 million to $1.5 million in Sullivan County and $9 million to $10 million in Orange County.</p>
<p>The study group also recommended moving forward with a No Build scenario, but that was done chiefly because it is a requirement of the National Environmental Policy Review Act (NEPA) process for any proposed Route 17 project. The group also considered the construction of a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane and the addition of Light Rail and Bus Rapid Transit but did not recommend going forward on any of those options.</p>
<p>While study group officials have stated at previous virtual public workshops that the full project would likely not move forward all at once due to funding constraints and other factors, the report listed the total project cost involving the construction of the General Use Third Lane, interchange improvements and improvements to connectivity to existing transit projects would run from $529 million to $935 million in Orange County and $309 million to $665.5 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>While the Route 17 expansion may qualify for some federal funding, it is likely that the overall project would be done in phases and based on the report it appears work would begin on a stretch of the roadway in Orange County.</p>
<p>“As previously noted, NYSDOT will determine the logical termini and specific project limits of the General Use Third Lane Alternative in the future, following careful consideration of existing and projected traffic congestion, public and agency input, and available funding,” the report stated. “Based on this Route 17 PEL Study, the area of greatest need appears to be between Exits 120 (NY Route 211 – Wallkill) and 131 (Woodbury), a distance of approximately 22 miles, and the segment of the corridor that is projected to experience the highest levels of congestion in the year 2055.”</p>
<p>Advocates for the Route 17 expansion were heartened to learn that the project could receive funding from the $1.2-trillion infrastructure bill recently signed into law by President Biden when U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-CD18) listed the Route 17 project at a press conference in Newburgh on Nov. 8 as one that could qualify for federal funding. He referenced the Infrastructure Act’s $13.5 billion that will go directly to New York State’s highways and bridges, and said that revamping Route 17 through Orange County is “a much-needed project that has been stalled for too long.”</p>
<p>“Route 17 can receive funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” a spokesman for Rep. Maloney said. “However, the law does not directly earmark funds to specific projects. It will be up to New York State to determine how to dedicate their funds from this legislation to projects like Route 17. However, as he has throughout the legislative process drafting the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Rep. Maloney will continue to fight for funding for critical projects and priorities here in the Hudson Valley.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The embattled Orange County Industrial Development Agency is in the midst of implementing reforms in response to a corruption scandal that rocked the agency and the county’s business community last year with guilty pleas by two of its chief administrative officers and a member of its Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Shortly after the three individuals— Orange County IDA Managing Director Vincent Cozzolino, IDA Chief Executive Officer Laurie Villasuso and Board Director Edward Diana—agreed to repay the IDA approximately $1.27 million in restitution in September 2021 as part of plea agreements that afforded them no jail time for their acts of corruption, the IDA hired Bill Fioravanti as its new executive director. The guilty pleas were the result of a joint investigation by the Orange County District Attorney’s office, the State Comptroller’s office and the New Windsor Police Department.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-39613" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FIORAVANTI-HEAD-SHOT-PIC.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" />Fioravanti, who was serving as interim executive director of the IDA shortly after the scandal broke in March 2001 at the direction of Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, was appointed to permanent status by the IDA Board of Directors in October of last year. Since then, Fioravanti has been working with the Orange County IDA Board of Directors, chaired by Mike Torelli, to institute new policies and procedures aimed at bringing more transparency to its operations, as well as restore the public trust in the organization. The Orange County Legislature had voted unanimously to remove the prior Board of Directors in the early days of the scandal.</p>
<p>Fioravanti had served since May 2018 as Orange County’s Director of Economic Development up until his permanent appointment as IDA Executive Director this past fall. Previously, the City of Newburgh resident was the Director of Business Attraction for the Orange County Partnership for more than four years. He also has served as the Associate Executive Director of the YMCA of Middletown and the executive director for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Orange and Sullivan Counties.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> You were recently named Executive Director of the Orange County IDA after splitting time as Interim IDA Director and as Economic Development Director for Orange County. What are your chief short-term goals in respect to returning public trust in the scandal-ridden agency?</p>
<p><strong>Fioravanti:</strong> I think really it is all about openness. There was a time when this agency was more closed-off from its partners and from members of the public and I think you are going to see an immediate about face in that regard. Obviously, we operate under General Municipal Laws and we have to have open meetings. We have to be clear about what is on our agendas and you will see all that from us. We are continuing to work with the Board Chair and the entire Board (of Directors) to ensure transparency in all the actions taken by the Board.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am a bit of a known commodity in the county and the region and I think people know what I am about, that I am about community development and economic development. It is not economic development at any cost. It is what is best for the county, the municipalities and the residents and our businesses as well. So, I believe that played a part in my appointment that people know what they get with me. Transparency is something we are going to work on every day; working to restore the public’s trust.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What are some of the reforms the new IDA Board of Directors have instituted and what other measures do you expect to implement in the near future to increase transparency and improve efficiencies at the IDA?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-39615" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JVP_0019.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />Fioravanti:</strong> Well, we are certainly strictly adhering to the guidelines, not just the GML (General Municipal Law), but the Authorities Budget Office that really oversees public authorities like ours. There are very strict guidelines for your website, what needs to be posted and when, transparency of projects, documents, communications and things like that. In addition, in terms of annual reporting, (there are guidelines) on projects that received incentives and what milestones they have to reach in terms of jobs created and such. We need to ensure that there is complete transparency and accountability in those regards. So, we have a new General Counsel that we recently hired—Susan Katzoff of the law firm Bousquet Holstein, PLLC of Syracuse. Frankly, I think this plays into your question, you are going to see us re-procure every service we have here. Whether it is legal counsel, we also do local labor audits of local labor (hiring) requirements we have, everything down to cleaning you will see us re-procure everything so that the public knows that there are no favors, there are no preferences or preferential treatment. Everything is on the up and up. The same thing goes for our projects. There is annual reporting and all of that is completely transparent.</p>
<p>Other than that, the Board is operating in a way that is very open. We invite our partners in the region and in the state, whether it is the foreign trade zone, the Orange County Partnership, (Orange County) Chamber of Commerce, we do want to have a symbiotic relationship and seamless coordination (with these organizations). I think that is something that Orange County has always done a tremendous job of. No matter what is going on behind the scenes, we have a very well-run economic development machine and we all work very well together to get deals done. I think Orange County is known for getting deals done and it is not always that easy. Not everything we have done has been slam dunks, but we come together to make sure it is in the right project in the right place and that the right support and resources are there.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Fioravanti then addressed some conflict of issue matters that surfaced as part of the corruption investigation.</p>
<p>There were, actually, very loose conflict of interest policies on forms that were completed and this Board months ago passed new (stricter) conflict of interest policies. (While he noted that conflict of interest regulations would not have prevented the actions of the past staff and Board Director, he did note that you also need “leadership that you can count on and believe in, with integrity and I think that was the main criteria when the County Legislature was looking for a new slate of Board Directors were ethics and a lack of conflicts and people that were here to do the right thing. And I think that when they made their next big step with rebuilding the organization by hiring me, I think that was in mind as well.”</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> After guilty pleas, the IDA was reimbursed more than $1 million by former IDA staff and a member of the Board of Directors. There have been some discussions at previous IDA sessions of possible further actions to be taken in connection with the corruption scandal. Can you provide an update?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-39614" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JVP_0011.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" />Fioravanti:</strong> I won’t elaborate much on this because it is a legal case and quite frankly because it is not my focus. I am really focused on moving this agency forward in attracting businesses and growing the economy. Obviously, it is a legitimate concern. Of course, there was the Office of the State Comptroller’s report that was done in conjunction with the District Attorney so we have a lot of recommendations and problems that were outlined in that report and the Orange County Legislature recently put out a report so we use that as a basis (for change) as well. Based upon that information and all of the documents and everything we collected for those investigations, the Board did as I mentioned previously, hire a new Legal Counsel, who is advising us on these matters; working with the County Attorney’s Office, who has been our Interim Counsel since the transition of leadership. The Board has authorized at its recent Board meeting a review by our new Legal Counsel of possible claims and implementation of any required action.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> When asked if those possible claims involve any legal claim in connection with the corruption scandal, Fioravanti responded, “Yes, like a civil proceeding essentially. I think we all know what was done and what was the extent and we are talking millions of dollars (in addition to the restitution funds received by the IDA). “There were more expenses that were incurred as the result of the illegitimate actions of the prior administration. So, to any extend that is recoverable, I think that is what the (IDA) Board will be considering and again our new Legal Counsel will lead us through that (review),” Fioravanti said.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Understandably, the IDA saw a decrease in activity as it reorganized its operations. Are you beginning to see new projects coming before the IDA for consideration and are you working cooperatively with other economic development organizations, including the Orange County Partnership, to advance new development ventures in the county?</p>
<p><strong>Fioravanti:</strong> The simple answer is “Yes, absolutely.” We are seeing a lot of activity. We do have some potential applications in the pipeline from business attractions and expansions we have spoken to. But, the longer play on that is, just as you asked, working with our partners in Orange County and the region—our economic development partners—to create new opportunities. This Board is clear that they are pro-business. They want to incentivize good projects that are deserving and we want to do it the right way. We want them to be good partners that will be accountable and will do what they commit to be doing in terms of job creation and the other guidelines. But, I am excited to say that (investor) interest has started to ramp up for sure. Again, we are going to work with the Orange County Partnership and our other partners, including Empire State Development, to help develop new opportunities. Orange County is always very competitive, we are in the game on a lot of great projects and I expect that to continue to be the same going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The Orange County IDA operated a number of Accelerators in New Windsor, Middletown and Newburgh. Is the IDA looking to exit the Accelerator business or will it continue to operate some of these small business Accelerator locations?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39616 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JVP_0035-2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="250" />Fioravanti:</strong> You are already seeing us downsize some of our Accelerator operations by attrition as our roster of businesses start to fade and our leases expire in various locations. To put it in perspective, the Board of Directors approved in October our 2022 fiscal budget and it represented a $2.3-million reduction in expenses and that was without shutting down the Accelerator program, just by attrition what has receded and cutting all the management expenses related to them. Galileo (Technology Group, the firm previously in charge of management of the IDA Accelerator) was due $880,000 in 2021 for just managing the Accelerator program… So, just cutting those expenses, mostly around the management of the program, was a tremendous cost savings.</p>
<p>I think you are going to see us continue the Accelerators sure. I think that with whatever the IDA does, we are looking to make smart, calculated investments in economic development. We are looking at the Accelerator locations on a case-by-case basis. There were obvious decisions which had to be made. For example, in Highland Falls where there was a supposed Artificial Intelligence Accelerator and we were renting a former bank there for several months and there were zero tenants. (<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: The IDA has extricated itself from several of its leases at the Highland Falls property) … I will tell you our top concern in any of these locations are the businesses that are in there. Most of them are really hard-working people with dreams that the Accelerator was really supposed to be supporting. So, we are trying to support them, but we don’t have the same staff as GTG… On a skeleton crew we are trying to do the best we can. I think you are going to see us not wanting to be landlords. So, as our valid leases expire, we are going to try and work with the landlords and those sub-tenants (and have them do direct leases with the landlord) and support them when we can.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Fioravanti concluded the interview by saying that the IDA in the future hopes to duplicate its involvement in the redevelopment of a former prison site in Warwick into a thriving commercial center. The IDA was reimbursed a total of $2.5 million of its $3-million in financing of the Warwick Valley Office and Technology Corporate Park. The IDA’s net investment of $500,000 has transformed the property into a cutting-edge commercial hub that has produced revenue and hundreds of new jobs for the town and the county.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[To say there are headwinds facing Realtors and consumers in 2022 would be an understatement, with the prospects for high inflation, rising mortgage interest rates, supply chain problems, the Omicron variant and very low for-sale inventories high on the list. At press time, infection rates statewide ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—After residential sales volume in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ market area reached historically high levels in 2021, brokers expect continued strong sales activity this year, although not at the feverish pace the industry enjoyed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>To say there are headwinds facing Realtors and consumers in 2022 would be an understatement, with the prospects for high inflation, rising mortgage interest rates, supply chain problems, the Omicron variant and very low for-sale inventories high on the list. At press time, infection rates statewide and in the Hudson Valley and New York City regions continue to fall daily from highs in the mid 20% rates, perhaps a sign that the worst of the Omicron variant is behind the region, although infection rates continue to climb in other parts of the nation.</p>
<p>HGAR and OneKey MLS recently released the <a href="https://www.hgar.com/content/uploads/2022/01/2021-Q4-HGAR-Onekey-MLS-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Fourth Quarter and Annual Residential Real Estate Sales Report Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Bronx Counties, New York</a>. The report noted that residential sales in all markets, with the exception of the Bronx, fell sharply in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. While sales in the Bronx shot up 39.8%, activity in Rockland County fell 10.8%, followed by a 15% drop in sales volume in Westchester County. Orange, Sullivan and Putnam counties saw home sales declines of 15.2%, 18.4% and 25.2% respectively.</p>
<p>The drop off in sales in the fourth quarter was an anomaly for all markets for the year. All posted sizable sales increases for the year as compared to 2020. Bronx County had the largest percentage increase in residential sales at 61.4% year-over-year with 2,553 units sold as compared to 1,582 sales for 2020. Rockland County led the northern counties with an increase of 19.3% (3,631 units compared to 3,044 units in 2020); Westchester, a close second, posted 19.1% increase (11,855 units compared to 9,955 units for 2020); followed by Orange County with a 16% increase (5,406 residential sales compared to 4,662 sales in 2020); Putnam experienced a 10.6% increase over 2020 (1,605 units compared to 1,451) and Sullivan County had a 9.6% increase for 2021 (1,393 compared to 1,271 in 2020).</p>
<p>For perspective, the HGAR/OneKey MLS report noted that while there were significant decreases in the number of residential sales in all counties, except the Bronx, when comparing the 2021 fourth quarter to the 2020 fourth quarter sales, it is important to remember that the fourth quarter 2020 sales were fueled by a surge in buying activity in the second half of 2020 once COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. The report concluded that, “A more realistic comparison would be to the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, and the 2021 fourth quarter residential sales numbers were significantly higher than either of those two years.”</p>
<p>The migration of New York City residents to the Hudson Valley fueled sales activity as well as increases in the median sale price in all markets. The median price of a single-family residence in Bronx County increased 8.5% to $575,000. The largest percentage price increase for a single-family home occurred in Sullivan County with a 25.3% increase to $244,400 from $195,000 in 2020. Westchester County saw a 6.1% increase in its median price for the year ($780,000 as compared to $735,000 in 2020) and actually experienced a slight decrease (-0.8%) in median price for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Orange County single-family median price year-over-year rose 16.5% ($367,000 compared to $315,000 in 2020), while Rockland County’s single-family median sale price increased 12% to $560,000 (from $500,00 in 2020). Putnam County saw its single-family median price rise 15.8% to $440,000 (from $380,000 in 2020) for the year.</p>
<p>A persistent problem for the suburban New York markets has been low inventory, which has resulted in intense competition for quality listings and multiple bids. According to the HGAR/OneKey MLS report, inventory (for all types of housing) at the end of 2021 fell 53.5% in Rockland; 28.8% in Westchester; 31.4% in Orange; 27.2% and 13.0% in Putnam. Inventory in the Bronx increased 4.8%. <strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: For the full HGAR/OneKey MLS report, go to pages 6, 7 and 8 in the second section of the newspaper.</p>
<p>HGAR President Anthony Domathoti said there was a slowing of sales in the HGAR market region, with the exception of the Bronx, in the fourth quarter. He believes that the migration out of New York City may be at an end.</p>
<p>He said that buyers are now returning to Manhattan and the outer boroughs. “So, it is the return of the buyer to the New York City market that is writing the narrative for the fourth quarter of 2021,” he said.</p>
<p>Domathoti, who is Broker-Owner of EXIT Realty Premium in the Bronx, pointed out the tremendous sales surge in the Bronx in 2021 with a nearly 62% increase in activity, including a nearly 46% spike in single-family home sales.</p>
<p>Domathoti believes that while conditions are still good for sellers, the rate of home price increases in the suburban markets are not sustainable.</p>
<p>“The economy continues to improve, which is good for real estate, but at the same time the price increases in 2022 will be moderate. It will not be like what happened in 2021.”</p>
<p>Brokerage firm Houlihan Lawrence in its fourth quarter report stated that the low supply of listings led to a natural decline in the number of sales in the suburban markets in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>“While the first half of 2021 varied in specific metrics to the second half, two factors remained constant. The inventory was at an all-time low, and buyer demand was exceptionally strong. As the year progressed, the sales outpaced inventory replacement, and this further restriction led to a decline in pending sales and, eventually, closed sales,” said Houlihan Lawrence President and CEO Liz Nunan.</p>
<p>She continued. “2022 will likely not see the record-breaking number of sales seen in 2021. But until the supply and demand fall into balance, the market will still be charged with buyers, and sellers will continue to prosper.”</p>
<p>Anthony P. Cutugno, Senior Vice President, Director of Private Brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence, speaking on the luxury market said that like the conventional home sales market, the fourth quarter saw lower luxury sales in the region.</p>
<p>“As the supply of luxury homes declined to historic lows, closed sales cooled down—every luxury market registered double-digit declines this quarter. Homebuyers are not retreating, but their desire and ability to purchase a new home are often thwarted by shrinking supply. Looking forward, pending sales are down at year&#8217;s end; robust gains of 2021 will likely taper off in 2022,” he said.</p>
<p>While sales fell in the fourth quarter, Leah Caro, Broker-Owner of Park Sterling Realty in Bronxville, said that two weeks into January 2022—normally a slow time for the housing market— the market continues to be busy with buyers searching for homes in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Caro, who was a guest on the Building and Realty Institute of Westchester’s “Building Knowledge” radio program on Jan. 14, said that in terms of the 2022 housing market, “I think interest rates will tick up slightly. I don’t think that will be something that will drive people out of the buying marketplace.”</p>
<p>She believes that the rise in inflation rates will stabilize later this year and the federal government and hopes others need to address supply chain issues and other market forces that are preventing people from getting back to work or taking on new jobs.</p>
<p>With millions now receiving the COVID vaccine and boosters, Caro is hopeful that the worst of the pandemic is in the rear-view mirror. “We are definitely in for some adjustments and some changes (in 2022) but I am super optimistic, but I always am,” she said.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The surging residential real estate market of the last two years led to record-high home prices and record-low inventory. This simultaneous &#8220;double trouble&#8221; has made it increasingly difficult for consumers, particularly Black Americans, to achieve homeownership, according to a new analysis released on Feb. 7 by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com.</p>
<p>“The Double Trouble of the Housing Market” report examines the impact that rapidly escalating home prices and diminishing housing inventory has on housing affordability. Unlike previous affordability research and indices, NAR and Realtor.com considered affordability for all income groups, accounted for the affordability of homes currently available for sale instead of homes that have already sold and provided affordability data by race for the 100 largest U.S. metro areas.</p>
<p>Nationally, more than 400,000 fewer affordable homes are available for sale for households earning $75,000 to $100,000 when compared to the start of the pandemic (245,300 in December 2021 vs. 656,200 in December 2019). For that same income group, there&#8217;s one affordable listing available for every 65 households, a significant drop in availability from one affordable listing for every 24 households in 2019.</p>
<p>The total home valuation across the country is estimated to have risen by $8.1 trillion from the first quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021. However, this sizable increase in real estate values was not accompanied by a rise in homeownership as the ownership rate remained at approximately 65%.</p>
<p>“The housing wealth gain has been sizable over the past two years,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, due to the ongoing inventory shortage and rising interest rates, homeownership attainment will become especially challenging unless drastically more housing supply is available.”</p>
<p>For households with higher incomes, some expensive metro areas—San Francisco, San Jose, Washington, D.C., for example—surprisingly are more affordable than before the start of the pandemic due to increasing incomes and lower mortgage rates. Since 2019, household incomes rose 15% and 13%, respectively, in San Jose and San Francisco. However, while some households in these markets can afford to buy a greater share of homes, fewer options exist as a result of the record-low inventory. For example, households earning $100,000 to $125,000 in the San Francisco metro area can afford to buy 180 fewer homes now compared to December 2019. For households in San Francisco earning $125,000 to $150,000, there are about 300 fewer affordable homes available than in December 2019.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39747 alignright" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NAR-BLACK-HOMEOWNRSHIP-STUDY-PIC-2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="187" />“In general, an increase in salary makes housing more affordable to a buyer. But due to the reductions in inventory over the last few years, today&#8217;s buyers in large tech markets can actually afford a smaller number of homes than they could two years ago, despite an uptick in wages,” said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. “The low inventory challenge is particularly acute for some racial and ethnic groups who have faced greater hurdles to homeownership stemming from, among other things, lower incomes as a group.”</p>
<p>A significant and persistent racial homeownership gap exists in America. Since 2017, the annual homeownership rate for White Americans has remained comfortably above 70%; however, the homeownership rate for Black Americans has been slightly above 40%—nearly 30 percentage points lower. NAR and Realtor.com analyzed housing affordability by racial group to help explain the differences in homeownership. Nationwide, 35% of White households and only 20% of Black households have incomes greater than $100,000. Approximately half of all homes currently listed for sale (51%) are affordable to households with at least $100,000 income and substantial variances in affordability exist by metro area.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the homeownership rate has been around 50% for all households in the expensive metro markets, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, and therefore it&#8217;s becoming nearly impossible to afford a home, especially for Black households,” Yun added. “At the same time, there are affordable markets that still provide opportunities to achieve homeownership as inventory at affordable price points is reasonably available.”</p>
<p>NAR and Realtor.com also identified the top 10 most affordable housing markets for Black households. In alphabetical order, the markets are Akron, OH; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL.; Dayton, OH; Detroit, MI; McAllen, TX; Memphis, TN.; St. Louis, MO; Toledo, OH and Youngstown, OH. In these metro areas, Black households can afford to buy homes roughly in proportion to their income distributions.</p>
<p>To increase the nation&#8217;s housing inventory, NAR is advocating that all levels of government include funding for affordable housing construction; preserve, expand and create tax incentives to renovate distressed properties; convert unused commercial space to residential units; and encourage and incentivize zoning reform.</p>
<p>Moreover, expanding new-home construction by an additional 550,000 units a year for 10 years would create 2.8 million new jobs and generate more than $400 billion in economic activity. NAR and the Rosen Consulting Group&#8217;s “Housing is Critical Infrastructure: Social and Economic Benefits of Building More Housing” report examines the causes of America&#8217;s housing shortage and provides a range of actions that can effectively address this longtime problem.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As members of HGAR, you are a REALTOR®. That REALTOR® mark signifies a member’s commitment to protecting clients, the public and other real estate professionals, as well as to conducting business with integrity and providing high standards of real estate service. It’s a privilege to be able to use that mark. Whether you realize it or not, that trademarked term is protected under federal law and can only be used in certain ways and under certain conditions. So, use it, but use it correctly, because if you don’t, you may find yourself in some trouble with NAR. So, if you’re going to use it, use it correctly.</p>
<p>First, members can only use the mark for the sole purpose of indicating membership with NAR. It cannot be used to connote a profession or title. You can use it connection with your name (Sarah Jones, REALTOR®) or in connection with a brokerage name (Sunshine Realty, REALTORS®), but it cannot be used as part of the name of a brokerage (Sunshine REALTORS®). Further, it cannot be used in connection with the name of a team.</p>
<p>There are three main trademark rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mark must be formatted correctly.</li>
<li> Descriptive words may not be used with the mark.</li>
<li> All uses must tie back to the membership in NAR.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Formatting</strong></p>
<p>Formatting identifies the mark as being special. Always use uppercase lettering with the mark with the trademark symbol (REALTOR®). If that formatting is not possible, you should capitalize the first letter R and add the trademark symbol, or use all uppercase letters without the trademark symbol. The mark should never be in all lowercase, except in a domain name, e-mail address and a social media username due to the inability to capitalize letters. Additionally, the mark must be separated by punctuation (ex: comma, hyphen). There are other exceptions for the mark’s use, such as its use in publications—such as in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> for example—but these initial rules are the big ones you should remember.</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive Words</strong></p>
<p>Words describing the mark cannot be used. This includes geographic descriptors, adjectives and words such as “my,” “your” and “the.”<br />
The following are improper uses of the mark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional REALTORS®</li>
<li>Jane the REALTOR®</li>
<li>www.bestrealtor.com</li>
<li>steve@number1realtor.com</li>
<li>Top Chicago REALTOR®</li>
<li>Hometown REALTOR®</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The “Member Test”</strong></p>
<p>In using the term correctly, you can ensure that you are using it in the proper context by applying the “member test.” The use of the term must convey that it is referencing membership with NAR. To confirm that you’re using it correctly, simply substitute the word “REALTOR®” with “member” or “members of NAR” to determine if it conveys the correct meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many REALTORS® will be there? (Translation: How many members will be there?)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>John Doe is a lawyer and licensed REALTOR®. (Translation: John Doe is a lawyer and licensed member.)</li>
<li>Sunshine Realty: Builders-REALTORS®-Insurers. (Translation Sunshine Realty: Builders-member-insurers).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E-mail Addresses, Domain Names and Usernames</strong></p>
<p>If you’re going to use the mark in an e-mail address, domain name or a username, the aforementioned rules apply with the following two notable exceptions:</p>
<p>The mark can be lowercase; and</p>
<p>Separating punctuation may be omitted.</p>
<p>However, all other rules apply, including the use of “my,” “your,” “the” and other adjectives. Additionally, the mark may only appear next to the member’s personal name/brokerage name or next to the “@” or “.com” extension.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>johndoerealtor@gmail.com</li>
<li>www.sunshinrealtyrealtors.com</li>
<li>@realtorsarah on <em>Instagram</em></li>
<li>robertrealtor@cloudrealty.com</li>
<li>Janerealtor on Facebook</li>
<li>#johndoerealtor on Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>chicagorealtor.com (not next to name; next to descriptive term)</li>
<li>www.yourprofessionalrealtors.com (not next to name; next to descriptive term)</li>
<li>Janetherealtor on Facebook (mark next to the word “the”)</li>
<li>localrealtorsarah@sunshine.com (mark next to descriptive term)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Guidance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot refer to someone who is not a REALTOR® as a non-REALTOR®.</li>
<li>You can display other designations after using the term REALTOR® (ex: John Doe, REALTOR®, GRI, SRES).</li>
<li>You may not use the REALTORS® in a real estate team name.</li>
<li>You cannot use “Best REALTOR®” or “Professional REALTOR®.”</li>
<li>If you have used the mark in your business name, you must take steps to remove it.</li>
<li>You cannot use the mark in connection with programs, activities or charities that a member may participate in, such as a sports team (You can only use the mark in connection with your real estate business).</li>
<li>You can use the mark on merchandise that is distributed, so long as all other guidelines are complied with.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Being a REALTOR® is an honor. The ability to use the term is special, so use it with pride, but use it correctly. You are all REALTORS® and you have earned it.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If it is discovered that a member is misusing the mark, NAR, NYSAR, or HGAR will notify the offending party of the misuse of the mark and require the member to cease that use. If the member fails to comply, a complaint may be filed against the member for violation of their membership duties. NAR may also institute legal action for trademark infringement in state of federal court.</p>
<p>For additional information or question on the use of the mark, contact NAR at <a href="mailto:trademark@nar.realtor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trademark@nar.realtor</a> or at 312-329-8270.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>GOSHEN—“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.”</p>
<p>After a Request for Proposals in 2020 to sell the more than 258-acre Camp LaGuardia property that is located in the villages of Chester and Blooming Grove failed to find a viable buyer, Orange County says it has put the property once again on the market for sale in the form of an RFP. This marks at least the third attempt by the county since it acquired it 15 years ago from New York City to find a buyer/developer for the property that sits adjacent to Route 17 in Southern Orange County.</p>
<p>The county announced on Feb. 14 that it is seeking proposals from developers on the former Camp LaGuardia complex that at one time served as a homeless shelter for New York City. The county has set a deadline of April 15, 2022 for receipt of any property purchase proposals. According to the RFP that was issued on Feb. 14, a site visit is planned for Monday March 28, 2022 at 11 a.m. with a snow/rain date of March 31, 2022 at 11 a.m. According to the RFP, an interested party could seek to acquire the entire Camp LaGuardia property or a certain parcel or parcels.</p>
<p>“As the economy continues to recover and commercial interest in Orange County remains strong, we encourage potential investors to make offers which comply with local zoning and will create job opportunities,” Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus said.</p>
<p>The 258-plus acre Camp LaGuardia campus is adjacent to the Heritage Trail and is close to the Route 17 corridor. There is ample space for a variety of uses in addition to commercial development, county officials stated. In the previous RFP, the county and the villages of Chester and Blooming Grove were not receptive to new residential development on the property. Among the approved zoning designations for the property include commercial, industrial and agricultural uses.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that the county is moving forward to put these properties back on the tax rolls,” said Katie Bonelli, Chairwoman of the Orange County Legislature. “We anticipate proposals which will generate long term revenue for the county and are compatible with local land use requirements.”</p>
<p>The County Legislature will ultimately select the developers who will buy some or all of Camp LaGuardia.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, the county marketed the property and extended the original RFP deadline from Aug. 7. to Sept. 10, and then again to Oct. 8. The marketing campaign to sell Camp LaGuardia included an ad in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> with an “Escape from New York” theme. The Orange County Industrial Development Agency provided the county with $25,000 for marketing and advertising the Camp LaGuardia site. However, those efforts eventually failed to find a viable proposal.</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Neuhaus is confident that the Request for Proposals process will result in the county finding a suitable buyer for the Camp LaGuardia property.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, Neuhaus said that over the years the county has had approximately 10 interested parties that toured the property and each came up with different concepts on how to develop the site.</p>
<p>“The fairest and best way to do it is to put it out to an RFP so that everybody knows exactly what the deadline is to submit their best plan,” he said.</p>
<p>County Executive Neuhaus noted that for the past several years the COVID pandemic had a negative impact on the economy as well as property values. In fact, he revealed that plans for a water park resort at Camp LaGuardia floundered as the pandemic dragged on. While stressing that there will not be any residential development on the property, proposals in the past have included warehouse, theme parks, etc.</p>
<p>He said the county felt that with property values now booming, now is the time to once again solicit proposals for the property and approve a plan that will meet with the approval of both Blooming Grove and Chester.</p>
<p>“We will see some good proposals come out of this and we will see who is real and who is not,”Neuhaus said.</p>
<p>He said that he personally would like to retain a portion of the property, specifically land by the Orange County Heritage Trail for public use.</p>
<p>The County Legislature voted to acquire Camp LaGuardia, a homeless shelter for New York City residents, in 2007. The county attempted to have the Camp LaGuardia property redeveloped and retained Mountco Construction of Scarsdale as the developer, but in 2016 spent approximately $1.3 million to terminate the deal with Mountco, which had proposed a $300-million mixed-use development on the property but failed to secure approvals from affected municipalities to allow the project to break ground.</p>
<p>The Camp LaGuardia property features four parcels totaling 258.3 acres including a 153.5-acre parcel in the Town of Chester; a 40.8-acre parcel in the Town of Chester; a 59.6-acre parcel in the Town of Blooming Grove and a 4.4-acre parcel in the Village of Chester.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In a recent decision,<em> 14 East 4th Street Unit 509 LLC v. Toporek</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/339BzL5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/339BzL5</a>], the Appellate Division, First Department discusses the requirements contained in the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 relating to the landlord’s duty regarding security deposits and landlord’s duty to mitigate damages upon a tenant breach of the lease. This case involved a tenant who breached his lease and vacated an apartment six months prior to the lease’s expiration.</p>
<p>The court in Toporek addressed two specific areas of the 2019 HSTPA: (1) Real Property Law § 227-e [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3sO37yH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3sO37yH</a>] relating to whether the landlord complied with the new requirements under the law regarding mitigation of damages, and (2) the General Obligations Law § 7-108[1-a][b] [see<a href="https://bit.ly/3uFg54b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://bit.ly/3uFg54b</a>] which deals with the requirements of the landlord regarding releasing of the security back to the tenant and a landlord’s right to retain all or part of the security deposit for repairs and/or restoration of the apartment to its original condition.</p>
<p><strong>The Facts of Toporek</strong></p>
<p>The landlord in Toporek owns a luxury 10-unit apartment building. The parties had originally entered into a two-year lease in October 2017. The monthly rent for the first year was $17,500 and $18,000 for the second year. At the expiration of the initial two-year term, they then entered into a one-year renewal at a reduced monthly rent of $17,000. Since the renewal was entered into after the enactment of the HSTPA, the landlord collected one month’s security deposit in accordance with the new law, and this lease was subject to the 2019 HSTPA.</p>
<p>On May 6, 2020, the tenant had not paid May’s rent and the landlord sent an e-mail to tenant regarding the non-payment. The parties then spoke and, thereafter, the landlord “…sent the tenant an e-mail purporting to summarize what was discussed during their call, including that the apartment would be listed on StreetEasy as available for rent on July 1st and that tenant was responsible for ‘making the apartment move in ready condition’ by having it painted, deep cleaned and restored to its original condition. Tenant would also be responsible for the cost of listing the apartment, including any broker&#8217;s fee.” A few days later the tenant notified the landlord that he was terminating the lease and moving out in the beginning of June. The tenant also requested that his security deposit be applied to unpaid May rent. It is important to note that the court pointed out that “[a]n addendum to the renewal lease provide[d] that the ‘[s]ecurity deposit shall not be used by tenant toward any rent,’ which conforms with the new law.” It is important for landlords to include this language in any lease or renewal.</p>
<p>After receiving the communication from the landlord, the tenant informed the landlord “…that he would be getting in contact with [landlord&#8217;s representative], so that [the landlord’s representative] could inspect the apartment and ‘take some video’ to document the process before he would turn the keys over to her.” Thereafter the landlord’s attorney sent correspondence to the tenant “…notifying tenant that he was not allowed to apply the security deposit to his unpaid rent, and his request to terminate the lease prematurely was denied.” The letter also indicated that the tenant would not receive the security deposit back until the landlord was able to inspect the apartment and assess any damage. The attorney also informed the tenant “…that even if he moved out, he would remain responsible for the remaining rent payments due under the lease through October 31, 2020, the end of his lease.”</p>
<p>On June 1st, the tenant notified the landlord that he had already moved out and left the keys at the apartment. The landlord inspected the apartment and on June 3rd landlord’s counsel sent a letter “…referring to tenant&#8217;s request that the building&#8217;s superintendent make repairs to the apartment on his behalf. Although landlord agreed to do so, the letter stated that it would be at tenant&#8217;s expense.” Subsequently, the landlord&#8217;s attorney transmitted additional correspondence to the tenant and informed the tenant the cost of the repairs was $18,442.71, which was $1,442.71 more that the security deposit (i.e., $17,000), and demanded that the tenant pay the difference.</p>
<p>The court also noted that the letter “…was accompanied by an itemized statement describing each item that needed to be repaired, replaced, or cleaned, the estimated cost of doing so, and a color photograph showing the condition alleged. The costliest repair, in excess of $10,600, was to the floors.” Providing the tenant with an itemized statement is a requirement under the 2019 HSTPA. The tenant failed to remit the payment and the landlord, in turn, commenced an action against the tenant. The landlord sued tenant to recover: (1) the $102,000 (which represented the rent owed from May 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, (2) the $1,442.71 (excess due to landlord for the damage to the apartment), and (3) cost of legal fees. The court pointed out that the tenant asserted various defenses, which included landlord’s failure to mitigate the tenant’s damages and that the landlord “wrongfully” retained the tenant’s security deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Landlord’s Duty to Mitigate Damages </strong><strong>Under RPL § 227-e: A Significant </strong><strong>Change in Existing Law</strong></p>
<p>Under Real Property Law § 227-e a landlord now has an “…affirmative duty to mitigate damages where a tenant vacates the premises before the end of the lease.” Section 227-e provides as follows:</p>
<p>“[a] landlord shall, in good faith and according to landlord&#8217;s resources and abilities, take reasonable and customary actions to rent the premises at fair market value or at the rate agreed to during the term of the tenancy, whichever is lower. If landlord rents the premises at fair market value or at the rate agreed to during the term of the tenancy, the new tenant&#8217;s lease shall, once in effect, terminate the previous tenant&#8217;s lease and mitigate damages otherwise recoverable against the previous tenant because of such tenant&#8217;s vacating the premises. The burden of proof shall be on the party seeking to recover damages. Any provision in a lease that exempts a landlord&#8217;s duty to mitigate damages under this section shall be void as contrary to public policy.” [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3sO37yH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3sO37yH</a>]</p>
<p>The court points out that with the passage of Section 227-e, “…the legislature resolved an issue that had plagued the courts, since 1995 when <em>Holy Properties L.P. v Kenneth Cole Prods.</em> (87 NY2d 130 [1995]) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3gBEdMN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3gBEdMN</a>] was decided by the Court of Appeals, holding that there is no duty to mitigate damages in the context of lease agreements.” Although the Holy Properties case involved a commercial lease, “…most courts applied its holding to residential leases as well.” Therefore, until Section 227-e was enacted, in New York, a landlord did not have any duty to mitigate damages if a tenant vacated the premises before the end of the term and failed to pay the rent due through the expiration date of the lease. A landlord was under no obligation to find a new tenant, and could then pursue the tenant for the rent due through the end of the lease term.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Section 227-e only applies to residential leases. With respect to commercial leases, the decision in Holy Properties would still apply and a landlord would have no duty to mitigate damages unless an express provision to the contrary is included in the lease agreement. In Holy Properties, the Court of Appeals held “…that once a tenant abandons the premises before the lease term, ‘landlord [is] within its rights…to do nothing and collect the full rent due under the lease.’”</p>
<p>The court in Toporek further “…clarifies that the doctrine of mitigation of damages is not an affirmative defense to be asserted by a tenant, but rather the burden is on landlord to establish it took reasonable and customary actions to ‘render the injury as light as possible’ (<em>Wilmot v State of New York</em>, 32 NY2d 164, 168 [1973]).” Therefore, the landlord must make sure to document all steps taken to mitigate damages in order to provide the necessary proof in court to preserve its right to collect the remaining rent.</p>
<p>In Toporek, the landlord provided “…[a] sworn affidavit, copies of the lease, the renewal lease, the communications between the parties, the attorney&#8217;s correspondence with tenant, and a copy of the spreadsheet [landlord] prepared documenting the steps [landlord] took to re-rent the apartment after tenant moved out.” The landlord also provided proof that it “…paid for listings of the apartment on multiple online real estate listing platforms, including StreetEasy, Zillow, Trulia and Naked Apartments and the apartment was immediately listed.” Additionally, the landlord provided proof of various showings over several months, and unfortunately was unable to rent the apartment until February, 2021.</p>
<p>The Appellate Division ultimately decided that the landlord “…took reasonable and customary actions to mitigate damages…,” and held that the unpaid rent was due from the tenant. It is important that landlords take “reasonable and customary actions” and begin to market the premises as soon as possible after the tenant vacates the premises in order to preserve its right to recover the remaining rent due through the expiration date of the lease. The court also pointed out that the tenant provided no proof that the steps the landlord took were unreasonable or not customary in the real estate rental industry.</p>
<p><strong>General Obligations Law § 7-108(1-a): Duties Regarding the Security Deposit</strong></p>
<p>The court in Toporek also provides important guidance with respect to General Obligations Law § 7-108(1-a) which was also enacted as part of the 2019 HSTPA. The tenant argued that under Section 7-108(1-a)(d) “…the landlord forfeited its right to retain any portion of his security deposit because it failed to provide him with written notice of his right to request an inspection before he vacated the apartment.” However, the court disagreed and pointed out that a “plain” reading of the statute “…does not mandate forfeiture.” Instead, the court explained that the penalty of a forfeiture of the security deposit only applies when a landlord fails to provide the itemized statement required under General Obligations Law § 7-108(1-a)(e). The court pointed out that the landlord in Toporek did provide the itemized statement.</p>
<p>First, it is important to note that under General Obligations Law § 7-108 (1-a)(b) “…the entire amount of a nonregulated residential tenant&#8217;s security deposit ‘shall’ be returned to tenant, except for amounts lawfully retained for, inter alia, ‘damage caused by tenant beyond normal wear and tear’.” Therefore, once the landlord complies with all of the requirements of Section 7-108(1-a), the landlord may then retain that portion of security deposit required to repair any damage (beyond normal wear and tear) to the premises or to restore the premises to the condition it was in at the beginning of the lease term. If the cost to repair exceeds the security deposit amount then the landlord may retain all of it and recover the balance from the tenant.</p>
<p>Further, as explained by the court, a landlord must, in accordance with General Obligations Law § 7-108 (1-a)(d), “…provide the tenant with written notice of a right to have and be present at an inspection of the premises upon moving out.” Section 7-108(1-a)(d) requires that after either party provides notice to the other of the intention to terminate early (unless tenant terminates with less than two weeks’ notice), landlord shall then notify tenant in writing that tenant has the right to request an inspection, which shall be made no sooner than two weeks, and no later than one week, before the end of the tenancy. Landlord must provide no less than 48 hours’ notice to tenant of the date and time of the inspection. Thereafter, landlord must provide tenant with an itemized statement outlining the repairs, replacements, cleaning, etc. which are required and the cost of same, which would be deducted by tenant’s security deposit. Tenant would then have an opportunity to cure said deficiencies prior to the end of the tenancy or dispute same.</p>
<p>General Obligations Law § 7-108 (1-a)(e), requires that within 14 days after tenant has vacated, landlord shall provide tenant with an itemized statement outlining the basis for the amount of the deposit retained, if any, and shall then also return any remaining portion of the deposit to tenant. The court emphasizes that “if a landlord fails to provide tenant with the statement and deposit within 14 days, landlord shall forfeit any right to retain any portion of the deposit.”</p>
<p>The court points out that subsections (d) and (e) of Section 7-108(a-1) “…collectively provide a blueprint that a landlord must follow before a tenant&#8217;s security deposit can be applied to claimed repairs, by the plain terms of the statute only the obligations in subdivision (e) are subject to a penalty of forfeiture if they are not complied with….” The court further indicates that the only issue in this case that needed to be resolved at a trial was whether the costs for the repairs and/or restoration were reasonable and necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with the 2019 HSTPA is Critical</strong></p>
<p>It is important for all landlords and real estate licensees who engage in residential rentals to understand all of the requirements of the 2019 HSTPA. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the eviction ban in place until recently, many of the cases that would have provided crucial guidance have not made it through the court system. It is important to seek legal counsel before presenting a lease agreement to any tenant because old forms of leases may contain clauses that are no longer valid or permissible under the 2019 HSTPA.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Talk to any Realtor anywhere in the country, and they’ll tell you that even after more than a year, it’s still a seller’s market out there. Layla Boyles, broker/owner at CENTURY 21 Realty Center in Monroe, said she continues to see multiple offers and bidding wars for many Orange County properties, with the average sale now securing 103% of asking price.</p>
<p>In some cases, buyers are so desperate to purchase a home that they’re actually waiving home inspection contingencies or even the entire inspection itself. “This is merely an act of good faith that the buyer really wants the home, but I would never encourage anyone to waive an inspection,” said Boyles. “In some cases, the buyer’s attorney may step in and recommend they do have an inspection.”</p>
<p>Boyles noted that many instances of waived inspections are for homes that appear to be very well maintained and in great condition. “Some buyers will bring a contractor with them when they look at the house to get an idea of what to expect,” she added.</p>
<p>For those clients who have waived inspections, Boyles said luckily none of them have experienced any major problems with the homes they purchased. In other cases, prospective homeowners may hire an inspector but waive any inspection contingencies, so that the purchase deal can go through without the seller having to make any suggested home improvements.</p>
<div id="attachment_39901" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39901" class="wp-image-39901" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_6808.png" alt="" width="281" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-39901" class="wp-caption-text">Termite shelter tubes in a basement (Photo courtesy of Pillar to Post Inspections)</p></div>
<p>“If you’re up against 20 other offers, some buyers may decide to take their chances on the home if they don’t see any obvious problems, but again, forgoing the inspection is not something I would recommend,” said Boyles, who hasn’t had a listing without multiple offers since after COVID started.</p>
<p>Lou Budetti, broker/owner of ERA Insite Realty with offices in White Plains, Bronxville, Pleasantville, Yonkers and Bethel, CT agreed. “The market is still very competitive throughout the Hudson Valley and most sellers are seeking highest and best offers,” he said. In some high-end markets like Chappaqua, he’s seen bidding wars bring in up to $200,000 over asking prices.</p>
<p>Like Boyles, Budetti has seen his share of prospective buyers willing to waive inspections, but also advises against it. “What we’ll suggest is that they do the inspection for informational purposes only, so they know what they’re going to be facing should they end up as the home buyer,” he said. “They can also stipulate that if a home has an older roof or heating system, that the buyer will not ask for a renegotiation of the asking price.”</p>
<p>Budetti said low interest rates and a lack of inventory are continuing to drive the high demand for homes on a national level. “We’ve seen record-setting numbers since the start of COVID,” he noted. “People need more space now for working at home and they’re willing to go a further distance for a home than they once were.”</p>
<p>For buyers who may be considering waiving an inspection, Budetti suggests they need to be concerned with anything structural in the home or something that could affect their health and safety.</p>
<p>Ron Sierra, owner of Pillar to Post Home Inspectors in Rye Brook, warns home seekers to be wary of abandoning home inspections. “It’s really not fair to prospective home owners, because once people close on a home, they inherit every existing problem and then it’s too late,” he cautioned.</p>
<p>A home inspector since 2015, Sierra holds a degree in architectural drafting and design and has more than 20 years of experience in real estate property investment and management. His firm services Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange counties.</p>
<div id="attachment_39899" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39899" class="wp-image-39899" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_2715.png" alt="" width="281" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-39899" class="wp-caption-text">Missing stones and mortar deterioration on the side of a home (Photo courtesy of Pillar to Post Inspections)</p></div>
<p>Sierra noted that termites and other wood-destroying insects can be one of the more serious problems for homes, as well as asbestos and old electric panels. “You have to know what you’re looking for and asbestos can often be found in floor tiles and insulation,” he explained. “If the house has an attic fan, then it can be blowing that all over the place and down the road, family members could have respiratory issues.”</p>
<p>While Sierra admits we’re still in the midst of a seller’s market, he alerts homebuyers to beware of forgoing the inspection process. “I know people can feel pressured with multiple bids and higher offers. It can be intimidating, but knowing what you’re walking into can save you a lot of time and money in the long run,” he said. “In fact, when I bought my home, I hired a home inspector because I wanted a different set of eyes looking it over.”</p>
<p>In some cases, there can be thousands of dollars in hidden costs if a chimney has to be repointed or there are gaps or cracks in the home. Even newly constructed homes are not immune to problems. “A builder is just as good as his subcontractors, and there can be flaws in materials and construction,” added Sierra.</p>
<p>James Carnicelli, civil engineer and owner of Carnell Building and Environmental Inspections in Valhalla, echoed Sierra’s recommendations. “When considering a home purchase, buyers should be aware of any major faulty conditions that could seriously affect their investment,” he said. “Major structural problems like the roof, foundation and grade elevations could be almost impossible to remedy or extremely expensive.”</p>
<p>Other expensive conditions Carnicelli noted include faulty electrical, heating, or plumbing. “The present high inflation and economic insecurities make it mandatory for buyers to beware of potentially high future expenses as well,” he added. Carnell has been serving the Hudson Valley since 1969.</p>
<p>Both Carnicelli and Sierra believe waiving home inspections is just never worth the risk. “Some people spend more time looking for vacation properties or cars than they do looking at a home,” said Sierra. “They should certainly have someone spend the time to really look over what it is mostly likely their largest investment.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Argent Ventures, a privately held New York City-based investment firm, has acquired the twin-tower White Plains Plaza office property here from Ivy Realty of Greenwich, CT and DW Capital of New York City for $105 million. The deal represents the largest single asset office sale in Westchester County since 2010.</p>
<p>The purchase expands Argent’s presence in the White Plains commercial office market. An affiliate of Argent Ventures acquired the more than 906,000-square-foot Westchester One office building at 44 South Broadway in June 2017 for a reported purchase price of more than $126 million from Beacon Capital.</p>
<p>The transaction for White Plains Plaza, which consists of two institutional-quality Class A office buildings (1 North Broadway and 445 Hamilton Ave.) with retail totaling 715,365 square feet, was announced on Feb. 16 but closed several weeks ago. The deal and financing for the purchase was brokered by commercial brokerage firm Newmark.</p>
<p>The property is currently 76% leased to a roster of 74 companies. Among its major tenants include law firms Cuddy &amp; Feder, LLP, Keane &amp; Beane and Carl Zeiss Inc. Ivy and DW Capital transformed the buildings through a $24-million capital investment that created a collaborative work environment featuring new lobbies, outdoor plazas and common areas, and a broad base of amenities.</p>
<p>Newmark&#8217;s Tri-State Capital Markets Executive Managing Director Kevin Welsh, Managing Director Brian Schulz, Director Jason Emrani, and Co-Heads of New York Capital Markets Investment Sales Evan Layne and Brett Siegel and Divisional Head of International Capital Markets Alex Foshay facilitated the sale. Newmark Executive Managing Director Glenn Walsh acted as the team&#8217;s leasing market advisor. Newmark&#8217;s Capital Markets Strategies President Anthony Orso and Senior Managing Director Ari Schwartzbard worked on behalf of Argent to secure the acquisition financing for the sale. No further details on the financing of the transaction were released.</p>
<p>A source close to the deal said the property was put on the market last summer and a tentative purchase deal was reached last fall.</p>
<p>“This market-making transaction demonstrates investor appetite for Class A multi-tenant urban/suburban office properties and illustrates confidence in the long-term future of White Plains,” said Newmark’s Welsh. &#8220;White Plains Plaza was successfully repositioned by the execution of a transformational capital improvement program that created a highly collaborative work environment and powerful market position for the asset. The sale reinforces Argent&#8217;s strategic vision for White Plains as one of the premier mixed-use office markets in the Tri-State.”</p>
<p>Newmark officials pointed to the development pipeline in the City of White Plains as a “multifamily hub” with a number of major multifamily projects planned or underway. They note that once all the planned developments are delivered complete, the CBD population in White Plains has the potential to increase by more than 25%.</p>
<p>Representatives of Argent Ventures could not be reached for comment at press time. Argent at one time owned the Landmark at Eastview biotech campus in Greenburgh and Tarrytown. Argent acquired the 800,000 square foot office/lab campus that included one of the largest development sites in Westchester County from the foreclosing lender and then leased up the existing property and sold it to BioMed Realty Trust in 2004. Argent sold a retail development site to Home Depot in 2006, and sold the remaining 100 acres of adjacent development land to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in 2015.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A panel of real estate executives agreed that the exodus from Manhattan due to COVID-19 is over and that the recovery in the Manhattan luxury housing market has gained momentum that will continue this year.</p>
<p>In addition, the recovery, fueled by a roaring stock market, low interest rates and rapidly declining COVID infection rates, has expanded to the city’s outer boroughs, which are now also seeing increased sales and demand.</p>
<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. (HGAR) and OneKey MLS hosted a virtual panel discussion on Feb. 10 entitled “Getting the Deal Done: Pent-Up Demand – The Rise of Penthouses and High-End Properties.” The program, moderated by Brian D. Tormey, NTP, President of TitleVest, a leading NYC-based provider of title insurance and related real estate services, featured Meris Blumstein, licensed associate real estate broker, The Corcoran Group, NYC; Dana Schulz, editorial director, Marketproof, a NYC-based real estate intelligence and analytics company; and Steve Cohen, associate broker, Douglas Elliman Real Estate, NYC.</p>
<p>“The market definitely softened in the fourth quarter but, right now, we are on par with the first quarter of 2021 and are carrying that momentum into 2022,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of HGAR and President and Chief Strategic Growth Officer of OneKey MLS, the regional multiple listing service for New York.</p>
<p>Haggerty kicked off the discussion with an overview of New York’s market and cited OneKey MLS data to compare pricing trends for single-family houses over the last two years and noted that there was “incredible price growth across the board” in January 2022 over January 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of the northern suburban markets, he said, “In Westchester, we’re seeing a 13% increase in the median sale price; in Sullivan County, it’s 97%, and in Suffolk, where we’ve got The Hamptons, it’s 30%,” Haggerty said. “When you think about what it was like when COVID hit, and how quickly we have recovered, it really is staggering.”</p>
<p>The panel was asked how the rise of the cost per square foot over the past decade is impacting the luxury market and whether the growing percentage of units above $2,000 per square foot would continue or plateau?</p>
<p>“If you look at the history of pricing in New York City, it peaks, flattens and then goes back up above where it peaked before,” said Blumstein of Corcoran. “I expect that will be the case going forward. We’re at a pretty comfortable place, other than with some of the new buildings being priced above $5,000 a square foot. Generally, if you’re priced correctly, you’re getting sold. If you’re priced too high, you’re sitting on the market &#8230; unless it’s something very unique.”</p>
<p>Cohen of Douglas Elliman, agreed. “The right pricing is always important – otherwise a property can simply sit. Particularly in this market. In Manhattan, we’re seeing some bidding wars and we’re potentially getting back to a seller’s market. There is high demand right now and inventory is low, so that’s part of what’s driving it, but properties still have to be priced right,” he said.</p>
<p>Both Blumstein and Cohen agreed that owners of new luxury development projects had been offering concessions during the height of COVID, but have now in light of the low inventory on the market drastically reduced or eliminated concessions all together.</p>
<p>With the current lack of inventory, Blumstein said, “Why should they (building owners) give concessions? I find that there are some new developments that are giving concessions still and there are some that are absolutely not. We are back to the buyers paying the transfer taxes generally or maybe a portion of them. We are back to some kind of stasis, more like the old days of pre-COVID.”</p>
<p>Cohen added that the concessions and price reductions offered at new development properties during the early days of the COVID crisis were the highest in his 22 years in real estate.</p>
<p>He said new luxury building owners no longer need to entice buyers with attractive concessions. “There is demand and a lack of inventory for good product,” Cohen noted.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Haggerty noted that a major issue on the horizon in the New York City housing market is that pre-World War II buildings in Manhattan are facing costly retrofits to comply with city and state green energy and climate change goals or incur hefty fines for not doing so.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the city or the state can afford to just take the approach of financially penalizing these buildings. There is just too much (pre-War) housing stock,” Haggerty said. “I think there has got to be a creative discussion about how the state and the city can actually help some of these older buildings make that transition.”</p>
<p>The panel wrapped up with a look at luxury markets in other boroughs and surrounding areas of New York City. “They, too, are enjoying a bounce-back,” said Schulz of Marketproof.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing these ultra-luxury units spreading across Manhattan so of course that’s going to spill over to the boroughs,” Schulz said, and pointed to new developments like Skyline Tower in Long Island City, which had the most sponsor contracts of any New York City new development property in 2021, and 11 Hoyt in Downtown Brooklyn, which came in second.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing it with the pricing and even the media attention buildings in Brooklyn and Queens are getting,” Schulz added. “Quay Tower in Brooklyn Heights had a $20-million sale and another $10-million sale. And, the new one everyone is talking about—Olympia Dumbo – they have the highest price per square foot, about $2,200, in the borough with a penthouse priced at $19.5 million.”</p>
<p>“Getting the Deal Done” is part of the “Be Your Best” webinar series created by HGAR and OneKey MLS, to help Realtors and agents navigate a changing landscape amid the pandemic. The event was sponsored by TitleVest.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—A panel of commercial real estate brokers from the New York City/Hudson Valley market that were part of a recent virtual panel hosted by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors were upbeat about many sectors in 2022, particularly the industrial, flex, health care and medical office segments.</p>
<p>The region’s office market remains troubled as many businesses and building owners continue to contend with work at home programs and preferences by many employees to engage in hybrid office models that only require working at the office a few days a week. One broker, in particular, predicted some radical changes for the Westchester County office market are on the horizon, while another related that the region’s commercial markets are “facing a new paradigm.”</p>
<p>The HGAR Commercial Investment Division program held on Jan. 27 featured panelists: Paul Adler, Chief Strategy Officer, Rand Commercial; William Cuddy, Executive VP, CBRE; Tom LaPerch, Director, Commercial Group, Houlihan Lawrence Commercial and Kathy Zamechansky, President &amp; Broker, KZA Realty Group. The program was moderated by CID President John Barrett, who is the Managing Director Investment Sales of RM Friedland.</p>
<p>CBRE’s Cuddy said the vacancy rate for the 28-million-square-foot Class A and B sector in Westchester County is 22.6%, which means approximately 6 million square feet currently sits vacant.</p>
<p>Offering a deeper dive on the vacancy, Cuddy noted that approximately 20% of the overall space is categorized as owned-space with no vacancies. “When you eliminate that (owned-space) from the calculation, your vacancy rate is closer to 30%. That is the real story,” Cuddy said.</p>
<p>He continued, “We need to have 2 million square feet of positive net absorption. Now that could be through companies moving out, or changing their office to research and development or medical and we need 2 million square feet to be eliminated from the (county’s office) stock altogether.” Cuddy said that the combination totaling 4 million square feet taken out of the market would bring the county’s office market to equilibrium and would foster price balance for new office construction.</p>
<p>“With what is happening and trending, the discussion about getting to equilibrium wasn’t even possible to have five or 10 years ago,” Cuddy said. “It is a realistic question now and I think it is on the horizon in the next two, three or maybe four years.”</p>
<p>He did note that due to the diversity of the county’s commercial market, there is increasing demand and positive momentum going forward this year, while hospitality and retail continue to struggle.</p>
<p>Rand Commercial’s Adler said it “was the best of times and the worst of times” when it came to which segments of the Hudson Valley’s commercial market performed well or poorly in 2021.</p>
<p>He said the industrial and flex markets were “hot to the touch” and the medical office segment also experienced an uptick in activity, despite the pandemic. While the office market struggled last year, he said there are great opportunities that now exist in the land development sector.</p>
<p>“What COVID and now the Omicron variant and whatever comes after that have taught the retail market, the commercial markets is that they have to deal with the new paradigm,” Adler said. “It is not going to go back. We need to go forward in a very different way and I think we are seeing the smart landlords, owners and developers gearing themselves to understanding that COVID is not going away.”</p>
<p>He said that while COVID eventually may be treated differently, perhaps similar to the flu where people receive one shot a year, the public has changed their lifestyle in response to COVID. For example, he said, “I don’t know if people believe they really have to be in the office five days a week anymore.”</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence’s LaPerch said that COVID has opened up a number of different opportunities for real estate investors and users. Due in part to the exodus from New York City that provided a major lift to the residential market in Northern Westchester and the Hudson Valley, LaPerch said that there is strong demand and activity for logistics centers, e-commerce operations as well as second-generation restaurants.</p>
<p>“The northern area (of Westchester and Putnam counties) has arrived along I-84 and even north of that,” LaPerch said. “We are seeing even in the towns that were kind of bypassed for development, because of the COVID influx of people coming through…they are starting to be found for opportunities.”</p>
<p>KZA Realty Group’s Zamechansky said the Bronx’s industrial market was very busy in 2021, despite the coronavirus and activity remains strong so far this year.</p>
<p>She noted that because many Bronx residents do not utilize e-commerce venues as much as others outside of the borough, conventional bricks and mortar retail in the Bronx is thriving. Zamechansky noted that retail hubs at Fordham Road, Pelham Parkway, White Plains Road, Burnside Avenue, Jerome Avenue and Bay Plaza were all quite active last year.</p>
<p>“I think we are going to do pretty good in 2022,” she said. “I am optimistic.”</p>
<p><strong>National Outlook for Commercial Improves</strong></p>
<p>The HGAR commercial panel’s mostly upbeat view of most segments of the commercial market in the Bronx and Hudson Valley region mirrors those of Cushman &amp; Wakefield on the national level.</p>
<p>Kevin Thorpe, chief economist for C&amp;W during the brokerage firm’s webinar entitled “Nearing the Other Side of the Pandemic—What’s Next?” said, “We see momentum on the other side of this. The economic data remains very strong. The economy is creating lots of jobs and demand for property is strengthening across most markets and what we are learning is that the commercial real estate sector and the broader economy are becoming more resilient to these (COVID) outbreaks and each wave has been followed by a surge of activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued, “As Omicron fades, the commercial real estate sector, which actually started to boom last year, in our view is poised to take off again.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[More Americans are likely to own a home now than during any year following the Great Recession (65.4% homeownership rate in 2010); however, Black Americans continue to face significant obstacles along the path to homeownership, according to the National Association of Realtors.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The U.S. homeownership rate climbed to 65.5% in 2020, up 1.3% from 2019 and the largest annual increase on record. More Americans are likely to own a home now than during any year following the Great Recession (65.4% homeownership rate in 2010); however, Black Americans continue to face significant obstacles along the path to homeownership, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>The homeownership rate for Black Americans – 43.4% – trails behind that of a decade ago (44.2% in 2010). Conversely, White Americans (72.1%), Asian Americans (61.7%) and Hispanic Americans (51.1%) all achieved decade-long highs in homeownership in 2020, with the rate for Hispanic Americans setting a record and reaching above 50% for the first time.</p>
<p>The homeownership rate for New York State for White Americans is 66%, while the Black Americans homeownership rate in the Empire State is 35%.</p>
<p>NAR&#8217;s 2022 Snapshot of Race and Home Buying in America report examines homeownership trends and challenges by race and location to explain current racial disparities in the housing market. Using data from the 2021 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, the report looks at the characteristics of who purchases homes, why they purchase, what they purchase and the financial background for buyers based on race.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-39992" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NAR-OWNERSHIP-PIC-2-1024x576.jpg?_t=1645641628" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NAR-OWNERSHIP-PIC-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View larger image</a>)</p>
<p>“As the gap in homeownership rates for Black and White Americans has widened, it is important to understand the unique challenges that minority home buyers face,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR vice president of demographics and behavioral insights. “Housing affordability and low inventory has made it even more challenging for all buyers to enter into homeownership, but even more so for Black Americans.”</p>
<p>Housing affordability has eroded for many consumers since the start of the pandemic due to the combination of record-high home prices and record-low inventory. Since 2019, home prices have spiked 30%—or about $80,000 for a typical home, while housing inventory has declined to under one million units available for sale. Approximately half of all homes currently listed for sale (51%) are affordable to households with at least $100,000 income.</p>
<p>Nationwide, nearly half of all Asian households annually earn more than $100,000. However, 35% of White households, 25% of Hispanic households and only 20% of Black households have incomes greater than $100,000. NAR&#8217;s analysis found that the most affordable states for Black households to purchase a home are Maryland, West Virginia, Kansas, Ohio and Indiana. Conversely, the least affordable states for Black households are Utah, Oregon, California, Nevada and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>In terms of renter households, half of Black Americans spend more than 30% of their monthly income on rent. Almost three out of 10 Black renter households (28%) and one in five White renter households (20%) are severely cost-burdened—defined as spending more than 50% of monthly income on rent. Nationwide, NAR estimates that 47% of White renter households and 36% of Black renter households can afford to buy a typical home when comparing the qualifying income to purchase a home and the median income of renter households.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-39993" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NAR-OWNERSHIP-PIC-3-1024x576.jpg?_t=1645641628" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(<a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NAR-OWNERSHIP-PIC-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View larger image</a>)</p>
<p>“Black households not only spend a bigger portion of their income on rent, but they are also more likely to hold student debt and have higher balances,” Lautz added. “This makes it difficult for Black households to save for a down payment and as a result, they often use their 401(k) or retirement savings to enter homeownership.”</p>
<p>Black households (41%) are more than twice as likely as Asian households (18%) and nearly twice as likely as White households (22%) to have student loan debt. Approximately a quarter of Hispanic households (26%) reported having student loan debt. The median student loan debt for Black households ($45,000) exceeded that of Hispanic ($35,500), White ($30,000) and Asian ($24,400) households. Student debt is often a major impediment for prospective home buyers in saving for a down payment. Black and Hispanic applicants (7% each) were rejected for mortgage loans at greater rates than White and Asian applicants – 4% and 3%, respectively.</p>
<p>Black Americans (14%) and Hispanic Americans (12%) were at least twice as likely than White Americans (6%) to tap into their 401(k) or pension funds as a down payment source for a home purchase. Such actions can diminish future wealth growth. Conversely, almost four out of 10 White Americans (38%) used the funds from the sale of their primary residence to serve as a down payment for a home compared to only 25% of Hispanic, 21% of Black and 16% of Asian Americans.</p>
<p>The study noted that for those who said they witnessed or experienced discrimination in a real estate transaction, nearly a third of Black respondents (32%) said they faced stricter requirements because of their race. That compares to 19% of White respondents, 16% of Hispanic respondents and 4% of Asian respondents. Approximately one-third of Black and White home buyers (32% each) and almost a quarter of Hispanic home buyers (23%) said they witnessed or experienced discrimination with the type of loan product offered.</p>
<p>Approximately seven in 10 White Americans (69%) said they purchased a home in a neighborhood where the majority of the residents were of the same race. However, about a quarter of Hispanic Americans (26%) and less than a fifth of Black (17%) and Asian Americans (15%) said the same.</p>
<p>NAR is working to ensure Realtors are active leaders in the fight to close the racial homeownership gap. NAR serves on the steering committee of the Black Homeownership Collaborative whose seven-point plan aims to increase Black homeownership by a net 3 million by 2030. NAR has also stepped up the real estate industry&#8217;s efforts to end bias and discrimination. Its &#8220;ACT&#8221; plan emphasizes &#8220;Accountability, Culture Change, and Training&#8221; to advance fair housing in the industry. NAR&#8217;s interactive training platform, Fairhaven, puts real estate professionals in simulated situations where discrimination in a real estate transaction can occur. Also, NAR&#8217;s implicit bias video and classroom trainings offer strategies to help Realtors override biases in their daily interactions.</p>
<p>To increase the nation&#8217;s housing inventory, NAR is advocating that all levels of government include funding for affordable housing construction; preserve, expand and create tax incentives to renovate distressed properties; convert unused commercial space to residential units; and encourage and incentivize zoning reform. Moreover, expanding new-home construction by an additional 550,000 units a year for 10 years would create 2.8 million new jobs and generate more than $400 billion in economic activity.</p>

<p>The first one involves our recent strategic planning session and we have decided to rename our Strategic Plan “The Opportunity Plan.” We felt that the word “strategic” was daunting to the average member and we wanted to make it more welcoming. The new Opportunity Plan is a customizable journey for the membership. So, any member can decide what their pathway is—it doesn’t have to be becoming the next NYSAR President. It can be serving on Housing and Opportunities (Committee) or working with the REALTOR Party. So, they can choose their own pathway and be involved as much as they want to.</p>
<p>In relation to my next goal, we are really happy to be working in what is now a hybrid world. At our Mid-Winter Business Meeting we were able to meet in person for the first time in two years and I really feel that people needed it. They were Zoomed out. Some people who didn’t feel safe had the opportunity to stay home and were able to watch the meeting via livestream. Our Board of Directors meeting was a hybrid session where members were able to Zoom and be heard. So, that was excellent. But, I felt that in talking with everyone their tanks were filled and that they just needed to see their fellow Realtors and be able to commiserate about what we had been through and really get the sense that we are all in this together and we all have been going down similar paths and that it is OK and we are all going to get through this. … The overall feeling I got is that everyone was so happy to be able to receive information in person because with so many Zooms over the past couple of years, and with multi-tasking, they just zone out sometimes.</p>
<p>The most important goal I have is to stress that NYSAR has the best Government Affairs Department. It is second to none in the nation. It is just incredible. But, I think they do a very bad job of touting their accomplishments. If you know Mike Kelly (NYSAR Director of Government Affairs), he is a very humble man. I don’t think he sleeps. He does more in a day than most people accomplish in a week. He just has his finger on the pulse of the State Legislature and in turn he is so well respected (by state lawmakers). So, with that being said, what we are doing this year is we are producing a video series and I just met with Mike yesterday and we did two new three-to-five-minute videos updating membership on advocacy efforts.</p>
<p>The first one we did (earlier) was on the nine Fair Housing bills that came out (and were recently signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul) and broke them down into segments that the membership could understand because these bills can get very technical. The videos let them know what is the practical purpose of these bills and how do they affect us? … It has been very well received. The videos we did yesterday were a recap of what we talked about at the Mid-Winter Business Meetings and we also talked about good cause eviction.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> In this upcoming legislative session, what measures would you like to see passed into law?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-40008" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Vucetic-6.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="222" />Vucetic:</strong> Legislation correcting the current ban on telemarketing during any state of emergency. Also, a bill that would provide increased predictability and transparency in the purchase of a co-op and increased funding for affordable/workforce housing, along with increased broadband.</p>
<p>I have to go back and say that I was very happy that we were able to work collaboratively with the legislators on the nine Fair Housing bills that were passed. I think that was a big win for us. What was uncovered in the<em> Newsday</em> article was very hard to digest. Out of all of that I think it was a very well-done, teachable moment for us. The fact that we were asked to have a seat at the table and participate in the creation of these Fair Housing bills really was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What proposals currently under consideration by state lawmakers would damage the real estate industry in New York State and hurt consumers?</p>
<p><strong>Vucetic:</strong> So-called “Good Cause” Eviction legislation would do tremendous harm to housing providers that have already experienced tremendous challenges over the last two years from non-payments of rent to eviction moratoriums.</p>
<p>Seven days into my presidency I had the privilege of testifying before the State Senate in opposition to Good Cause Eviction. The name betrays what it actually is. There is nothing good about Good Cause Eviction. Basically, it is taking the rights of property owners away from them and forcing them to take time out of their days where they might have another job, and go to the courts and get permission to affect change on their property. There are six grounds that would qualify under “Good Cause,” however, we know there are a lot of things that occur that we know of that would not necessarily fall under that and you would still have to go before a judge and plead your case…</p>
<p>We preach that the easiest way to create wealth is through real estate and property ownership. This Good Cause Eviction proposal is forcing the Mom and Pop owners out of business. You have these big conglomerates and big groups that hold properties and budget the funds for vacancies and budget for repairs. They have the funding and the ability to pay for them. When you have a Mom and Pop owner or a first-time investor, they are probably running on a very slim budget. They may have had to put 20% down because they have a residence and this is an investment for them. So, they probably don’t have the capital behind them and when you have a tenant that is habitually late paying their rent, it makes them (the owner) late on their mortgage payment and that affects their ability to purchase in the future. Editor’s Note: NYSAR President Vucetic also noted that another impact on small property owners is the inability to raise rents appropriately to cover repair or replacement costs.</p>
<p>Good Cause Evictions are really pushing the small investor out of the market just because they don’t want to have the exposure of having a tenant not paying their rent and the fact that they cannot evict them.</p>
<p>Also, while not in bill form yet, we will be closely watching the recommendations from the New York State Climate Action Council, which could have far reaching impacts on housing as New York State tries to reduce the use of fossil fuels and reach certain emission standards.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The NYSAR President also said the association is having discussions concerning New York State’s ambitious timeline to move away from fossil fuels to green energy sources and a proposal to ban natural gas oil and propane fuel from all new construction.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Do you believe the real estate industry needs to do more in terms of Fair Housing and Diversity and is NYSAR engaged in any programs to educate Realtors to promote the principles of Fair Housing and Diversity in their business practices?</p>
<div id="attachment_40006" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40006" class="wp-image-40006" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Vucetic-4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="280" /><p id="caption-attachment-40006" class="wp-caption-text">NYSAR, NYSAR Instillation, NYSAR 2022, Desmond Hotel, Albany</p></div>
<p><strong>Vucetic:</strong> So, yes, yes and yes. Once again, I truly believe that <em>Newsday</em>’s “Long Island Divided” series was a gift. … One of the incredible things about the story was that there were (Realtors) from protected classes who were guilty of violating Fair Housing and they admittedly said they would never do it because it happened to them and here they are on video doing it. So, I think that is a lesson to all of us that we do have unconscious bias and we can do better and we need to do better.</p>
<p>Nationally (through the National Association of Realtors) we have At Home with Diversity designation, Fair Housing Training (Fair Haven) and Implicit Bias training and we have been pushing those three things for everyone to do. However, at our last set of meetings, we really opened up and had roundtable discussions about race and real estate and we had some pretty raw conversations and it was excellent to hear from protected classes and their experiences as Realtors. … We were really fortunate to have representation from all across New York State and hear how it is to be a minority in real estate and the challenges that they face.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> NYSAR has been working with NAR, HGAR’s Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Officer Freddimir Garcia and others on Fair Housing and Diversity and will be rolling out its own initiatives later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> With interest rates rising and COVID infections on the decline in New York State in early 2022, how do you see the real estate market in the state performing this year?</p>
<p><strong>Vucetic:</strong> I have been doing this for a while and I have lived through a couple of different cycles, what really concerns me about this is that traditionally the average price of a house in a market is $200,000. The buyer gets approved for $225,000. They would only buy at about the $200,000 price point because they were being conservative, although they were approved for more. With the lack of inventory for the last couple of years and people losing out repeatedly on multiple offer (situations)—four, five or six times—they go back to the bank and say how much can you get me? So, the banks say, ‘Ok, we can stretch you to $250,000.” Then they get to $250,000 and then beg, borrow and steal to get an extra $15,000 from a retirement account or a family member and now they are at $265,000. There is no equity left. They knew they could pay the mortgage payment. They budgeted for that. What they didn’t budget for is home heating fuel going up 20% and electricity doubling where your bill was $200, now it is $400. Everything has gone up and they did not take that into account that the cost of living would go up as high as it has.</p>
<p>I think we are going to see people struggling to stay in their homes. Whether interest rates go up or not, I see people sitting tight because they know inflation is going higher and now they will not be in such a hurry to buy a house. I definitely see an increase in short sales because some people will have difficulty paying their mortgage. They are going to be struggling.</p>
<p>What we went through (during COVID) was not sustainable and I feel that Realtors feel very beat up after the last two years. We had to work three times as hard to get someone into a house and we didn’t feel good about it because we felt they may have overpaid. And even if you were the listing agent, you had to call 10 of your fellow Realtors and tell them they lost out on a multiple offer and that doesn’t feel good either. We all just got really beaten down by this the last couple of years and I think everyone is just looking forward to a return to a more stabilized market.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. believes work could begin as early as this April on its $1.394-billion “Loop Road” expansion project in the Town of Greenburgh if the company secures necessary incentives from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency and other sources totaling approximately $172.9 million and another $100 million in other public incentives.</p>
<p>The Tarrytown-based company’s proposed project in Westchester County received a major boost on Friday, Feb. 25 when the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency in a unanimous 7-0 vote approved the preliminary inducement of the sought-after sales tax and real property tax incentives for Regeneron.</p>
<p>Regeneron representatives noted that the company is also considering unspecified sites in New Jersey for the expansion project. At the session, Regeneron officials noted that the biopharmaceutical company had already begun construction on its Parcel D expansion project at its headquarters campus property in Greenburgh that is valued at $480 million, which secured incentives from the Westchester County IDA last year. The Parcel D project involves the construction of a new two-story, 207,000-square-foot building, along with a parking structure and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Loop Road expansion project would be an additional expansion involving the construction of eight new buildings, three parking garages and a central utility plant totaling approximately 724,000 square feet at 777 OId Saw Mill River Road. The development would be located on a portion of the 100 acres the company acquired for $72 million in 2015.</p>
<p>Therefore, the company’s expansion projects could total 921,000 square feet of space and a total investment of $1.87 billion.</p>
<p>The proposed Loop Road capital investment would serve to locate and staff multiple new R&amp;D laboratories, administrative buildings, and amenities. Regeneron, which currently employs more than 3,300 full time employees at its corporate headquarters facilities in Tarrytown, stated that the project would retain 250 jobs at its campus property in Greenburgh, Mount Pleasant and Tarrytown and add another 700 new jobs at the property.</p>
<p>The construction of the project will result in approximately 2,500 construction jobs. In connection with the project, a study commissioned by the Westchester County IDA estimates that the construction project would generate $208.8 million in direct spending in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Regeneron, in its filings with the IDA, noted that “there is considerable interest” in expanding at the Westchester site, it is also considering less-costlier alternative sites in New Jersey. “The recent consolidation within the life sciences industry sector has made multiple real estate options with existing buildings available throughout the state. The estimated cost to locate Regeneron’s proposed facilities and new workforce in New Jersey over a 10-year period is significantly lower than the Tarrytown greenfield option. New Jersey also presents an attractive answer from a qualified labor pool perspective. Given Regeneron’s sizeable local workforce, the majority of which are New York residents, identifying, recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and training new employees is becoming more difficult and costly. New Jersey presents an advantage in this regard—the state has the highest concentration of scientists and engineers in the country and the fourth largest share of STEM graduates,” Regeneron stated.</p>
<p>The company later stated in filings with the IDA, “Given these considerations, if Applicant is unable to obtain Agency Financial Assistance for the proposed project, it will not materialize in New York. Wherever this project is ultimately located will likely become home to future expansion activity of a similar nature.”</p>
<p>Regeneron stated that if all approvals are secured and its selects Westchester for the Loop Road expansion, the acquisition of equipment could begin in April with site work on the property commencing between April and June of this year. Project completion on the phased project is estimated for Dec. 31, 2027. The project has secured approval from the Town of Greenburgh’s Planning Department.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer said of Regeneron’s planned investment and the IDA’s actions, “This investment is one of the most major developments we have seen in Westchester County in recent history. Regeneron has been on the cutting edge of the bioscience industry. We are pleased the IDA can be a significant part of it. We are proud Regeneron has chosen Westchester County as their home.”</p>
<p>A public hearing on Regeneron’s proposed Loop Road project must be held before the Westchester County IDA can finalize the approval of the incentives for Regeneron. The next Westchester County IDA meeting is scheduled for Thursday, March 24.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>NANUET—Rockland County Executive Ed Day signed on March 3 a bill amending the county’s existing cooperative application decision law to require co-op boards to disclose the reason or reasons for a denial of a prospective buyer’s application.</p>
<p>After a public hearing, the Rockland County Legislature passed the amendment to the “Timely Co-Op Application Decision Law” by a 13-0 margin on Feb. 16. The measure was introduced by Legislators Alden H. Wolfe, Jay Hood, Harriet D. Cornell, Toney L. Earl, Michael M. Grant, Aney Paul, Philip Soskin, Aron B. Weider and Itamar J. Yeger.</p>
<p>The measure will take effect 90 days after it is filed with the New York State Secretary of State by the Rockland County Legislature.</p>
<p>Once the amendment goes into effect, Rockland County will now require cooperative applications to disclose the following:</p>
<p>1) All applicable related timelines.<br />
2) Any minimum financial qualifications that a prospective applicant must meet to qualify.<br />
3) If a housing cooperative does not have any mandatory financial qualifications under subparagraph (B), the housing cooperative must provide, at a minimum, the housing cooperative’s preferred minimum income, total assets, and credit score and preferred debt-to-income and percentage of purchase price being financed, noting that the governing board may exercise discretion in weighing factors when making its final determination on an application.</p>
<p>In terms of rejections, the amended law now requires:</p>
<p>A. In the case of a rejection, the written notice provided by the housing cooperative to the applicant shall include sufficient detail to fully inform the applicant of the reason or reasons for rejection, including, but not limited to, the reason or reasons the applicant did not meet the minimum financial qualifications and/or any other determinative factors.</p>
<p>B. Rejection of an applicant based on discrimination, as defined in Sect. 261-2 of the Rockland County Fair Housing Law, is prohibited and any aggrieved person may file a claim pursuant to Sect. 261-3 of the FHL.</p>
<p>C. Rejection of an application after failure to provide the required disclosures, pursuant to Sect. 289-12, may constitute prima facia evidence of discrimination in a claim filed under Sect. 261-3 of the FHL.</p>
<p>In February 2018, the Rockland County Legislature passed unanimously a bill that requires co-op boards to make a timely decision on applications by prospective buyers.</p>
<p>That bill, sponsored by Legislator Wolfe, requires a co-op board to provide written notice to the applicant of its decision within 45 days of the receipt of a fully completed purchase application. If the co-op board fails to act on that application within the mandated 45-day period, the application will be deemed approved.</p>
<p>Other key provisions of that legislation that is now law in Rockland County include that if the application is deemed incomplete, the co-op has 10 days to notify the applicant in writing and explain what is required to render the application complete.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> reported back in 2018 that the reform bill affected an estimated 2,644 units of housing on 20 parcels in Suffern, Spring Valley, Hillcrest and Garnerville.</p>
<p>“Rockland County residents have the right to know the rationale behind the denial or approval of a co-op application and I fully believe this amendment will ensure these transactions remain transparent and prevent discriminatory acts from taking place,” said County Executive Ed Day on the co-op law amendment.</p>
<p>County Legislator Wolfe, a practicing real estate attorney, said that he and other legislators including Chairman Hood, who is also a real estate attorney, believed back in 2018 that an incremental approach to the co-op disclosure issue was warranted. He added that the introduction of the amendment this year was based on input legislators received from stakeholders since the original bill went into law more than four years ago.</p>
<p>“I think that once you step into the shoes of the purchaser of a co-op unit or a prospective purchaser of a co-op unit, you can understand the frustration of someone who might otherwise be qualified but denied,” Wolfe said. He added that legislators felt the amendment might shed some light on the cooperative purchase process “and at the end facilitate smooth real estate transactions.”</p>
<p>HGAR CEO Richard Haggerty said of the new co-op purchase disclosure requirement in Rockland County, “Cooperative disclosure is a very serious issue and we at HGAR are very pleased with the actions taken by Rockland County Board of Legislators and County Executive Day in signing the amendment into law. Their actions will ensure transparency and compliance with fair housing laws in the purchase of cooperatives in Rockland County will be integral parts of the process going forward. This is a victory for consumers and Realtors alike.”</p>
<p>The passage of the Rockland co-op bill amendment is another legislative victory for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors’ advocacy efforts geared at enacting legislation to enhance transparency and anti-discriminatory measures in connection with the purchase of cooperative housing in the region. HGAR and its predecessor organizations engaged in a nearly three-decade effort to enact co-op disclosure legislation in Westchester County. The Westchester County Board of Legislators in a 15-2 vote on June 28, 2021 approved an amendment to the existing Co-Op Disclosure Law that requires a cooperative Board of Directors to provide a reason for a denial of an applicant seeking to purchase a unit at their property. The measure went into effect immediately as Westchester County Executive George Latimer later that evening signed the bill into law.</p>
<p>Leah Caro, HGAR Legislative Committee Co-Chair said, “I applaud the Rockland County Legislators and County Executive for amending their co-op law to include a written reason for co-op board declinations. The previous law, which helped to remedy the time-frame issues that plagued sellers and buyers, didn’t go far enough to prevent systemic discrimination. The new law is such an important step in combatting housing discrimination. Many people would like to see big, sweeping laws that address all the parts of an issue, but sometimes it takes baby steps to get there. I’m glad the Legislators and Executive took the steps.”</p>
<p>Barry Kramer, Broker-Owner of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Choice Realty, who has been a longtime advocate for co-op purchase reform, said, &#8220;The passage of new legislation to bring increased transparency in co-op transactions to Rockland County continues our momentum to bring fairness to the co-op buying process. We&#8217;ve seen legislation pass in Long Island and Westchester so I commend the Rockland Legislature and County Executive Ed Day for their support. Fair Hosing initiatives have touched nearly every aspect of buying and selling real estate. Hopefully these county initiatives will bring legislation state-wide to further transparency in co-op purchases.&#8221;</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TARRYTOWN—One of the most recognizable hotel properties in Westchester County—the Westchester Marriott—has changed hands in a $40-million transaction.</p>
<p>New York City-based Taconic Capital Advisors, HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts of Norwalk, CT partnered to acquire the Westchester Marriott, a 444-key hotel in Tarrytown, from Ares Commercial Real Estate Corp. of New York City for $40 million. As part of the transaction announced on March 11, Ares Commercial is providing a financing facility in support of the new ownership’s business plan for the hotel property.</p>
<p>The 15-acre property, located at 670 White Plains Road, offers 21 event rooms for a total of 26,700 square feet of conference and meeting space, including a 9,000-square foot ballroom with a total capacity of 1,100 people. The property includes a Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Cooper Mill American restaurant, a gift shop, fitness center, spa and laundry.</p>
<p>The hotel will continue to operate under the Marriott flag and will be managed by HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts. Taconic and HEI will execute a comprehensive $30-million case and soft goods renovation focused on all areas of the hotel. The Westchester market has lost nearly 1,200 directly competitive hotel rooms during the last several years, including more than 90,000 square feet of meeting space.</p>
<p>“The Westchester Marriott provides a unique opportunity in a time of continued and permanent market supply reduction,” said Andrew Lam, director with Taconic. “A property of this caliber, with a transformative renovation and new best-in-class management, is positioned to excel.”</p>
<p>“When sourcing this deal, HEI recognized the opportunity to execute a business plan that will maximize real estate value by relying on the company’s proven track record for successful repositioning,” said HEI CEO Anthony Rutledge. “We are excited to team with Taconic as we reenergize this asset.”</p>
<p>This is Taconic’s first acquisition with HEI and marks the company’s 12th hotel transaction, encompassing 17 properties and 3,700 keys, in the past year.</p>
<p>HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts is one of the nation’s leading privately held hotel investment and third-party management companies, with a portfolio of 90-plus properties in the United States.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to enter into this agreement in support of Taconic’s and HEI’s business plans for the Westchester Marriott,” said Bryan Donohoe, Chief Executive Officer of ACRE. “We believe the collaboration of Taconic and HEI and their demonstrated capabilities will enable the property to thrive in the evolving Westchester market.”</p>
<p>The Westchester Marriott was sold in June 2007 in a deal that sources estimated at the time was at approximately $65 million. Northview Hotel Group LLC of Westport, CT acquired the Westchester Marriott from Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley had implemented approximately $11 million in upgrades to the hotel in the previous two years.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Back in <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/viewpoints/barristers-briefing-good-intentions-paving-the-way-to-hell-love-letters-and-escalation-clauses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020 I authored an article regarding buyers sending personal letters</a>, otherwise known as “love letters” to sellers. The purpose of that article was to highlight the potential discriminatory use of those letters. At that time, the <em>Newsday</em> article “Long Island Divided” and its investigation into discrimination was still fresh, and the National Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors were both discouraging the use of personal letters. Today, recent developments prompt me to again warn that the use of such letters can be dangerous to licensees and their clients.</p>
<p><strong>New Oregon Law</strong></p>
<p>In September 2021, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed into law a bill thats  intent was to curb discrimination in the sale of real estate by banning the use of personal letters. At its core was the historic concern of discrimination, whether conscious or unconscious, of protected classes (i.e., race, color, religion, national origin, etc.). At that time, one proponent and real estate licensee said, “…the practice of providing love letters perpetuates systemic issues of bias in real estate transactions.” He added that “love letters” could perpetuate “implicit biases that we’re not even aware of.”</p>
<p>As a result, the bill stated that:</p>
<p><em>In order to help a seller avoid selecting a buyer based on the buyer&#8217;s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or familial status as prohibited by the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), a seller&#8217;s agent shall reject any communication other than customary documents in a real estate transaction, including photographs, provided by a buyer. (Or. Rev. Stat. § 696.805(7).)</em></p>
<p>While the statute did not prohibit the buyer and seller from directly communicating their thoughts, the statute prohibited agents from such communications. Further, while the statute did not define “customary documents” Oregon’s Real Estate Commissioner specifically stated that “love letters” were not “customary documents.”</p>
<p><strong>The Lawsuit for Violation of First Amendment Free Speech Rights</strong></p>
<p>As a result of this law being enacted, an Oregon real estate brokerage filed suit, asserting that the law was a violation of its, as well as its client’s, First Amendment rights to free speech. (<em>Total Real Estate Grp. v. Strode</em>, 3:21-cv-01677-HZ (D. Or. Mar. 3, 2022)).</p>
<p><strong>Request for a Preliminary Injunction and the Judge’s Decision</strong></p>
<p>As an initial matter, the plaintiffs wanted an immediate temporary stay on the enforcement of the law. Without going into the minutia, the judge went through the process of weighing all the factors related to the ability of the plaintiffs to bring the matter on behalf of real estate licensees and their clients, as well as the factors related to imposing restrictions on commercial free speech rights, and determined that the legislation was overly broad and not reasonably tailored to resolving the problem it sought to remedy and that the First Amendment rights of free speech outweighed the restrictions imposed. Further, the judge hinted at the possibility that the legislation was void as being too vague; however, he did not base his ruling on that factor.</p>
<p>As a result of that analysis, last week the court granted plaintiffs’ motion and temporarily stopped defendants (Oregon’s Real Estate Commissioner and the Attorney General for the State of Oregon’s Department of Justice) from enforcing the law. That preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the entry of a final judgment. According to plaintiffs’ counsel, that decision “preserves the opportunity of homebuyers to speak freely to sellers and make the case why their purchase offers should win out. Love letters communicate information that helps sellers select the best offer. The state cannot ban important speech because someone might misuse it.”</p>
<p>While the case is not over, the question is now whether the state will appeal the decision or if they will try to amend the law. If there is no appeal, plaintiffs will probably file a motion for Summary Judgment, which may put an end to the case.</p>
<p><strong>Use of ‘Love Letters’ vs. Free Speech</strong></p>
<p>While this case was a victory for free speech, the question remains whether the use of personal letters helps and whether brokerages should promote or discourage their use.</p>
<p>According to studies identified in the lawsuit, the use of personal letters can help a buyer’s offer get accepted. However, another study showed that nearly 93% of those personal letters provided some information that identified the buyer as a protected class. When a buyer provides protected class information and it is used against them, that’s discrimination. If there’s an agent helping to write or passing along that information, whether seller or buyer’s, then that agent is also part of that discrimination plan and they, along with their brokers, could be subject to a lawsuit and loss of licensure.</p>
<p>Since 2020, NAR and NYSAR have openly discouraged personal letters because of these inherent dangers of potential discrimination. They have advocated that Realtors not assist in writing, delivering, or receiving such letters. HGAR has also warned about the use of personal letters, as the misuse of this information can have a severe and far-reaching impact.</p>
<p><strong>Fall Out and Fair Housing and Brokerages</strong></p>
<p>The intentions of the State of Oregon were laudable: they were trying to redress fair housing discrimination. However, as the judge noted, the state “could have addressed the problem of housing discrimination without infringing on protected speech to such a degree.”</p>
<p>Whether Oregon amends its law remains to be seen. However, other states, such as Rhode Island, are now looking to draft similar laws.</p>
<p>So where does that leave Realtors? By following the guidance of NAR and NYSAR, a brokerage stands the best chance of insulating itself from claims of discrimination and fair housing violations. Short of that, a brokerage should establish detailed policies on the use of personal letters and how they are to be employed.</p>
<p><strong>NAR’s Position on Love Letters</strong></p>
<p>While “love letters” may seem harmless, they often reveal information about buyers, such as their race and national origin, which can pose fair housing risks. That information could be used, knowingly or because of unconscious bias, to unlawfully accept or reject an offer. NAR continues to stress that all parties in a real estate transaction should consider only pertinent criteria when making business decisions. Failing to do so could also leave Realtors in a compromised position. We also recommend our members explain potential pitfalls to their clients while stressing the importance of sticking to objective criteria in order to adhere to federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s that time of the year again—tax season! It is an important time of the year to revisit some of the tax deductions and benefits available to real estate owners and real estate agents. Even with all the negative issues (e.g., inflation, increasing interest rates, higher energy and food prices, and much more) affecting the overall economy in 2021, the real estate industry had yet another record-breaking year. It is important for real estate professionals to be aware of some of the tax breaks available so that they may inform their clients about them and take advantage of them as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Deductions Available to Sellers</strong></p>
<p><em>Selling Costs and Improvements Made Within 90 Days of A Closing</em></p>
<p>Sellers are permitted to deduct certain expenses incurred in connection with the sale of their residence [see <em>Realtor.com</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3Jaoxgo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3Jaoxgo</a>]. Some of these expenses include legal fees, title fees, mortgage payoff fees, real estate commissions, advertising costs and staging fees incurred to prepare the home for sale. These deductions are permitted provided they are incurred directly as a result of selling the home. According to <em>Realtor.com</em> in order to take advantage of these deductions, a homeowner must have “lived in the home for at least two of the five years preceding the sale. Another caveat: The home must be a principal residence and not an investment property.” These costs are deducted from the gross proceeds received at closing thereby reducing the gain realized on the sale. In turn, this will ultimately affect the amount of capital gains tax paid, if any, by the seller.</p>
<p>Sellers may also deduct costs incurred within 90 days of a closing in connection with renovating and preparing the home for sale. Normally, home improvements do not include ordinary repair and maintenance items that are considered “normal wear and tear,” and therefore, would not be deductible. However, if a homeowner paints, replaces a water heater, makes repairs to the roof, or undertakes other similar repairs in order to prepare for the sale of the home, those costs may be deducted.</p>
<p><em>Capital Gains Tax</em></p>
<p>Sellers may also be required to pay taxes on the profit realized from the sale of their real estate. The tax is known as a capital gains tax. There are two types of capital gains taxes: (1) short-term capital gains; and (2) long-term capital gains. If a seller holds a property (or capital asset) for less than a year, then the seller would pay ordinary income taxes on any gain realized. If, however, a seller holds a property for more than one year, then the seller will benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. <em>Realtor.com</em> provides a simple breakdown of the various capital gains tax rates and brackets:</p>
<p>• Your tax rate is 0% on long-term capital gains if you’re a single filer earning less than $40,400, married filing jointly earning less than $80,800, or head of household earning less than $54,100.</p>
<p>• Your tax rate is 15% on long-term capital gains if you’re a single filer earning between $40,401 and $445,850, married filing jointly earning between $80,801 and $501,600, or head of household earning between $54,101 and $473,750.</p>
<p>• Your tax rate is 20% on long-term capital gains if you’re a single filer earning more than $445,851, married filing jointly earning more than $501,601, or head of household earning more than $473,751. For those earning above $501,601, the rate tops out at 20%.</p>
<p><em>Personal Residence Capital Gains Exclusion</em></p>
<p>One important and substantial benefit that is available to owners who sell their primary residence (which may be a single-family home, condominium, cooperative apartment, a mobile home, or a houseboat) is the ability to exclude up to $250,000 for a single person, and up to $500,000 for a married couple filing jointly, from capital gains, provided certain conditions required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are met [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3I3Ux4m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3I3Ux4m</a>].</p>
<p>According to the IRS, sellers may only qualify for the exclusion in connection with the “the sale of a home that is [their] principal [i.e., main] residence….” An individual can only have one principal residence at a time. If an individual or individuals own more than one home, then the IRS requires that a “facts and circumstances” test be applied to determine which property is the principal residence. The IRS points out that the time spent in the home is the most important factor.</p>
<p>However, according to the IRS, there are other factors that could be considered as well: (1) “the address listed on your: U.S. Postal Service address, Voter Registration Card, federal and state tax returns, and driver&#8217;s license or car registration”; and (2) “[t]he home is near: where you work, where you bank, the residence of one or more family members, and recreational clubs or religious organizations of which you are a member.” This element has become more critical recently because many individuals have purchased new homes out of state and have kept their existing homes due the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to maintain the principal residence status in order to be able to take advantage of the exclusion.</p>
<p>Once the “main” residence test is satisfied, the following conditions must also be met: (1) the seller must have owned the home for at least two years out of the last five years leading up to the date of closing, (2) the seller must have owned the home and used it as the seller’s principal residence for at least two years of the previous five years; and (3) the seller had not sold another principal residence within the last 24 months prior to the date of closing (or, if the seller did sell another home, the seller did not take the exclusion). According to the IRS, the “24 months of residence can fall anywhere within the five-year period, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be a single block of time.” A seller may be able to take a partial exclusion, provided certain exceptions are satisfied, in the event the seller was forced to move due to a job-related reason.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Step-Up in Basis:&#8221;  Capital Gains on Inherited Homes Being Sold</em></p>
<p>Another important tax concept for real estate professionals and for individuals who are selling homes that they just inherited is the concept of “stepped-up basis.” When a person passes away and leaves a home (or any real or personal property) to heirs, the heirs do not inherit the cost basis of the decedent. Rather, the heirs receive the property with a “stepped-up” cost basis which is the date of death value of the property rather than the original cost basis of the property at the time the decedent first purchased the property.</p>
<p>For example, if the decedent purchased the home at a cost of $150,000 back in 1990, and the home is worth $1.15 million at the time of decedent’s death, the cost basis would now be $1.15 million, also referred to as the “date of death” value. Therefore, any gain would be calculated starting from the $1.15 million amount rather than the original cost basis amount of $150,000. It is important that an appraisal be obtained so that the new basis, date of death value, can be established. If the property is not sold right away or if it is held for many years, it is important to have the appraisal prepared for IRS purposes so that the value is established as of the date of death and the correct capital gains tax can be determined at the time the property is eventually sold.</p>
<p><em>Capital Gains Tax on Multi-Family Property Utilized Also As Primary Residence</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that individuals who utilize a portion of a multi-family property as their primary residence may lose some of the primary residence exclusions. That portion of the property that is used as a rental/investment property will not benefit from the personal residence capital gains exclusion. Only the percentage that is being used as the primary residence will benefit from the exclusion. For example, if the property is a two-family property and a married couple uses one of the apartments as their principal residence (i.e., 50% of the premises), and they sell the property for $1 million, the $500,000 exclusion would only apply to 50% of the sale price, the other 50% would be subject to a capital gains tax calculated on the amount above 50% of the original cost basis. Many are not aware of this, and it is important that sellers discuss this with their accountant so that they are aware of the tax consequences before they place the property on the market.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Deductions and Tax Avoidance Tools For Real Estate Owners</strong></p>
<p><em>Principal Mortgage and HELOC Interest Deductions</em></p>
<p>Another benefit of home ownership is that homeowners are permitted to deduct mortgage interest on their tax returns. However, it important to note that there are some limitations on how much interest may be deducted depending on the type of loan and the amount of the loan. There are two type of loans that homeowners usually take out on their homes: (1) a principal mortgage (usually obtained in connection with the initial purchase of the home, also known as “home acquisition debt”), and (2) a home equity loan or home equity line of credit.</p>
<p>Under the 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, changes were made to the amount of interest that could be deducted on a principal mortgage or “home acquisition debt.” For new loans obtained on or after Dec. 15, 2017, a homeowner is only allowed to deduct interest incurred on debt of up to $750,000. For those homeowners who took out a mortgage prior to Dec. 15, 2017, the higher amount of $1 million, which was the limit previously in effect, still applies.</p>
<p>The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changed the rules regarding the home equity loan and home equity line of credit (HELOC). Under the previous tax rules, a homeowner may deduct the interest on up to $100,000 of home equity debt, as long as the total mortgage debt was below $1 million. Now, a homeowner may only deduct interest incurred on a home equity loan or HELOC if the loan proceeds were used specifically for home improvement or renovations purposes. If the proceeds were used to pay off credit card debt, go on vacation, pay for college, or any other non-home improvement reason, then deducting the interest is not permitted. However, if the loan proceeds were used to purchase, build or renovate the home, the new $750,000 limit would apply, and interest incurred on the $750,000 amount would be deductible.</p>
<p><em>Real Property Taxes Up to $10,000 and Private Mortgage Insurance Deductible</em></p>
<p>The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also reduced the amount of real estate taxes that could be deducted to $10,000. While this has been the subject of much controversy over the past several years, it is important to note that the deduction is still available, although capped at the above amount.</p>
<p>Many homeowners and real estate professionals are also not aware that private mortgage insurance premiums are deductible. Over the past few years, purchasers have been taking out loans (e.g., FHA Loans, etc.) that exceed the 80% loan-to-value ratio threshold requiring the borrower-purchaser to pay private mortgage insurance [see <em>Realtor.com</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3hYGQZR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3hYGQZR</a>]. According to <em>Realtor.com</em>, the owner should expect the “PMI payment to range from about 0.3% to 1.15% of your home loan. The most common way to pay PMI loan premiums to your lender is in monthly installments, but you may also be able to make your PMI payments in an upfront cost at your home closing, or roll it into the cost of the loan.” The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 originally provided for the deductibility of PMI. The Mortgage Insurance Tax Deduction Act of 2021 then reinstated certain deductions and credits for homeowners that expired in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>A Basic Knowledge of Taxes and Tax Consequences Is Important</strong></p>
<p>The issues highlighted herein are just a small segment of the vast tax benefits and tax consequences that exist. It is important for real estate owners and investors to seek the advice of their accountants and tax professionals before they dive into buying, selling and investing in real estate. It is also important for real estate professionals, such as real estate agents, real estate attorneys, property managers and developers to be informed about the various tax benefits and ramifications that are involved in real estate transactions so that guidance may be provided to their clients interested in purchasing or selling real estate.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The March 10th rally staged in a parking lot at the Galleria at Crystal Run in the Town of Wallkill was held by the 17-Forward-86 Coalition, which is advocating for an additional lane in both directors as well as interchange upgrades from Southern Orange County to Monticello.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>TOWN OF WALLKILL—Near a busy overpass for Route 17, state and local government leaders joined business and building trades representatives to press New York State to move forward with necessary environmental studies that will lead to what they say is the long-overdue expansion of Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties.</p>
<p>The March 10th rally staged in a parking lot at the Galleria at Crystal Run in the Town of Wallkill was held by the 17-Forward-86 Coalition, which is advocating for an additional lane in both directions as well as interchange upgrades from Southern Orange County to Monticello.</p>
<p>The final report from the New York State Department of Transportation’s Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group released in November 2021 recommended the state move forward with a General Use Third Lane in each direction on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties that could if built as one major project cost anywhere from $650 million to $1.27 billion to complete.</p>
<p>The PEL Study Group is also recommending that interchange upgrades be undertaken at exits in Orange and Sullivan counties and that improvements be made in the region to improve connectivity to existing transit.</p>
<p>Maureen Halahan, president of the Orange County Partnership and 17-Forward-86 co-chair, noted that Gov. Kathy Hochul identified the Route 17 expansion as a priority for her administration in her State of the State message earlier this year. She said the rally’s goal was to press New York State leadership to allocate the funding necessary to construct an additional lane on Route 17 and make other much-needed upgrades to the corridor as part of the new five-year New York State Department of Transportation capital plan.</p>
<p>“This long-overdue project is in all of our best interests. It’s about safety, sustainability, protecting our environment and preparing for our future. Widening and upgrading the Route 17 corridor will make our roads safer and provide better access for first responders,” Halahan said. “It will ease conditions for all motorists, reducing harmful emissions from idling vehicles. This project will create good-paying jobs, which will help restore a sense of stability in our communities and give local economies a much-needed boost.”</p>
<p>John Cooney, executive director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc., and a member of the 17-Forward-86 Coalition, also noted the pressing need for Route 17 upgrades and urged members of the New York State Assembly, the New York State Senate and Gov. Hochul to include funding for the project in the five-year New York State Department of Transportation capital plan.</p>
<p>He added that the governor’s overall proposed NYSDOT Five-Year Capital Plan needs to be increased by $10 billion from $32.8 billion to $42.8 billion so that signature projects like Route 17-I-86 can begin while also increasing the investment that will go a long way to improving the existing conditions of all the roads and bridges in New York State.</p>
<p>“New York State has never, in its history, had a better opportunity to increase the amount of money to spend on its roads and bridges and specifically on Route 17,” Cooney said. “The federal government has given New York State a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to leverage its dollars and truly make improvements in our infrastructure. Let’s seize it.”</p>
<p>In a clear act of bipartisan support for the project, Democratic State Senator James Skoufis and Republican Senator Mike Martucci stood side by side expressing the urgent need for the Route 17 project to proceed.</p>
<p>Sen. Skoufis noted that the campaign for upgrades to Route 17 and its conversion to federal Interstate-86 has been a long one, noting the I-86 signs on the roadway have begun to rust.</p>
<p>“The good news is we are almost at the finish line here,” he said. “Because of the work we have all done, I can tell you, as a matter of fact, and the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation who I spoke with two weeks ago will tell you, that this project getting done is no longer a matter of if, it is just a matter of when.”</p>
<p>Sen. Martucci, said this long-stalled project should proceed now there is federal money available. “Our time is now. The groundwork has been laid and the men and women of labor who stand behind us today are ready to get this done with us,” he said. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to finally address an issue that impacts our quality of life, our economic development and really everything here in the Hudson Valley. Let&#8217;s get this done.”</p>
<p>At the rally, a host of other business, political and organized labor leaders also called for the state to complete the studies and fund the expansion project for Route 17. Among the speakers included: Sharon Soons, Executive Director of Vision Hudson Valley; David Yannetta of Local 825, International Union of Operating Engineers; Orange County Undersheriff Ken Jones; Orange County Deputy Executive Harold Porr; Town of Thompson Supervisor William J. Rieber, Jr. and Town of Wallkill Supervisor George Serrano.</p>
<p>If the state moves forward with the expansion project, the scope of the construction of the General Use Third Lane beginning at Exit 131 in Harriman (Orange County) to Exit 103 (Rapp Road) in Monticello in Sullivan County would determine the cost of the project. Option 1, which involves using the basic existing footprint of the roadway and shoulders to accommodate a third lane in each direction would cost $385 million to $470 million for the Orange County stretch of roadway and another $265 million to $325 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>Under Option 2, which would involve widening the existing roadway to accommodate the third lane expansions in both directions so that most of Route 17 would conform to federal Interstate standards, the costs would escalate. For the Orange County stretch, the cost would run between $615 million to $750 million, while the Sullivan County component’s cost ranges from $425 million to $520 million.</p>
<p>Not included in those project numbers are potential interchange upgrades in Orange County, which could run from $135 million to $175 million and in Sullivan County from $43 million to $144 million.</p>
<p>Recommended improvements to Connectivity to Existing Transit projects are projected to cost between $1 million to $1.5 million in Sullivan County and $9 million to $10 million in Orange County.</p>
<p>At the rally, 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair Marc Baez, President and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership, urged the state to act now and make the long-overdue upgrades to Route 17.</p>
<p>“There are thousands of stakeholders committed to seeing this project through,” Baez said. “We’re at the 30-yard line. This budget must get us into the end zone or we’ll be stuck on the 30-yard line for at least another five years. That extra $5 billion in federal funding earmarked for New York State positions us to move forward—now. Let’s run with it.”</p>
<p>The 17-Forward 86 Coalition was established in August 2018 by a group of advocates who support the widening of Route 17 and now comprises more than 200 members of economic development groups, construction trades, environmental stewardship, tourism groups, business, health care and energy companies.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales dipped in February, continuing a seesawing pattern of gains and declines over the last few months, according to the National Association of Realtors. Each of the four major U.S. regions saw sales fall on a month-over-month basis in February.</p>
<p>Sales activity year-over-year was also down overall, though the South experienced an increase while the remaining three regions reported drops in transactions. Existing-home sales in the Northeast slipped 11.5% in February, registering an annual rate of 690,000, a 12.7% drop from February 2021. The median price in the Northeast was $383,700, up 7.1% from one year ago.</p>
<p>Total existing-home sales, which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, sank 7.2% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.02 million in February. Year-over-year, sales decreased 2.4% (6.17 million in February 2021).</p>
<p>“Housing affordability continues to be a major challenge, as buyers are getting a double whammy: rising mortgage rates and sustained price increases,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR&#8217;s chief economist. “Some who had previously qualified at a 3% mortgage rate are no longer able to buy at the 4% rate.”</p>
<p>He added, “Monthly payments have risen by 28% from one year ago—which interestingly is not a part of the consumer price index—and the market remains swift with multiple offers still being recorded on most properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Total housing inventory at the end of February totaled 870,000 units, up 2.4% from January and down 15.5% from one year ago (1.03 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 1.7-month supply at the current sales pace, up from the record-low supply in January of 1.6 months and down from 2.0 months in February 2021.</p>
<p>Yun noted that rising rates and escalating prices have prevented many consumers from making a purchase.</p>
<p>“The sharp jump in mortgage rates and increasing inflation is taking a heavy toll on consumers&#8217; savings,” he said. “However, I expect the pace of price appreciation to slow as demand cools and as supply improves somewhat due to more home construction.”</p>
<p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in February was $357,300, up 15.0% from February 2021 ($310,600), as prices grew in each region. This marks 120 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.</p>
<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 18 days in February, down from 19 days in January and 20 days in February 2021. Eighty-four percent of homes sold in February 2022 were on the market for less than a month.</p>
<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in February, up from 27% in January and down from 31% in February 2021. NAR&#8217;s 2021 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in late 2021—reported that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.</p>
<p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 19% of homes in February, down from 22% in January but up from 17% in February 2021. All-cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions in February, down from 27% in January and up from 22% in February 2021.</p>
<p>Distressed sales— foreclosures and short sales—represented less than 1% of sales in February, equal to the percentage seen in both January 2022 and February 2021.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.76% in February, up from 3.45% in January. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.</p>
<p>Realtor.com’s Market Trends Report in February showed that the greatest year-over-year median list price growth occurred in Las Vegas (+39.6%), Miami (+31.6%) and Tampa (+31.5%). Austin posted the highest growth in the share of homes which had their prices reduced compared to last year (+3.3 percentage points), followed by Milwaukee (+2.1 percentage points), Pittsburgh and Baltimore (+1.4 percentage points each).</p>
<p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p>
<p>Single-family home sales jumped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million in February, down 7.0% from 5.75 million in January and down 2.2% from one year ago. The median existing single-family home price was $363,800 in February, up 15.5% from February 2021.</p>
<p>Existing condominium and co-op sales were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units in February, down 9.5% from 740,000 in January and down 4.3% from one year ago. The median existing condo price was $305,400 in February, an annual increase of 10.9%.</p>
<p>“For the past couple of years, buyers have had to contend with a market of high demand, low inventory and a mix of uncertainties with COVID-19 protocols,” said NAR President Leslie Rouda Smith, a Realtor from Plano, TX, and a broker associate at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate in Dallas. “Consumers are presently challenged with higher mortgage rates, so now, more than ever, interested buyers need the trusted expertise of Realtors in order to navigate this current market.”</p>
<p><strong>Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the Midwest sagged 11.3% from the prior month to an annual rate of 1,330,000 in February, a 1.5% decrease from February 2021. The median price in the Midwest was $248,900, a 7.5% climb from February 2021.</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the South fell 5.1% in February from the prior month, posting an annual rate of 2,790,000, an increase of 3.0% from one year ago. The median price in the South was $318,800, an 18.1% jump from one year prior. For the sixth straight month, the South experienced the highest pace of price appreciation compared to the other regions.</p>
<p>“Employment is vital for housing demand,” said Yun. “The Southern states are seeing faster job growth, and consequently, it&#8217;s the only region to experience a sales gain from a year ago.”</p>
<p>Existing-home sales in the West slid 4.7% from the previous month, reporting an annual rate of 1,210,000 in February, down 8.3% from one year ago. The median price in the West was $512,600, up 7.1% from February 2021.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Amy Chorew, a Connecticut Realtor and President of Curated Learning, first heard about cryptocurrency back in 2017 while having her hair styled. “My hairdresser was talking about buying a condo and cashing out $50,000 in cryptocurrency as part of the down payment. All I could say at that time was ‘what’s that?’” she admitted.</p>
<p>Fast forward five years and now cryptocurrency is slowly inching into real estate transactions, with some potential homebuyers using virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase the home of their dreams or even commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Chorew recently presented “Cryptocurrency, the Future of Real Estate” at one of HGAR’s first live events for the Empire Chapter of the Women’s Council of Realtors. The March 15th presentation drew almost 100 Realtors to HGAR’s White Plains headquarters.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is described by Wikipedia as a digital type of currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network and secured by encryption methods.</p>
<p>A cryptocurrency is a tradable digital asset or digital form of money, built on blockchain technology, that exists only online. There are currently more than a thousand different cryptocurrencies in the world, and Bitcoin, first released in 2009, is one of the most popular.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form like paper money or coins, is unregulated and currently not issued by a central authority like a bank. However, President Biden’s recently signed executive order is calling on government agencies to study cryptocurrencies and develop a government-wide approach to regulating digital assets to protect consumers.</p>
<p>So how do you purchase cryptocurrency? Chorew explains that getting started requires a credit card or direct deposit purchase to set up your “crypto wallet” that will hold all your digital currency. “The amount of crypto can fluctuate like the stock market, but there are also stable crypto coins that are redeemable on a one-to-one basis for the U.S. dollar,” she said.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is the most well-known, Chorew notes that many real estate transactions are done with Ethereum, another digital currency.</p>
<p>Chorew compares the cryptocurrency craze with people’s initial reactions to social media almost 20 years ago. “I remember it was 2004 and I was almost laughed out of the room at a conference when I started talking about the impact of social media on real estate transactions,” Chorew revealed. “It was just like predicting how the Internet would replace the old real estate listing books. The important thing is that even with the use cryptocurrency now, the real estate agent is still a vital part of the transaction.”</p>
<p>So, what’s the advantage of using cryptocurrency for real estate transactions? According to Chorew, there’s a lot less fraud because of the stability of the blockchain technology—a system of recording data that makes it almost impossible to change or hack. “It’s also easier to do business using cryptocurrency and blockchains,” explained Chorew. “Because everything is decentralized, the individual serves as the bank. For global transactions, it’s borderless, making international real estate deals faster and safe.”</p>
<div id="attachment_40221" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40221" class="wp-image-40221" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WCR-Event.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="260" /><p id="caption-attachment-40221" class="wp-caption-text">The Women’s Council of Realtors’ presentation on Cryptocurrency and Real Estate drew almost 100 Realtors to HGAR in White Plains.</p></div>
<p>While cryptocurrency may fluctuate, Chorew notes, it doesn’t affect the value of a property. The most common way to buy a home with cryptocurrency is to convert it into U.S. dollars at an agreed exchange rate, or in some cases, home sellers will accept the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>David Conroy, Director of Emerging Technology for the National Association of Realtors, has been involved with this emerging technology since 2013. “In most cases, a real estate deal involving cryptocurrency will use a third party, such as BitPay, where the buyer can exchange the crypto for cash,” he explained. “Buyers can then use that as a down payment, or as an entire cash payment. In some cases, the home seller may even accept a cryptocurrency payment in lieu of cash.”</p>
<p>In addition to purchases, accepting rent, escrow, or down payments in cryptocurrency could reduce settlement time to seconds instead of days, eliminate the needs for wires, while only costing pennies in transaction fees even with international buyers, Conroy added.</p>
<p>The blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency exists can also serve as the single source of truth for a property or a transaction. “Imagine a verifiable record of a property’s past ownership. This could enable the parties to a deal, who generally don&#8217;t know each other, to trust that the seller has true ownership of that property and see without any question that there are not any claims against it,” he explained.</p>
<p>Conroy noted that most of the domestic crypto transactions are currently concentrated among very high-end residential properties in California’s Silicon Valley and Miami. “Right now, we’re not seeing this used in a lot of commercial real estate purchases, but that of course could change in the future,” he added.</p>
<p>In the meantime, NAR is preparing to launch a Presidential Advisory Group to research the impact of cryptocurrency on the real estate industry. “Despite the number of opportunities, it will likely still be years before we see blockchain enter the organized real estate industry here in the U.S.,” Conroy surmised. “The technology is still gaining maturity.”</p>
<p>Chorew agrees but remains optimistic about its future use in real estate. “We’re still in the wild west with cryptocurrency right now,” she acknowledged. “However, trends do tend to become standards, and I believe in the very near future we’ll begin to see cryptocurrencies in real estate transactions becoming part of the norm, instead of something new.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The share of millennial home buyers increased significantly over the past year. They are also the most likely generation to use the Internet to find the home they ultimately purchase and most likely to use a real estate agent, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors on March 23.</p>
<p>The 2022 Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends report, which examines the similarities and differences of recent home buyers and sellers across generations, found that the combined share of younger millennial (23 to 31 years old) and older millennial buyers (32 to 41 years old) rose to 43% in 2021, up from 37% the year prior. Almost two out of three younger millennials—65%—found the home they ultimately purchased on the Internet, a number that gradually decreases with older generations. Eighty-seven percent of all buyers purchased their home through an agent. This number was highest with younger millennials (92%) and older millennials (88%).</p>
<p>“Some young adults have used the pandemic to their financial advantage by paying down debt and cutting the cost of rent by moving in with family. They are now jumping headfirst into homeownership,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR&#8217;s vice president of demographics and behavioral insights. “While young buyers use new tech tools, they also use real estate agents at higher rates than other buyers to help find the right home and negotiate the terms of the transaction.”</p>
<p>Buyers from all generations agreed about the top reasons for using an agent: they wanted help finding the right home to purchase, negotiating the terms of sale and negotiating the price. The silent generation—those between the ages of 76 and 96—as well as younger millennials were also more likely to want their agent to help with paperwork.</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 42 and 56—Generation X—had the highest median household income at $125,000. They bought the most expensive and second-largest homes at a median price of $320,000 and size of 2,300 square feet, respectively. Older millennials purchased the largest homes at 2,400 square feet, and the silent generation bought the smallest at 1,800 square feet. Across all generations, the largest share of buyers purchased in suburban areas (51%) and small towns (20%).</p>
<p>“Not surprisingly, younger generations typically upgraded in size and price while older generations purchased more affordable properties,” Lautz said. “The majority of all generations bought single-family homes at higher shares than other housing types, and younger buyers dispelled the myth that they are flocking to city centers. When it comes to location, the suburbs and small towns are the places to buy.”</p>
<p>Three out of five of recent buyers—60%—were married couples, 19% were single females, 9% were single males and 9% were unmarried couples. The highest share of unmarried couples were younger millennials at 21%. Single-female buyers significantly outnumbered single-male buyers across all generations. The highest percentage of single-female buyers was in the silent generation at 27%.</p>
<p>The study also found that first-time home buying among younger generations is on the rise, with over four out of five younger millennial home buyers—81%—purchasing for the first time. Just under half—48%—of older millennial buyers were first-time buyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the pandemic allowed many potential buyers to save for a down payment, demographics played a key role,&#8221; Lautz said. &#8220;There is a wave of millennial buyers who are aging into the traditional first-time buyer age range.&#8221; Boomers made up the largest share of home sellers at 42%, although the percentage of millennial sellers is on the rise, increasing from 22% to 26% over the past year. Lautz noted that for the first time it is now more likely for an older millennial to be a first-time seller than a first-time buyer.</p>
<p>“Many factors can contribute to the decision to buy or sell a home,” Lautz continued. “For all home buyers under the age of 57, the main driver was the desire to own a home of their own. Among those 57 and older, the desire to be closer to friends and family was the top reason, followed by the desire for a smaller home.”</p>
<p>Younger generations tended to move shorter distances when relocating. Among all ages, there was a median of 15 miles from the homes where recent buyers previously resided and the homes that they purchased. That distance was lowest among younger millennials (10 miles) and highest among older boomers (35 miles).</p>
<p>Overall, buyers expected to live in their homes for 12 years, down from 15 years last year. For younger millennials and the silent generation, the expected duration was only 10 years, compared to 20 years for younger boomers.</p>
<p>Debt continues to be a significant barrier for many when attempting to buy a home. Both Generation X and younger boomers delayed purchasing a home for five years due to debt, the longest of all age groups. Younger millennials had the highest share of student debt at 45%, with a median amount of $28,000. Twenty-seven percent of younger millennials cited that saving for a down payment was the most challenging step in the home buying process, compared to just 1% for older boomers. Nearly one in three—29%—of younger millennials received down payment help in the form of a gift or loan from a friend or relative and 24% lived with friends or family, directly saving on rental costs.</p>
<p>Despite this hurdle, a vast majority of buyers have a positive outlook on homeownership. Eighty-six percent of all buyers reported they viewed a home purchase as a good investment, and roughly nine out of 10 people—89%—said that they would recommend their agent for future services.</p>
<p>“A truth across all generations is that homeownership is seen as a cornerstone of the American dream,” said NAR President Leslie Rouda Smith, a Realtor from Plano, TX, and a broker associate at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate in Dallas. “From building personal wealth and fostering communities, to strengthening social stability and driving the national economy, the value of homeownership is indisputable. Home buyers continue to turn to Realtors as a trusted resource for helping find the right home and successfully navigating this increasingly complex process.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Earlier this month Real Estate In-Depth chatted with Bosch on his goals for the organization, some of the key issues facing the Hudson Valley and some possible solutions to some of the pressing problems that now exist in the region.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Recently, a new leader took the helm of what some in the business community consider the Hudson Valley’s very own think tank—Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress. The Board of Directors at Pattern for Progress appointed Adam Bosch, 39. to be the organization’s next president and chief executive officer, replacing Jonathan Drapkin, who had led the organization for 15 years.</p>
<p>Bosch, a lifelong resident of the Hudson Valley, previously worked as a journalist, college professor, and policy analyst across the region before joining the senior leadership team of the New York City water supply system. He is Pattern’s sixth president since the organization was founded in 1965.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> chatted with Bosch on his goals for the organization, some of the key issues facing the Hudson Valley and some possible solutions to some of the pressing problems that now exist in the region.</p>
<p>Bosch started his career as a journalist in the Hudson Valley. He covered public affairs, courts and the environment for the <em>Wallkill Valley Times</em>, the <em>Middletown Times Herald-Record</em>, and in the Albany bureau of <em>The New York Times</em>. His work also appeared in several regional and national magazines. His work in journalism earned six Associated Press awards for investigative reporting, depth reporting, and breaking news coverage. Bosch also served as an adjunct professor of journalism for 10 years at SUNY New Paltz.</p>
<p>After leaving journalism, Bosch joined Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress in 2012 as vice president of research and external affairs. Bosch authored reports on the adaptive re-use of closed school buildings across the region, New York’s tax cap, and an investigation of Rockland County’s budget deficit. His examination of Rockland County’s fiscal crisis, and recommendations to solve it, earned Pattern the President’s Award from the Rockland County Business Association.</p>
<p>For the past nine years, Bosch has served as director of public affairs for the New York City water supply system—the largest municipal water supply in the United States. In that role, Bosch was responsible for community outreach, intergovernmental affairs, education programs and more. He served as the primary liaison between New York City and federal, state and local officials across the Hudson Valley and Catskills for issues related to the city’s reservoir system and its infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> You have recently taken over as the Pattern for Progress President and CEO, succeeding the highly respected Jonathan Drapkin, who led the organization for more than 15 years. What are some of your goals for Pattern going forward?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-40296" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pattern-for-Progress-.png" alt="" width="350" height="350" />Bosch:</strong> It’s really important for Pattern to continue to identify the issues that matter most across the region… One of the things that I am doing early on is having chats with people. When you have chats with people you start to hear the same thing three times, five times, eight times and that is a really good way to understand, especially when you hear those things in places that are far apart geographically, so if I hear the same thing in Westchester that I am hearing in Sullivan and Greene, this is a challenge for the whole region and not just one town or one city. So, early on what I am trying to do is identify the challenges that all our cities, towns and counties have in common and then really try to identify the ones where Pattern can bring some research and recommendations that can be put into action in a way that is helpful. That is the piece that is most important to me. The work of Pattern for Progress cannot be purely academic. It needs to be practical; it needs to be useful and it needs to be timely.</p>
<p>My goal is to do the research—we are known for thorough and deep, objective research. But, there is a second step to that and that second step is to bring that information to the people who have the passion and the authority to act on it and also to bring it to them in a form of advocacy that encourages them to act on it and shows why it is in the best interest of them and the people that they represent or employ. So, when we bring it to our leaders, we have to bring it with both instructive communication because we are supposed to be teaching the region about things, but we also have to bring it to the region with persuasive communication because ultimately, we want to convince them to take some action we think is in the best interest of our communities. So, that is really one of my chief goals is to understand now we can turn our good work into action on the ground in a way that improves the lives of our neighbors. …</p>
<p>So, what’s the number one issue as I go across the region?  You might say housing, yes, I am hearing a lot about housing. I am hearing a lot about people not being able to find the workers they need because there is this mis-alignment between the workers we need and the workers we have. However, actually the number one word in literally every single meeting I’ve had in the first almost two months at this point, is daycare. I have not had a single meeting where the word daycare has not come up. That comes up in the context of housing, it comes up in the context of workforce, it comes up in the context of businesses and benefits and struggles as to how we keep people here.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Bosch said that Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress will be working on this issue and research best practices that are working elsewhere in the nation and perhaps have some area of the Hudson Valley employ those measures to address the daycare problem.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> I understand Pattern is about to release a major study on the state of infrastructure in the Hudson Valley. Can you give us a preview of some of its key findings?</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-40294" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_0896.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" />Bosch:</strong> I will mention a couple of its findings. We are going to do a big rollout of this study that we did for the Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; the Hudson Valley in the coming weeks. A couple of findings off the top of my head. If you look at the rate of investment in our infrastructure and by infrastructure I am specifically talking about roads, bridges, water and sewer, which the study was limited to, over the past decade the rate of investment has been flat when you adjust it for inflation. There have been some modest upticks, but the upticks don’t catch up to inflation. So, essentially the rate of investment has been flat. During the pandemic there was a little tapping of the brakes where some of the government agencies that help subsidize infrastructure projects sort of held onto their money as it wasn’t clear what the pandemic was going to do to government finances and so the disbursement of that money slowed down for a year. …</p>
<p>The rate of investment we see in infrastructure now is not even close to what we need to play catch up to the things that are past their useful life and their expected life cycle. Much of our infrastructure is past its expected life cycle. … There are some movements afoot, obviously the federal infrastructure bill should provide a shot in the arm in terms of some more money coming in for these things. I know the state has some bond issues that are going to come up for vote and other things where they are trying to inject more money into infrastructure to help play catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Pattern for Progress CEO Bosch noted that there are 3,153 bridges in the Hudson Valley, of which 1,531 fall under local jurisdiction. A total of 17% of the locally maintained bridges are deemed in poor condition. It is estimated it will cost $493 million to fix the local bridges in the Hudson Valley that are rated in poor condition. That figure does not factor in the recent spike in inflation or the repairs needed for state-maintained spans.</p>
<p>I know the counties are getting this infrastructure money and they are starting to think about what to do with it. Addressing some of these poorly rated bridges is one place they could begin and allocate some of that money.</p>
<p>Another finding is on the jobs front. We hear anecdotally and through data that finding employees is becoming really hard for DPWs (Department of Public Works) and water and sewer utilities. You have all these workers from the baby-boomer generation that are beginning to retire. The younger cohorts coming up are smaller in number, so their recruitment field is smaller, they tend to be less interested in this type of work in general, and it is difficult to recruit. We are having difficulty in the engineering sector. We are having difficulty in finding certified water and wastewater operators… So, what you have is utilities stealing them (these workers) from each other… So, we are just shuffling the chairs around on the deck. We are not actually producing more of these employees. That leads to people to think should we utilize outside contractors to operate the plants and that comes with upside and downside (issues). … So, a big challenge when it comes to infrastructure is just where is the next generation of stewards of our infrastructure going to come from? …</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Pattern’s Center for Housing Solutions &amp; Community Initiatives has held highly informative webinars and issued Regional Housing Market Reports on the state of the residential real estate sector in the Hudson Valley. With prices rising and inventory at record lows, what is Pattern suggesting can be done to make housing accessible to the region’s workforce?</p>
<p><strong>Bosch:</strong> What we are seeing with housing right now is pretty wild. Over the past four to five years, we have seen the cost of single-family homes in some parts of the region double. The median single-family home price in the region over the past year has gone up by $50,000. What that is doing, especially for young families, it is making homeownership unattainable and because homeownership is unattainable, it is pushing more people into the rental market. And, when more people get pushed into the rental market, rents go up. So, now you have this cascading situation where housing prices go up, people are flooding the rental market, rental prices go up and for people who are at the bottom of the rental market, it makes it very hard for them to find an honorable place to live at a reasonable price. This results in more people paying a higher portion of their salary toward housing costs and that we know is bad for the economy because when you can only spend your money on things you absolutely need, you don’t have any money left to spend on things you want, like goods, dinner and other things that help the economy go round.</p>
<p>So, we are seeing that trend. While there are some signs the rates of increase are slowing or maybe even leveling off, that is what we are going to be watching this year. There has been this influx of people coming into the region as a result of the pandemic, escaping more urban areas and driving the price of these homes up and driving the rental market (and prices) up. We think we are likely to see the plateauing of that this year and then whether it comes down a little bit and back to reality or not is sort of an open question. But, it really has an effect on our workforce and the ability of our workforce to find a place to live that does not gobble up a significant portion of their income.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40297 alignleft" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rc-crisis-adam-bosch.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="360" />Inventory on the market is down by thousands and thousands of units. It is down by half as compared to what it normally is. So, when we look towards solutions, there is no silver bullet here, but there are a bunch of things we need to think about doing to help this problem. …</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Bosch said that some potential solutions would be to increase the number of affordable housing units targeted for the region’s workforce, assistance for first-time buyers for their down payments, as well as possibly allowing accessory living units.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What do you see are the key issues facing the Hudson Valley in the years ahead and how can Pattern for Progress highlight those needs and their potential solutions?</p>
<p>So, we talked about housing at length. The way we are going to highlight (the issues) is we are going to get out in front of the people that don’t know these issues and hear about them. I don’t have to tell you that local government officials change every few years. There is a very quick turnover rate in terms of our town, village and city boards. They actually have some tools at their disposal that can help with things like housing. So, we need to get the message about housing and the tools at their disposal out in front of them in a way that mixes education and advocacy. I talked to you about childcare already. The other thing that we are going to be doing over the course of the next year is we started this new program called “Main Street Hudson Valley.” New York State is one of the only states in the country that does not have a dedicated government office for issues related to Main Street revitalization. We are creating one for the Hudson Valley and it is going to start with some programs that begin this month. There will be a program each month that will be related to some topic that is important for Main Street revitalization. And again, you are going to hear this again from me, but you will begin to understand it is very important to me—it is not going to be academic; it is going to (feature) highly practical things.</p>
<p>The first program that we are going to do in March is called “People First—Main Street.” During the pandemic we saw a a lot of creativity on Main Streets. There were pedestrian plazas that popped up, street festivals, the utilization of sidewalks and streets differently for businesses. Main Streets really got creative in terms of how they drew people to the downtown areas. Essentially, how to put people on the street. … So, what we are doing is we will have a bunch of products that are going to come out of this resource center. One of them is called “Main Street Bulletins” and one of them is called “Sidewalk Talks.” The “Main Street Bulletins” are going to be small research papers that dive deep into the topic that we set aside each month and actually bring practical examples of ways that communities have, in one case, created a people magnet on their Main Street. We are going to walk people through how it was conceived, planned, funded and implemented so that you could actually see yourself doing a project like this in your community or giving it a try. “Sidewalk Talks” will feature guest speakers who are going to come and do webinars for the region’s government officials and businesses that are dealing with Main Streets. …</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> While you worked at Pattern as vice president of research and external affairs, you have extensive experience in communications, first as a journalist, including stints at the Middletown Times-Herald Record and New York Times, and later with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection as its director of public affairs. How do you believe your background will serve you in your new position as Pattern CEO?</p>
<p><strong>Bosch:</strong> I believe it will help in a couple of ways. I was really fortunate to have my time at DEP because it not only expanded my regional view of the world, but it also helped me understand how a very large government organization works—anything from funding and procurement, planning for huge infrastructure projects and planning for some small ones. I learned how that was done, the methodology behind it and the thinking that goes into it. When I talk to our government officials around the region, I understand the process they have to go through to do the work they need to do and (therefore) I am not coming at this with a skewed perspective…</p>
<p>When you are a journalist you would have to schedule the stories you would do for the week and when you do that, at least when it was at the (<em>Middletown Times-Herald</em>) <em>Record</em>, every story that we said we were going to do we were then forced to answer a really important question: “Why should the reader care?” And that is a guide stone that essentially said you are not working on hobby stuff. Let’s make sure you are working on something that really has a critical touch point to our readers. And I think of that from a Pattern perspective. As we choose the projects that we work on, as we choose the topics we are going to focus on, as we think about how to deliver that information to the people that need to hear it, I have to be constantly thinking about why do they care? In other words, how does it affect them in a real way?</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI) waned 4.1% to 104.9 in February. Year-over-year, transactions dropped 5.4%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON— Pending home sales slipped in February, marking four consecutive months of transaction decreases, according to the National Association of Realtors. Three of the four major U.S. regions saw contract signings fall month-over-month, with the Northeast being the only area that reported an increase. All four regions registered a decline in year-over-year contract activity.</p>
<p>The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI) waned 4.1% to 104.9 in February. Year-over-year, transactions dropped 5.4%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p>
<p>Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI rose 1.9% to 85.0 in February, a 9.2% drop from a year ago, NAR reported on March 25.</p>
<p>“Pending transactions diminished in February mainly due to the low number of homes for sale,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR&#8217;s chief economist. “Buyer demand is still intense, but it&#8217;s as simple as ‘one cannot buy what is not for sale.’”</p>
<p>Along with climbing home prices, Yun added that now buyers must grapple with rising mortgage rates and noted that shoppers will likely want to lock in before rates increase further.</p>
<p>“It is still an extremely competitive market, but fast-changing conditions regarding affordability are ahead,” he said. “Consequently, home sellers cannot simply bump up prices in the upcoming months, but need to assess the changing market conditions to attract buyers.”</p>
<p>As of February 2022, higher mortgage rates and sustained price appreciation has led to a year-over-year increase of 28% in mortgage payments.</p>
<p>“The surge in home prices combined with rising mortgage rates can easily translate to another $200 to $300 in mortgage payments per month, which is a major strain for many families already on tight budgets,” Yun added.</p>
<p>Yun forecasts mortgage rates to be about 4.5% to 5% for the remainder of the year and expects about a 7% reduction in home sales in 2022 compared to 2021.</p>
<p>“Home prices themselves are still on solid ground,” he added. “They may rise around 5% by year&#8217;s end and we should see much softer gains in the second half of the year.”</p>
<p>Realtor.com&#8217;s Hottest Housing Markets data in February showed that of the largest 40 metros, the most improved markets over the past year were Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL; Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, FL; Nashville-Davidson, TN; Indianapolis, IN; and San Diego-Carlsbad, CA.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, the index decreased 6.0% to 99.7 last month, down 5.2% from February 2021.</p>
<p>Pending home sales transactions in the South declined 4.4% to an index of 127.2 in February, down 4.3% from February 2021. The index in the West slid 5.4% in February to 90.0, down 5.3% from a year prior.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Residential sales, which include single-family homes, condominiums, co-operatives and 2-4 family multi-family homes, decreased 6.3% in Westchester County, a 28.1% decrease in Putnam County, a 11.6% decrease in Rockland County, a 14.7% decrease in Orange County, and a 19.8% decrease in Sullivan Count]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Residential sales in the first quarter of 2022 in the counties served by OneKey MLS, LLC were down from the historic peaks of 2021, but still posted strong results when compared with 2019 and 2020. The one county served by OneKey MLS that posted stronger numbers in 2022 compared to 2021 was Bronx County which was up 6.1% with 613 residential sales posted in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Residential sales, which include single-family homes, condominiums, co-operatives and 2-4 family multi-family homes, decreased 6.3% in Westchester County, a 28.1% decrease in Putnam County, a 11.6% decrease in Rockland County, a 14.7% decrease in Orange County, and a 19.8% decrease in Sullivan County. One bright spot when comparing 2022 sales to 2021 sales was the condominium market in Westchester County, which saw a 27.8% increase in the number of transactions.</p>
<p>While these overall decreases may seem significant at first glance, the significance is diminished when viewed over a two-year period. When comparing the 2022 first quarter residential sales numbers to the first quarter of 2020, the sales numbers in Westchester County increased 26.9%, Putnam County increased 16.7%, Rockland County increased 21.2%, Orange County increased 31.7%, Sullivan County increased 30.5% and Bronx County increased 42.2%.</p>
<p>In all areas served by OneKey MLS, single-family median sales prices continued to rise, with a modest increase of 2.7% in Westchester County, a 21.8% increase in Putnam County, a 14.9% increase in Rockland County, a 10.3% increase in Orange County, a 20.3% increase in Sullivan County and an 11% increase in Bronx County.</p>
<p>For the first quarter of 2022, the average median sales price for single-family homes in Westchester County was $729,000, the average median sales price in Putnam County was $475,038, the average median sales price for Rockland County was $600,000, the average median sales price in Orange County was $375,000, the average median sales price in Sullivan County was $267,000, and the average median sales price for single family homes in Bronx County was $600,000 for the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>It has been apparent for some time that affordability issues are becoming critical in many parts of OneKey’s geography. In 2019, the average median sales price for a single-family home in Westchester County was $600,000, compared with $729,000 for the first quarter of 2022, a 21.5% increase over a three-year period. The fact that the Westchester median sales price increase was the smallest compared to the other OneKey counties at 2.7% YOY may be a sign of sales prices beginning to stabilize and moderate.</p>
<p>A dearth of inventory continues to plague the market in all parts of OneKey’s footprint, and days on market continue to decline. The market is also facing the dual headwinds of rising interest rates and increasing inflation. However, the market continues to exhibit strength in spite of these headwinds as the economy in the Hudson Valley, greater New York City and suburban area continues to rebound from the pandemic. All in all, 2022 is off to a solid start, the OneKey MLS report states. <a href="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-1st-Quarter-Report.pdf">Click Here to read the full report.</a><br />

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Everyone remembers the old children’s rhyme, “First Comes Love, Then Comes Marriage,” but within the past few years there’s been a growing trend for couples of all ages to put real estate deals first before marriage, or in some cases, just forgo that stroll down the aisle altogether.</p>
<p>According to a recent Realtor.com survey, 31% of all Americans and 41% of 18-to-34-year-olds indicate they’ve purchased a primary residence with someone who is not their spouse. In addition, 55% of Americans and 68% of 18-to-34-year-olds say they would consider buying property with a partner who is not a spouse.</p>
<p>The survey showed the most common co-buyers are romantic partners who are not engaged or married (15%). However, Americans are also open to buying with extended family members or roommates.</p>
<p>Andrea Collins, Home Insight Expert with Hippo Insurance, an InsurTech firm offering homeowners insurance in almost all 50 states, notes that many couples are now skipping expensive weddings and instead, diving head-first into home purchases. “Couples need to have a very clear picture of each other’s financial status—including savings, student loans and other debt—prior to purchasing a home together,” said Collins. “Then, they need to have a solid discussion around the plans with the property and future financial goals.”</p>
<p>Some of the items that couples need to consider are who will be named on the mortgage and title, will they need a property agreement, will they be living full time at the property and who will get the tax deductions?</p>
<p>Collins recommended that partners secure an attorney to help draft a property agreement to avoid any legal troubles in the future. “A property agreement is a legally binding document that dictates the share of finances when it comes to paying off the mortgage, utilities and other household expenses, and most will include information on who will own the property in the event of a breakup or change in plans,” she explained.</p>
<p>In addition to unmarried couples considering home ownership together, Collins noted that there are also other non-traditional homebuyers out there including friends who want to increase their wealth and can’t afford to buy something alone, and family members who have decided they want to own a property together.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-40459" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Couples-Story-Graphic2.png" alt="" width="400" height="542" />Anthony Ruperto, an agent with J.Philip Real Estate LLC in Briarcliff Manor, has dealt with several unmarried couples—both straight and gay—who are seeking to buy a home together. “The majority of those who I see tend to be younger—under 35—and many have plans to be married in the future,” he said. “I’ve also had people who have been together for 15 to 20 years and just don’t want to get married.”</p>
<p>Many of Ruperto’s clients are also from the LGBT community and are not currently considering marriage. “I personally don’t see marriage as a requirement for buying a home together,” he revealed. For those who choose to forgo marriage, Ruperto recommends discussing their purchase with an attorney to set up contingency plans should they break up.</p>
<p>After almost three years together with his partner, Ruperto said they would be looking to purchase a home together in the Beacon area of Dutchess County, where they current reside. As far as married versus unmarried clients, Ruperto said there’s really no difference in the way they search for homes. “Some people have very similar tastes, while others are opposite,” he added. “In fact, I’m working with a married couple now who have been together over 15 years. Whenever one of them likes a home, the other doesn’t, so it’s been very tough to find something for them.”</p>
<p>A recent home ownership survey conducted by Hippo found that 39% of single respondents who purchased a home with a partner were from the western part of the U.S., while 30% hailed from the South, and 22% from the Northeast. Less than 10% lived in the Midwest.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen that regional trends can loosely tie to professional hubs and higher cost housing markets,” said Collins. The survey also found that about 80% of those partners purchased single-family homes, as opposed to multi-family dwellings, condominiums or co-operative apartments.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Furniture Sharehouse, one of the many charities supported by the Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation, recently celebrated 15 years of serving Westchester County at its modest location at the Westchester County Airport in White Plains.</p>
<p>“We could not have reached this amazing milestone without the incredible support of the HG Realtor Foundation and others who have made this organization possible,” said Kate Bialo, Founder and Executive Director of Furniture Sharehouse. Currently, the organization receives no state or county funding. About $50,000 of its budget comes from grants and the remainder is from individual donations.</p>
<p>Westchester County Executive George Latimer, along with other elected officials, was on hand at an April 6 reception at the Furniture Sharehouse headquarters to congratulate Bialo and her many volunteers. “So many of us have a good idea—something that we think will really help someone else. But how many times do you ever see that good idea actually become a reality?” asked Latimer. “But Kate Bialo and the people around her took an idea and turned it into this, which has helped so many people throughout our county.”</p>
<p>Latimer also presented Bialo with a special Westchester County Proclamation acknowledging the work of Furniture Sharehouse over the past 15 years. “Thank you for all you have done. It’s a magnificent accomplishment,” he added.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Furniture Sharehouse has helped more than 16,000 people, including some 7,800 children, by providing basic home furnishings like sofas, chairs, kitchen tables and beds. In 2021, the non-profit helped almost 300 families.</p>
<p>It was back in 2006, that Bialo started to formulate the idea for Furniture Sharehouse. As a past President of the Junior League of Westchester, she was involved with the Golden Shoestring thrift shop in Larchmont. “They didn’t handle large items like furniture and I thought it would be nice if we had a space to hold furniture for so many people who are really in need of it,” she recalled.</p>
<p>After obtaining funding from the Junior League, as well as the Westchester County Emergency Shelter Grant Program, Bialo began to search the county for affordable spaces. “Nothing seemed right, but then someone showed us our current space at the airport,” she said. “At the time, I had my seven-year-old daughter with me and she just looked at me and said, ‘Mommy this is it.’”</p>
<div id="attachment_40480" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40480" class="wp-image-40480" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Image-2.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-40480" class="wp-caption-text">Furniture Sharehouse, Westchester County Airport in White Plains.</p></div>
<p>Furniture Sharehouse held its Grand Opening in 2007, and within just days, a severe storm flooded parts of Mamaroneck. “All of a sudden, people wanted to donate furniture, but we also had to raise money to buy new mattresses,” she said. Within six weeks, they were able to furnish 65 families who had lost their belongings in the flooding. “It was that event that actually put us on the map here in Westchester,” she said.</p>
<p>What started out with just 2,000 square feet in 2007 has now grown to 6,500 square feet. Today, Furniture Sharehouse works with more than 30 member agencies who refer clients to them. Most of the staff consists of about a dozen volunteers, with the exception of a paid part-time administrator, and a driver to deliver the furniture. While the furniture is free to those who qualify, there is a $75 curbside delivery fee or a $150 fee for moving the furniture into the home.</p>
<p>A basic furniture package for a household with nothing includes two beds, a table, chairs, sofa, arm chair, coffee table, end table, dresser, a mirror, lamps and some household items. “Some of the people we help are those moving out of homeless shelters, young people who have aged out of foster care, people who have been the victims of flooding or fires, domestic violence survivors, and others with physical or mental disabilities,” Bialo noted.</p>
<p>“The thing that I feel most often is gratitude, when I get to the warehouse, look around and see people doing so many things,” she said. “It’s heartwarming to see these amazing volunteers come here week after week to this place that’s either freezing cold in the winter or boiling hot in the summer, with no running water or a bathroom. We’ve had to rely on a Port-o-Potty for years!”</p>
<p>Now that the pandemic is winding down, Bialo looks forward to having clients come back in to choose their own furniture, instead of having volunteers select it for them. “We like being able to do in-person appointments and provide that personal touch,” she said.</p>
<p>And as for the furniture recipients, Bialo described “binders of thank you letters” in appreciation. “One of my favorite notes is from a young man who had just gotten out of prison,” she remembered. “He was in a very low place in his life and heard about us from a caseworker. He couldn’t believe a place like this existed and he said it restored his faith in the world.”</p>
<p>Furniture Sharehouse accepts monetary or furniture donations. The items donated must be in good condition and must also be “apartment-sized” for people living in small apartments with narrow halls and stairways. Donation guidelines can be found on their website at <a href="http://www.furnituresharehouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.furnituresharehouse.org</a>.</p>
<p>The HG Realtor Foundation has been providing both financial and volunteer support for Furniture Sharehouse over the past several years. Both Gail Fattizzi, Hudson Gateway Realtor Foundation President, former HGAR President and Regional Manager of ERA Insite Realty Services, and Meg Callaci, a Realtor with Corcoran Legends, serve on the Furniture Sharehouse Board of Directors.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[NAR partnered with Morning Consult for its latest study, 2022 Obstacles to Home Buying, which explores current obstacles to home buying broken down by race/ethnicity.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><h4><em>“In the current hot market, people who have traditionally enjoyed homeownership can capitalize on those gains to realize new opportunities. Meanwhile, the market becomes increasingly unaffordable, and the obstacles greater, for those trying to enter the market.” </em></h4>
<p>WASHINGTON—The lack of affordable homes is the top obstacle holding back potential home buyers of all races, but other obstacles to homeownership varied by race/ethnicity according to a new report released on April 12 by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>NAR partnered with Morning Consult for its latest study, 2022 Obstacles to Home Buying, which explores current obstacles to home buying broken down by race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>The report compares the experiences of both potential and successful home buyers across races and ethnicities. The biggest challenges identified are a lack of affordable homes, a lack of homes that fit their criteria, competing with multiple offers and saving for a down payment.</p>
<p>“Record-high home prices and record-low inventory have made the home buying process exceedingly difficult,” said Dr. Jessica Lautz, NAR vice president of demographics and behavioral insights. “Our new study shows that while the inventory crisis is affecting potential buyers of every race, nearly all home buyers agree that homeownership is still an important part of the American Dream.”</p>
<p>The findings show the second-ranking obstacle faced among potential Hispanic buyers was difficulty saving for a down payment. For potential Black home buyers, lack of credit or credit issues was the second-highest concern, while for White and Asian potential buyers it was a lack of homes that fit their criteria.</p>
<p>“In the current hot market, people who have traditionally enjoyed homeownership can capitalize on those gains to realize new opportunities. Meanwhile, the market becomes increasingly unaffordable, and the obstacles greater, for those trying to enter the market,” said Bryan Greene, NAR vice president of policy advocacy. “NAR advocates not only for existing homeowners, but also for those aspiring homeowners whose entrance into the market is necessary for the economy to thrive.”</p>
<p>Approximately three-quarters of potential home buyers are currently planning to save for a down payment, which most noted it will take between six months and three years to accumulate the necessary funds.</p>
<p>Among buyers who were successful in attaining homeownership, the new report found Asian respondents (51%) were more likely than White (32%), Hispanic (35%), or Black (33%) respondents to say a lack of affordable homes was an obstacle in their home purchase. The second-biggest obstacle White and Asian buyers faced was competing with multiple offers, while for Black buyers it was finding neighborhoods in which the buyers were comfortable.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The legislative and judicial landscape continues to change for New York real estate licensees and the entire real estate industry. New developments are taking place each day and now, more than ever, it is important for real estate licensees and real estate professionals to keep up to date with all of the changes.</p>
<p>As discussed in previous columns, new decisions (DOS Decisions) issued by the New York State Department of State Office of Administrative Hearings relating to the fair housing complaints filed by the Department of State Division of Licensing Services (DLS) as a result of the <em>Newsday </em>Investigation (see <a href="https://bit.ly/38HiXog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/38HiXog</a>) continue to come down and it is important to review these decisions as they offer important guidance.</p>
<p>Additionally, new important legislation has been introduced that will greatly affect the real estate industry. On April 20th, the new rules relating to the implementation of “standardized operating procedures” for real estate brokerages are set to take effect. The requirement for the standardized operating procedures arose directly out of the fair housing investigation conducted by <em>Newsday</em>. HGAR’s in-house counsel, Brian Levine, Esq., provided a detailed review of the requirements under the new regulations in his <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-standard-operating-procedures-sops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April column</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DLS v. <em>Anderson</em>: Substantial Evidence and Disparate Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In <em>DLS</em> v. <em>Anderson</em> (December 10, 2021) (see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3JucvxJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3JucvxJ</a>), an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) found that there was not substantial evidence that the agent engaged in discrimination in violation of federal and state fair housing laws. In New York, the New York State Division of Human Rights offers a publication entitled the “Fair Housing Guide” (see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3O3597w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3O3597w</a>). The Fair Housing Guide is an important resource and should be reviewed by all real estate licensees as well as any professional offering services in the field of real estate. In Anderson, the ALJ points out that it is the burden of the DLS “to prove, by substantial evidence, the truth of the charges set forth in the complaint.” The DLS alleged that the real estate licensee “demonstrated untrustworthiness and/or incompetence by engaging in unlawful discriminatory conduct with respect to her dealings with Mr. Williams and Mr. Fusco. To qualify for a real estate agent’s license, the respondent must be both trustworthy and competent in order ‘to safeguard the interests of the public.’ Real Property Law (“RPL”) § 441(1)(b).”</p>
<p>The DLS in <em>Anderson</em> alleged that the agent’s actions amounted to discriminatory behavior because of the disparate treatment of one customer over another. The agent required a loan pre-approval letter from the Black tester and did not require one of the White tester. The ALJ, citing the U.S. Supreme Court in<em> Int’l Bhd. Of Teamsters v. United States</em> (431 U.S. 324 (1977)), explains that “disparate treatment’ occurs when a person ‘treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Proof of discriminatory motive is critical.’” The ALJ, however, pointed out that while disparate treatment can be used as evidence of discrimination, “unlawful discriminatory conduct must be proven by substantial evidence.” While the ALJ did concede that the agent did engage in disparate treatment, it held that the DLS did not present sufficient evidence at the hearing establishing that disparate treatment by the agent was motivated by a discriminatory intent.</p>
<p>The ALJ focused on the facts and circumstances of the case and explained that the meetings with the respective clients occurred nearly three months apart. The ALJ pointed out that the agent was a newly licensed salesperson when meeting with the Black customer and while she did not require a loan pre-approval letter at first, when she asked her broker for guidance because she was new, she then ultimately requested a pre-approval from him. However, at the hearing, the agent testified that when she met with the White customer three months later, she felt more comfortable in assessing the situation herself and did not ask for one. The ALJ held that the agent’s testimony was credible and that the DLS, without offering sufficient evidence to establish discriminatory intent, did not establish that the agent intentionally discriminated against the Black customer.</p>
<p><strong>DLS v. <em>Nasti and Elliot</em>: The Broker’s Duty to Supervise</strong></p>
<p>In DLS v. <em>Nasti and Elliot</em>, the ALJ revoked the licenses of both the salesperson and the broker. In <em>Nasti</em>, the DLS complaint alleged that the respondent Anthony Nasti, a licensed associate broker, and David Elliot, a licensed real estate salesperson, engaged in unlawful discriminatory conduct, misleading, unauthorized, and unlawful advertising, and that Nasti failed to properly supervise respondent Elliot.</p>
<p>The salesperson was in contact with a person (i.e., Ms. Asari-Vojka) who was employed by the Malaysian government and who was assisting with an apartment search for a diplomatic couple. In Nasti, the ALJ points out that the salesperson asked about the couple’s country of origin “…and when he was advised it was Malaysia he told Ms. Asari-Vojka that the management of the building in question did not accept Malaysian diplomats as tenants. The ALJ further points out, “…however, to avoid issues of diplomatic immunity the building did not rent to any diplomatic mission, although it would rent to diplomats as individuals, a fact of which the respondents were aware.”</p>
<p>In <em>Nasti</em>, the ALJ points out that “pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §3604 and to the New York State Human Rights Law, Executive Law §296 (5) (a), it is unlawful for any person to discriminate in the rental of real property on the basis of national origin.” Further, under §175.25(b) of the Department of State’s Rules and Regulations, “…a violation by a real estate salesperson or broker of either of those statutes is grounds for the imposition of disciplinary sanctions up to and including license revocation.” In this case, the ALJ held that not only was the agent’s refusal to lease to the couple because they were Malaysian diplomats a violation of the law warranting revocation, but it also further held that the broker failed to supervise the agent and revoked the broker’s license as well.</p>
<p>In my January 2022 column (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3xkryHI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3xkryHI</a>), it was pointed out that the New York Court of Appeals issued a landmark decision in <em>Roberts Real Estate, Inc. v. Department of State</em> (80 NY2d 116, 589 NYS2d 392 (1992)). The Court of Appeals held that when a supervising broker is unaware (i.e., does not have “actual knowledge”) of the actions of a salesperson and upon finding that the salesperson has acted improperly, even where there may be a failure to supervise, the penalty to the principal broker is limited to a fine pursuant to Real Property Law § 442-c. Revocation of Mr. Nasti’s license was not supported by the record or the law. In fact, surprisingly, the ALJ stated that Mr. Nasti “…offered no evidence that would reasonably lead to the conclusion that he was unaware of Mr. Elliot’s discriminatory conduct.” As indicated previously, the burden is on the DLS to prove by substantial evidence that Mr. Nasti was aware of what transpired, it was not Mr. Nasti’s burden to prove he was not aware after he and the agent testified that he had no knowledge of what transpired. After issuance of the ALJ’s decision, the respondents filed a motion to stay same, which has been granted, and the decision is currently being appealed.</p>
<p><strong>Broker’s Added Requirements: Standardized </strong><strong>Operating Procedures Effective April 20th</strong></p>
<p>In light of recent DOS Decisions, and additional legislative obligations, brokers must be very careful when operating their real estate brokerage firms. As indicated in January’s column (see <a href="https://bit.ly/3xkryHI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3xkryHI</a>), recent legislation requires that associate brokers who serve as office managers must now supervise other licensed salespersons and associate brokers in their office. Additionally, in order to qualify to be appointed as an office manager, the associate broker “…must have been active in the real estate industry two of the four years before beginning duties as office manager.” This new legislation now holds an associate broker, who is an office manager, to the same oversight standards of a principal broker, including the same standard and duty to supervise agents.</p>
<p>The standardized operating procedures, which were part of the newly enacted legislation (S.2131-A/A.618 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3zQfDAH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3zQfDAH</a>]) amending § 442-h of the Real Property Law by adding subdivision 4, have been issued by the Secretary of State and are set to go into effect on April 20th. The DOS provides that the following minimum prerequisites must be met and contained in the required standardized operating procedures before any services are provided to homebuyers: (i) whether prospective clients shall show identification; (ii) whether an exclusive broker agreement is required; and (iii) whether pre-approval for a mortgage loan is required (see <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3vsACb9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://on.ny.gov/3vsACb9</a>). Initially, the legislation required that every broker file a copy of the standardized operating procedures with the DOS, however, that requirement was removed by agreement with the Governor’s office in March 2022.</p>
<p>The DOS requires that by April 20th “…every real estate broker, operating within the State of New York, shall have on each publicly available website and mobile device application they maintain a list of standardized operating procedures.” It also requires that “…each publicly available website and mobile device application operated by an associated agent or ‘team’ of such broker, shall have posted their broker’s standardized operating procedures or a direct link to such information on their broker’s website.” If these are not in place by April 20th, both the broker and agent(s) will be subject to discipline. Brokers should contact their IT professionals right away to ensure that they are in compliance with the new regulations.</p>
<p>Additionally, brokers are required to keep an archive of all standardized operating procedures “for as long as they are actively licensed” and any amendments to the operating procedures must be “date stamped and notarized.” The DOS requires that any newly adopted procedures are to be “…posted and made available, at each brokerage office and online, within 30 days of any changes.” The New York State Association of Realtors has also provided very helpful guidance (see <a href="https://bit.ly/36137Ux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/36137Ux</a>) regarding the new regulations and has provided a form template that brokers may utilize (see <a href="https://bit.ly/38IOvtV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/38IOvtV</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Keeping Up With the Changes</strong></p>
<p>Brokers and agents should make it a habit of reviewing the decisions issued by the DOS every month as this will allow them to understand the issues that affect their industry. The DOS decisions provide critical, real-life examples of the difficulties faced by licensees every day. It is also critical that they keep up with the ever-changing regulatory landscape. As is evident, these new regulations seem to sneak up on the industry and keeping pace with the news and new legislative initiatives will make it that much easier to operate a brokerage business and implement new requirements more efficiently.</p>

<p>Specifically, the real estate trade organizations voiced their staunch support for the bill, A. 6152A (Philip Steck D-Colonie) / S. 4740A (James Sanders Jr., D-Rochdale Village, Far Rockaway). The bill, which recently passed through the New York State Assembly, would require the elimination of any illegal restrictive covenants prior to the sale of real estate, which would specifically perpetuate housing discrimination by forbidding sales based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, disability, national origin, source of income or ancestry.</p>
<div id="attachment_40548" style="width: 177px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40548" class="size-medium wp-image-40548" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lisa-DeRosa-1-167x250.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-40548" class="wp-caption-text">BRI President Lisa DeRosa</p></div>
<p>“It is inconceivable that today’s homeowners would agree with the values and the intentions of this binding legal language. But it is also clear that absent strong motivation, it is easier to ignore the past than come to terms with and remedy past wrongs,” HGAR President Anthony Domathoti and BRI President Lisa DeRosa wrote in their April 7th letter to the Senators.</p>
<p>As with so many suburban and urban areas throughout the United States, restrictive covenants that perpetuate housing discrimination, particularly those that explicitly forbid sales of the property to buyers who are not “of the White or Caucasian race,” are still to be found in deeds throughout Westchester County and the communities of New York State, HGAR and BRI officials stated.</p>
<p>These covenants played a deliberate role in enforcing racial and other segregation in housing, particularly in suburban communities, throughout the 20th century. However, despite being illegal and declared unenforceable by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1940s, many of these covenants continued to be written into housing deeds for decades after the Supreme Court decision as both an implicit and explicit statement of values as to who was welcome within a community and who was not.</p>
<p>“It is important for those of us working in real estate, housing, and land use today to recognize the role that discrimination and prejudice played not just in the attitudes of previous generations of those who built, owned, or facilitated the sale of homes and property, but in the laws and the systems they set up,” the letter stated. “Restrictive covenants did not originate as some exception to our nation’s ideals. They were actively supported by Realtors, developers, neighborhood associations, the Public Works Administration that encouraged their widespread adoption before proposed projects within a community could be approved and the Federal Housing Administration, which would not provide financing for new housing in many communities absent these discriminatory clauses.”</p>
<p>They added that these restrictive covenants were designed “to promote one set of citizens over another, with a particular animus toward low- and middle-income African American families and other communities of color.</p>
<p>“We believe it is time for New York to join Maryland, Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey in requiring the removal of this poison from our laws and our homes,” the letter concluded.</p>
<p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty said it would be fitting if the State Senate joined the Assembly in passing S. 4740A during Fair Housing Month and Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the bill into law so that once and for all these discriminatory restrictive covenants can be eliminated in deed documents in New York State.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>PEARL RIVER—Momentive Performance Materials Inc. is relocating its operations in Tarrytown to nearly 67,000 square feet of space at the 207-acre Hudson Valley iCampus property here in 2023.</p>
<p>Momentive Performance, which is headquartered in Waterford, (Saratoga County) NY will relocate from its current space at 769 Old Saw Mill River Road in Tarrytown in early 2023 across the Hudson River to its new Global Innovation Center totaling 66,430 square feet. The Hudson Valley iCampus is owned by Industrial Realty Group, LLC.</p>
<p>Momentive’s new GIC facility at Hudson Valley iCampus will feature modern office and laboratory space within what the company terms is a collaborative atmosphere of innovation, fostered by campus leaders and neighboring companies such as Pfizer Inc., RK Pharma Solutions, Sanofi, and more. The mixed-use campus features laboratory, office, GMP manufacturing space, and build-to-suit options, which allow maximum flexibility for Momentive’s future growth, the company stated.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited to welcome the Momentive team to the Hudson Valley iCampus,” said Jamie Schwartz, President of Hudson Valley iCampus. “We’re proud Momentive recognized the value of our first-class management team, existing infrastructure, and location. The GIC will be in good company on our campus, where we have created an environment conducive to innovation, ingenuity and industry that offers an outstanding setting for long-term growth.”</p>
<p>IRG’s Schwartz said that Momentive will move into what is now a vacant building that totals approximately 170,000 square feet of space. The plan calls for extensive renovations to be undertaken to the building and Momentive’s future space.</p>
<p>“This move is representative of Momentive’s enduring commitment to help solve each of our customers’ needs around the world with high-performance, trend-driven innovative products, and solutions, just as we have for 75 years,” said V.P. Nalian, President and General Manager of Momentive’s Performance Additives business unit.</p>
<p>John Nicholson, Global Technology Leader, Performance Additives, added that he also sees Momentive’s new GIC as a vibrant hub of scientific discovery and materials innovation, contributing to enhanced product performance across a broad range of industry applications for the Agricultural, Paint &amp; Coatings, and Beauty and Personal Care markets, which, he said, “will help meet the demand for high-performing, practical solutions for a sustainable world.”</p>
<p>Momentive Performance Materials, Inc., is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of MOM Holding Company, and is one of the world’s largest producers of silicones and silicone derivatives.</p>
<p>Andrew Tarvin of Tarvin Commercial Real Estate Services represented Momentive in the transaction. Schwartz, Onno Steger, Senior Vice President of IRG, and John Cunningham, Senior Vice President of JLL, represented the property ownership in the deal.</p>
<p>Current tenants at Hudson Valley iCampus include: Pfizer, Inc.; Auro Vaccines; RK Pharma, Inc.; Sanofi US Services, Inc.; and Urban Electric Power, Inc. The site is managed by IRG affiliate IRG Realty Advisors, LLC.</p>
<p>The nearly 2-million-square-foot Hudson Valley iCampus previously served as Lederle Laboratories’ R&amp;D, laboratory, manufacturing and headquarters, dating to the early 1900s. The property was later transferred to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Pfizer acquired Wyeth and the original 240-acre property in 2009 and sold 207 acres and 25 buildings to IRG in 2015.</p>
<p>Schwartz said that there is currently approximately 1.5 million square feet of space available at Hudson Valley iCampus. Pfizer leases approximately 220,000 square feet of space in multiple buildings as well as a hundreds of thousands of square feet on an adjoining parcel of approximately 30 acres that Pfizer owns.</p>
<p>He added that there is a considerable amount of potential leased space in the pipeline and that he expects further transactions will be announced before the end of this year.</p>
<p>IRG announced last month it will begin construction on two sites near The Port of Virginia, part of a collective build-to-suit project for 3PL tenant, UNIS, LLC. The project will include a 910,000-square-foot, high-volume, cross dock terminal in Suffolk, VA and a 72,000-square foot transload facility in Portsmouth, VA.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—The most consequential economic development project for the mid-Hudson Valley region in decades is not a major corporate relocation, a large lease deal or a new massive warehouse developed by a national e-commerce giant. Instead, it will be a major infrastructure project that will surely facilitate mega deals like those mentioned above in the coming years.</p>
<p>Advocates for the expansion of Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties learned on April 9 that their efforts had borne fruit as Gov. Kathy Hochul in touting her record $32.8-billion, five-year capital plan for the New York State Department of Transportation noted that the state would earmark up to $1 billion of the capital plan to “accelerate the conversion of the Route 17 corridor in Orange and Sullivan counties to Interstate 86, fueling transformative levels of economic growth in the region and improving quality of life by alleviating congestion.”</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Transportation is now expected to begin the environmental study on the Route 17 expansion project based on a final report from the New York State Department of Transportation’s Route 17 Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) Study group released in November 2021. The PEL report recommended the state move forward with an environmental review of a General Use Third Lane in each direction on Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties that could if built as one major project cost anywhere from $650 million to $1.27 billion. The PEL Study Group also called for a study of interchange upgrades be undertaken at exits in Orange and Sullivan counties and that improvements be made in the region to improve connectivity to existing transit.</p>
<p>While Gov. Hochul had called for NYSDOT to begin the environmental review process in her State of the State message earlier this year, her announcement earlier this month of a funding commitment of up to $1 billion is seen by project advocates as a major victory.</p>
<p>“We thank Gov. Kathy Hochul and the State Legislature for making Route 17 a priority for investment,” said 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair Maureen Halahan, President and CEO of the Orange County Partnership. “This project will improve mobility and safety in the region by making much-needed upgrades to Route 17. It’s been a long road to this point, and we’re overjoyed to see this project finally move forward now that the necessary resources have been allocated.”</p>
<p>17-Forward-86 is a coalition of industry, trade and civic representatives that has been advocating for adding an additional travel lane along Route 17 to convert the corridor to Interstate 86 in Orange and Sullivan counties.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the governor and our local, state and federal lawmakers—and to the thousands of stakeholders working with us to see this project become a reality,” said 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair Marc Baez, President and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership. “This is good news for our residents, visitors, first-responders and all those who travel Route 17. We now have the chance to improve safety on this corridor and ensure sustainability for generations to come.”</p>
<p>The 17-Forward 86 coalition recently hosted a rally at the Galleria at Crystal Run in the Town of Wallkill with local, state and federal representatives to urge Gov. Hochul and state legislators to commit construction funding as part of the NYSDOT capital plan by using part of the more than $5 billion in additional funding earmarked for New York State under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</p>
<p>“As New York State continues to rebuild, we must seize opportunities to get our local economy back on track,” said Greg Lalevee, Business Manager, IUOE Local 825, and member of the 17-Forward-86 Coalition. “One of the surest ways to do that is to get people to work and to attract investments here in Orange and Sullivan counties. Infrastructure plays a key role in all of this and upgrading the Route 17 corridor will go a long way toward helping our region recover and prosper. The construction project itself will create good-paying jobs and the end result will be a safer and more efficient means of transportation for all residents and visitors in the Hudson Valley.”</p>
<p>According to the final PEL Study Group report, the scope of the construction of the General Use Third Lane beginning at Exit 131 in Harriman (Orange County) to Exit 103 (Rapp Road) in Monticello in Sullivan County would determine the cost of the project.</p>
<p>Option 1, which involves using the basic existing footprint of the roadway and shoulders to accommodate a third lane in each direction would cost $385 million to $470 million for the Orange County stretch of roadway and another $265 million to $325 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>Under Option 2, which would involve widening the existing roadway to accommodate the third lane expansions in both directions so that most of Route 17 would conform to federal Interstate standards, the costs would escalate. For the Orange County section, the cost would run between $615 million to $750 million, while the Sullivan County component’s cost ranges from $425 million to $520 million.</p>
<p>The PEL Study Group did not recommend one option over the other and also while listing interchanges in Orange and Sullivan counties that could be upgraded, it did not issue any specific recommendations, although it did point out those with the greatest need.</p>
<p>The study indicated the cost of the interchange upgrades in Orange County could run from $135 million to $175 million and in Sullivan County from $43 million to $144 million.</p>
<p>Improvements to Connectivity to Existing Transit projects are projected to cost between $1 million to $1.5 million in Sullivan County and $9 million to $10 million in Orange County.</p>
<p>While study group officials have stated at previous virtual public workshops that the full project would likely not move forward all at once due to funding constraints and other factors, the report listed the total project cost involving the construction of the General Use Third Lane, interchange improvements and improvements to connectivity to existing transit projects would run from $529 million to $935 million in Orange County and $309 million to $665.5 million in Sullivan County.</p>
<p>The Route 17 expansion will qualify for some federal funding. However, it is likely that the overall project would be done in phases and based on the report it appears work would begin on a stretch of the roadway in Orange County.</p>
<p>“As previously noted, NYSDOT will determine the logical termini and specific project limits of the General Use Third Lane Alternative in the future, following careful consideration of existing and projected traffic congestion, public and agency input, and available funding,” the report stated. “Based on this Route 17 PEL Study, the area of greatest need appears to be between Exits 120 (NY Route 211 – Wallkill) and 131 (Woodbury), a distance of approximately 22 miles, and the segment of the corridor that is projected to experience the highest levels of congestion in the year 2055.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[With the property so close to HGAR, it seemed only appropriate that Real Estate In-Depth take a closer look at this property by asking “Five Questions” to Epoch Senior Living Founder, President and CEO Larry Gerber.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Last month, partners Epoch Senior Living and National Development opened the doors for the first time to their new $120-million Waterstone of Westchester luxury senior housing project in Downtown White Plains.</p>
<p>The independent living facility for those 62 and older offers everything a five-star hotel would offer and more. The 132-unit property is located across from Bloomingdales and just down the block on Bloomingdale Road from Whole Foods and the headquarters of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. Monthly rents at Waterstone of Westchester range from approximately $8,000 to $12,000 depending on the size of the unit and services rendered.</p>
<p>With the property so close to HGAR, it seemed only appropriate that <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> take a closer look at this property by asking “Five Questions” to Epoch Senior Living Founder, President and CEO Larry Gerber.</p>
<p>Gerber founded Epoch Senior Living in 1997 and since then the company has opened 14 senior assisted and independent living properties in Connecticut, New England and now New York with a few others in development. The Waterstone of Westchester marks the Waltham, MA-based company’s entrance into the New York marketplace.</p>
<p>From 1991 to 1997, Gerber was President and CEO of the Berkshire Group, a privately held firm with subsidiaries in long-term care, multifamily real estate and mortgage banking industries with more than $10 billion in assets under management. From 1984 to 1990, he served in various senior executive capacities with Berkshire, with responsibilities for real estate acquisitions, mortgage banking, fundraising and strategic planning. Under his direction, Harborside Healthcare, the long-term care subsidiary of Berkshire, successfully completed an IPO and grew to more than 5,000 long-term care beds. While at Berkshire, Gerber also served as President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Berkshire Realty Company and Chairman of Berkshire Mortgage Company. Prior to joining Berkshire, he was a management consultant with Bain &amp; Company and a senior tax accountant with Arthur Andersen &amp; Company.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Epoch Senior Living and National Development recently opened its 132-unit, 62+ Waterstone of Westchester independent senior living facility in White Plains. Can you explain why you chose White Plains for your first independent senior living facility in New York State and how has interest been in leasing at the property?</p>
<p><strong>Gerber:</strong> In answering that I would say that we really chose Westchester County as a target and we are finding that we draw from throughout Westchester County, obviously more from Scarsdale and White Plains and the nearby towns. We have residents coming from Southern Fairfield County, CT, including Greenwich, and we have some coming from believe it or not Manhattan and Florida because they have children living in the Westchester area. We try to do the Waterstones in what I would describe as an ‘urbanized suburban setting.’</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-40604" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/waterstone-of-westchester.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" />When we have people considering another property other than a Waterstone, most often they are considering a CCRC (Continuing Care Retirement Community) and the reason is there are not many rental communities that are of the caliber that we offer. You tend to find the CCRCs are big so they get some economies of scale and are operated by an independent not-for-profit or some religious-affiliated group where there is some charitable giving that pays for the cost of the building. They tend to be located at these lovely isolated, pastoral campuses. We try to do Waterstone where our residents are part of the community we are (located) in. They are near stores and restaurants, banks and medical care and culture and are walkable or within a very short drive. As you know we offer transportation services for our residents. So, White Plains had undergone a great resurgence in residential life with high-end apartments and condos that have been built. We are across from Bloomingdales and diagonally across from The Westchester and we thought that was an exciting, vibrant community. The first two Waterstones we built—one is in Wellesley, MA and the other is on the Boston-Brookline line. They are also very convenient to retail and there are a lot of busy streets there. So that is also what attracted us to White Plains.</p>
<p>Also, our partners at National Development knew the owners of the office building. It was a pretty complex deal and it was helpful to have parties that knew each other and trusted each other. We wound up basically taking the parking lot for the office building (next door) and building the garage. While the garage was being built, we leased (parking) spaces at Bloomingdales across the street for the office building employees and then when the garage was done, we built our building with additional parking for our residents underneath. It was a complicated deal that took a long time getting done, but we are very proud of it and excited about its opening.</p>
<p>Interest (in Waterstone of Westchester) has been very good. It was slow when we first opened our sales office about two years ago during the worst of the pandemic, so nobody went anywhere. It has really heated up in the last six to eight months or so. Now that the building is open, it is phenomenal. We are ahead of our pro forma in terms of occupancy. Physical occupancy is about 30% and there are dozens of other lease commitments (pending). <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Gerber expects Waterstone of Westchester to be near or at full occupancy in the next year or two.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Based on a tour your firm provided recently of the facility located across from Bloomingdales in White Plains, there is a definite feel of hotel living. Can you explain what you hope to offer residents at Waterstone of Westchester and what sets it apart from other senior properties in the area?</p>
<p><strong>Gerber:</strong> Waterstone offers the sophistication and design elements in the common areas that one would see in a boutique hotel or luxury condo building. When people move in or spend any time at a Waterstone, they feel like a very warm, welcoming and nurturing home. What sets it apart from others is that due to its urbanized setting, it will attract a more active resident who probably skews a little younger than other independent living communities or is more fit and can take advantage of the location and walk across the street to Bloomingdales and things like that. But, what we really offer is a lifestyle of convenience where we offer meals, housekeeping, social and lots of educational activities, a fitness program and an indoor pool. I have heard residents say that they are no longer worried about managing a home anymore and 65 vendors coming to their house.</p>
<p>What we are offering is a care-free lifestyle that fosters wellness and greater independence among our residents than if they were living in a place that didn’t have the supportive services that we have. I think that it is very rare and the level of services and quality of building are not found in most of our rental competitors. … <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Among the services and amenities available at Waterstone of Westchester include: gourmet cuisine, a movie theater, fitness center, indoor pool, lobby bar, art studio and salon. Services include chauffeured car service, garage parking and on-site concierge and access to home care services through an on-site partnership with VNS (Visiting Nurse Service) Westchester.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Earlier this year, your company opened the Waterstone on High Ridge in Stamford, CT, an independent living/assisted living facility. You have a total of 14 properties in Connecticut, New England and now New York. Can you tell us what other properties you have in development and are you looking to expand with other facilities in the Hudson Valley, New York State and the New York metro region in the near future?</p>
<p><strong>Gerber:</strong> We currently have two properties under construction in Lexington, MA, one is a Waterstone and one is Bridges by Epoch Memory Care, a stand-alone memory care building. We are a regional company. We have four properties now between Fairfield County, CT and Westchester. We continue to look for other opportunities in Westchester, but we haven’t seen anything that we have gotten excited about or could work. As a company, and with our terrific partners at National Development, we are really about quality, not quantity for senior housing. I really have no targets for how many we are going to build or how much we are going to grow. We are privately-held. We don’t have a capital partner at the corporate level. We have capital partners on individual buildings. As a regional company in New England, our southern boundary is Westchester County. By design, we want our regional corporate management team to be visiting all of our properties often and be able to get there quickly if necessary. We only consider opportunities where our team (from its headquarters in Waltham, MA) can drive to. If they have to get on a plane or the drive is too long, we rule it out.<strong> Editor’s Note:</strong> Gerber said that during the COVID pandemic, the firm was focused on opening the facilities in the pipeline and by the end of 2022 will open four new facilities—a record for the company.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-40603" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Sun-Room-27.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" />Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Your luxury properties are catered to a certain market segment. Your property locations are in affluent suburban locations. Can you describe your typical resident and what prompts them to lease at your properties?</p>
<p><strong>Gerber:</strong> There is no simple answer to that question. I mean, they include people who are in their early 70s, sometimes even late 60s, and it includes people who are in their late 90s and we have a few who are over 100. … Our residents typically have some financial means. Many were doctors, lawyers, business owners and professionals. However, there are others that have not made as much money through their careers, but through good saving and investing (are able to afford to live at a Waterstone property).</p>
<p>Also, if someone is 85 or 88 years old, and they decide to sell their home in Westchester or in some other nearby suburban locations, a home almost always sells for more than $1 million and often several million dollars. I’ve had retired school teachers who had a house that they bought for $40,000 and sold it for $1.8 million and moved into a Waterstone. So, it’s a more diverse group than you would think, which is very nice. ,,, I think our residents typically are people who appreciate the finer things in life, who are cultured, who are focused on continuing education and who for their generation probably had more of a focus on fitness than some of the others who didn’t make it to that age.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Has rising inflation, which has caused material and labor costs to soar, impacted your expansion and development plans now and in the short term? The Waterstone of Westchester was estimated to cost $120 million to complete. Your firm did receive some incentives from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency in connection with the project’s construction. If you were about to break ground now on this project, what do you estimate the cost would be and would Epoch Senior Living actually break ground on the venture or delay its construction?</p>
<p><strong>Gerber:</strong> The question what the project would cost today to develop is a difficult question in the hypothetical. … There are so many cost components that go into a project that have been inflated at different levels. Without sort of spending a couple of months that it takes to budget construction accurately, factor in construction interest and lease-up reserve and furniture and other things, (it is difficult to calculate). I’d say that since we locked in our costs on this project, material costs have skyrocketed, interest rates are up about 50%, labor costs have increased and delivery costs for everything have pushed prices up. I would venture a guess that costs are up at least 20% to do a project like this. Then there are the operating costs of a community—energy, food and labor are all up by so much. I very much doubt that a project like this would pencil out right now.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—Realtors believe that the lower home sales numbers registered in the first quarter of this year were due primarily to record low inventory and not any sharp decline in buying demand. In fact, brokers interviewed by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> agree that current economic headwinds in the form of high inflation, rising mortgage interest rates and the war in Ukraine have done little to date to dampen buyer enthusiasm.</p>
<p>If these market conditions continue, low inventory will cause lower sales, but in no way will foster any type of market collapse, brokers agreed.</p>
<p>According to the recently released <a href="https://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-HGAR-OneKey-MLS-1st-Quarter-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first quarter 2022 market report for counties served by OneKey MLS, LLC</a>, residential sales were down from the historic peaks of 2021, but still posted strong results when compared with 2019 and 2020. The one county served by OneKey MLS that posted stronger numbers in 2022 compared to 2021 was Bronx County which saw sales increase 6.1% in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Residential sales, which include single-family homes, condominiums, co-operatives and 2-4 family multi-family homes, decreased 6.3% in Westchester County, fell 28.1% in Putnam County, declined 11.6% in Rockland County, decreased 14.7% in Orange County, and were 19.8% lower in Sullivan County. A bright spot when comparing 2022 sales to 2021 sales was the condominium market in Westchester County which saw a 27.8% increase in the number of transactions and an 18.7%. increase in its median sale price to $445,000.</p>
<p>However, the OneKey MLS report stressed that the first quarter 2022 sales market was still strong when the 2022 first quarter residential sales numbers are compared to the first quarter of 2020. Those comparisons indicate that the sales numbers in Westchester County increased 26.9%, Putnam County sales rose 16.7%, Rockland County sales were 21.2% higher, Orange County transactions increased 31.7%, Sullivan County closings shot up 30.5% and Bronx County transactions rose an impressive 42.2%.</p>
<p>In all areas served by OneKey MLS single-family median sales prices continued to rise, with a modest increase of 2.7% in Westchester County to $729,000, a 21.8% increase in Putnam County to $475,038, a 14.9% increase in Rockland County to $600,000, a 10.3% increase in Orange County to $375,000, a 20.3% increase in Sullivan County to $267,000 and an 11% increase in Bronx County to $600,000.</p>
<p>The alarming data continues to be available inventory. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, Westchester’s for-sale single-family home inventory was down 26.5%; Putnam County’s single-family inventory fell 10.9% lower; Rockland County’s single-family inventory plummeted 30.0%; Orange County’s stock of available single-family homes were 9.8% lower; and Sullivan County’s single-family inventory fell 5.4%. Bronx County’s single-family inventory was the outlier with an increase of 18.3% in the number of houses on the market for sale at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>HGAR President Anthony Domathoti, who is Broker/Owner of EXIT Realty Premium of the Bronx, told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that buyer demand was strong in the first quarter of 2022 despite low inventory.</p>
<p>He added that limited inventory will continue to plague the markets in the days to come and available listings will sell fast.</p>
<p>“The market is facing dual headwinds—rising interest rates and increasing inflation,” Domathoti said. “However, the market continues to grow in spite of these challenges as the economy in the Hudson Valley and Greater New York City area continue to rebound from the pandemic. So, all-in-all, 2022 is off to a solid start.”</p>
<p>Rising mortgage interest rates will make home purchases more expensive, which will chip away at home buying demand. He expects slower sales in 2022, but by no means will there be a sharp decline in activity.</p>
<p>Domathoti singled out the Bronx where 477 co-ops were sold last year. “The Bronx is very active right now,” he added. Inventory in the Bronx remains low and available listings are selling very fast.</p>
<p>Joseph Rand, chief creative officer of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, stated in the firm’s first quarter market report that low inventory has suppressed pending transactions. “If anything, the current inventory levels are particularly challenging for pending deals, since those buyers are out looking for homes right now and not finding them,” he said. “Going forward, we do believe that pending sales, like closed sales, will generally track listings. If we can get more fuel for the fire, we will likely be able to keep the flames going through the end of the year. Even with rates increasing, buyer demand is incredibly strong, and we believe that buyers will simply adapt to a higher rate environment by switching to adjustable-rate mortgages or raising their down payments.”</p>
<p>Rand noted that the first quarter closed transactions does not reflect the higher interest rates and that at present, sales are lower not because of the lack of demand, but due to record low inventory,</p>
<p>He added, “I think what we are seeing is (prospective) sellers who don’t want to put their home on the market until they find something to buy and there is just not a lot of stuff to buy, so it’s like this recurring cycle whereby no one puts their home on the market because no one else has put their home on the market.”</p>
<p>Rand said that buyer demand is still strong and if more listings come on the market, sale price appreciation will moderate.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lawrence officials were upbeat on both the conventional and luxury suburban markets in 2022. Liz Nunan, President and CEO of Houlihan Lawrence, said, “There are external factors that can always affect a real estate market. Still, today’s supply and demand ratio indicate that the market will remain a strong seller market for the foreseeable future. If a house is lingering on the market under these conditions, it is very likely the price.”</p>
<p>Anthony P. Cutugno, Senior Vice President, Director of Private Brokerage for Houlihan Lawrence, noted, that suburban luxury home sales in 2020 and 2021 reached record-breaking sales. He said it is unlikely that the pace achieved during the past two years will continue unabated unless supply of luxury homes significantly increases.</p>
<p>Cutugno noted the low supply/high demand environment has generated stiff competition for a dwindling number of listings. Multiple offers have pushed up median selling prices. For example, in Westchester, approximately 38% of first quarter luxury sales closed at a premium over list price—the highest being $1 million above asking price.</p>
<p>He related that the majority of Westchester’s first quarter luxury sales closed below the asking price. “Savvy buyers will overlook unrealistically priced listings to the benefit of well-priced and well-presented homes that are selling more quickly than last year. If a listing is languishing on the market, it is often a sign that pricing should be revisited to capitalize on this robust, but not always euphoric, market,” Cutugno said.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Real estate transactions begin and end with contracts. Lots and lots of contracts. This month, I’m going to address some issues related to these contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Executing a Contract</strong></p>
<p>While an agent is the party who meets with the client (buyer or seller), negotiates all the terms, and does all the “heavy lifting,” it’s the broker who is the party to the contract. In many cases, an agent can be authorized to sign a contract on behalf of the brokerage; therefore, it is a best practice for the brokerage to establish the terms upon which an agent can execute an agreement. Additionally, it’s important that the agent ensures that all the necessary terms are set forth in the contract in clear language.</p>
<p>Make sure the beginning and end dates of the agreement are there. Make sure the commissions or any monetary amounts are established. Make sure any agreed upon conditions, duties and obligations are in plain language. Ensure provisions regarding what happens if the contract expires while a deal is pending are filled out. If using a standardized form, make sure that nothing is left out and a line is drawn through things that are to be left blank/omitted. Most importantly, make sure the date the contract is being executed is included and all the necessary parties sign the contract (If there are multiple sellers, all will need to sign the listing, or a document authorizing a seller to sign on behalf of all should be produced). A contract should always be dated on the date it is executed. Without it, you may not have a valid contract and/or a party could try to intervene and claim that there was a pre-existing contract that supersedes your contract.</p>
<p>And remember: Always provide a copy of the contract to the client. It’s a Code of Ethics requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying or Terminating a Contract</strong></p>
<p>First, changes to or termination of a contract requires the approval of both parties. If an agent is authorized to execute a contract on behalf of a brokerage, they are similarly authorized to modify or terminate a contract on behalf of a brokerage, so it is important for a brokerage to establish the terms upon which an agent can modify or terminate an agreement. It is also important for an agent to remember that, as a licensee, they have a fiduciary duty to their broker to act in the broker’s best interest. This means that an agent should think twice and discuss modifying or canceling any contract with their broker before taking any action. Failure to do so could open the agent up to a lawsuit for damages such as lost commissions, as well as possible Deptarment of State action.</p>
<p>Quite often, a modification to a contract might become necessary during the life of the contract. A change in start dates, commission amounts, showing instructions and other smaller issues may be required. Also, sometimes due to a monetary dispute, it may be necessary for an agent to reduce a commission at the closing table by an agreed-to amount. The need to make changes to a contract are endless and, so long as the parties agree to the changes (best practice is for the agent to discuss any major changes with his/her broker), the contract can be easily modified.</p>
<p>Terminating a contract can be a little trickier. Again remember, both parties must agree to the contract termination. Members of the public may be under the false impression that they can terminate an agreement because they have a right to select their own representation. These two things are separate. While a member of the public does have the right to select his/her own representative, they cannot terminate the agreement without the consent of the brokerage. This means that the person can end the relationship, find another brokerage, and that new brokerage might bring about the sale of their property or that brokerage may be the procuring cause of a transaction; however, the former client may still owe the first brokerage a commission pursuant to the underlying contract with that brokerage if that contract has not expired.</p>
<p>Often, if the desire of both parties is to go their separate ways, there are several options available to the brokerage to terminate the contract. One possible solution is to give the client a full and immediate release. Another possibility is to enter into what is called an “accord and satisfaction.” This is a legal term that means that the parties enter into a contract for the release of the underlying obligations/contract. In exchange for the release, the brokerage can ask for a wide variety of things such as their current costs incurred working with the client, a flat fee, a referral fee for the term of the underlying contract (with the client being required to notify the new brokerage of the agreement). They sky is the limit. Another possibility is that the brokerage refuses to terminate the contract and keeps both parties bound to it for its full term. Keep in mind that, in this situation, the brokerage must still act in the best interests of the client (Code of Ethics). This may mean that, if asked, they will have to take the property off the market, stop showing it, stop marketing it, etc. Additionally, the brokerage will still need to communicate with the client, conduct showings, and even present offers if they are made.</p>
<p>Conversely, a brokerage cannot terminate a contract without the consent of the client. Once again, both parties have to agree to terminate the contract. Further, while a client can terminate the relationship and move on to another brokerage, a licensee has a higher fiduciary duty to the client and they cannot terminate the relationship unless there is some illegal or criminal act begin performed by the client. In short, the brokerage is bound to continue to work with the client until both parties agree to terminate the contract and the relationship. Short of that, the licensee must continue to act in the best interests of the client, even if the client is behaving poorly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The use of contracts establishes duties and obligations between two parties that are legally binding. Neither party alone can break those bonds. The contract provides guarantees and safety to both, so ensure that they are clear and executed properly, that modifications are approved and in plain language, and that terminations are joint decisions.</p>
<p><strong>*Disclaimer:</strong> The thoughts presented in this article are only a sampling of the options available to licensees regarding the creation or termination of a contract and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The author is not providing a legal opinion as to the rights and obligations of a licensee under a contract. A licensee should consult with his/her attorney regarding the options and actions they should take relating to the creation, modification, or termination of a contract.

    <description><![CDATA[The new ownership intends to rebrand the 74-acre property into an outdoor lifestyle center as well as “unlock the full development potential of the site.”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>YONKERS—The Ridge Hill Shopping Center in Yonkers, which first opened more than a decade ago, has been sold to a partnership of Nuveen Real Estate, Taconic Partners and North American Properties for $220 million. The new ownership intends to rebrand the 74-acre property into an outdoor lifestyle center as well as “unlock the full development potential of the site.”</p>
<p>The property was sold by QIC Real Estate, which acquired interest in the 1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use complex off the New York State Thruway in 2016 and 2017 from Forests City Realty Trust. The 2017 transaction included the remaining Forest City Realty ownership of Ridge Hill, as part of 10-property portfolio deal on behalf of a QIC client.</p>
<p>The sale of the Ridge Hill Shopping Center does not include the Monarch at Ridge Hill condominium development. Forest City developed Ridge Hill shopping center for approximately $600 million.</p>
<p>The new ownership states that its renovation/repositioning plans for the Ridge Hill complex are still in development, but the partners will “look to incorporate state-of-the-art initiatives that enhance Ridge Hill&#8217;s public spaces, street design and parking amenities. They will also draw on their combined network of retailers to attract top-tier local and NYC inspired food and beverage concepts, and national luxury apparel and boutique fitness providers, building on Ridge Hill&#8217;s existing experiential features to create the leading lifestyle center in the tri-state region.”</p>
<p>JLL marketed the property on behalf of the seller—QIC US Management, Inc. Additionally, working on behalf of the new ownership, JLL secured a $181.3-million non-recourse acquisition loan from Heitman Capital Management LLC.</p>
<p>“We see this as an attractively priced asset in an evolving sector that fits within our well-diversified New York property focused real estate fund,” said Nadir Settles, Managing Director at Nuveen and Head of the New York Property Fund. “The acquisition of Ridge Hill reflects a generational opportunity to re-position an already dominant lifestyle center that sits in the heart of one of the country&#8217;s most affluent and densely populated regions.”</p>
<p>“This unique retail asset will be a great addition to our fund and we look forward to being a part of its successful redevelopment,” said Chris Balestra, President and Chief Investment Officer at Taconic Partners.</p>
<p>Ridge Hill is currently 71.7% occupied and home to a mix of retail and office tenants, including Whole Foods, Lowe’s, Dick’s Sporting Goods, T.J.Maxx, H&amp;M, LA Fitness, LL Bean, Showcase Cinemas, Legoland Discovery Center, Guitar Center, the Container Store and Westmed Medical Group. The property welcomes 7.1 million annual visitors and is in the top 1% of the most trafficked centers in the U.S. and New York.</p>
<p>A QIC spokesman stated, “We can confirm QIC&#8217;s successful divestment of Ridge Hill, which is in line with our investor-endorsed strategy. QIC has interests in a number of real estate and infrastructure assets across the U.S. on behalf of investors. As an active investment manager, the number of assets we manage on behalf of our institutional clients evolves in alignment with our client-endorsed investment strategies. The U.S. remains a key investment location for QIC.”</p>
<p>North American Properties stated that it will begin operations and repositioning of the property this month. NAP is a boutique, full-service real estate owner/developer notable for projects such as Avalon in Alpharetta, GA; Birkdale Village in Charlotte, NC; Colony Square in Atlanta, GA and, Newport on the Levee in Newport, KY. The partnership between Nuveen and NAP continues to grow, with Ridge Hill representing their third project together. The partners recently acquired the open-air lifestyle center The Forum on Peachtree Parkway in Peachtree Corners, GA.</p>
<p>“Over the last decade, Ridge Hill has become a core component of the Yonkers community and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to enhance it by applying our high-touch, hospitality-driven approach toward management,” said Tim Perry, Managing Partner at NAP. He later added, “We&#8217;ve already started working to enhance the public realm, bring technology forward in the guest and parking experience, as well as longer term unlocking the full development potential of the site. Helping to design and define this will require community engagement to determine what&#8217;s missing, from a retail, as well as experiential, perspective.”</p>
<p>Nuveen Real Estate and Taconic Partners have collaborated since 2015, collectively investing more than $2 billion across more than 2 million square feet in New York. The partners completed a $260-million fundraising round for their jointly sponsored value-add New York City Property Fund II in 2021. The acquisition of Ridge Hill is the partnership&#8217;s first investment into value-add retail and an opportunity to diversify beyond its existing life science, office and industrial holdings, the partnership stated.</p>
<p>The JLL Retail Capital Markets team that represented the seller was led by Senior Managing Director Dave Monahan, Senior Director Cameron Pittman, Senior Managing Director and Co-Head of U.S. Retail Capital Markets Chris Angelone and Senior Managing Directors Jose Cruz and Andrew Scandalios.</p>
<p>“Ridge Hill is one of the more compelling investment opportunities that I have transacted on in my career,” Monahan said. “Driven by the exceptional trade area characteristics, highly desirable existing tenancy and multiple value creation opportunities, this asset received a tremendous amount of interest from a broad range of investors. The collective experience and operational expertise of the buyer group of Nuveen, Taconic and North American Properties creates an ownership that is uniquely qualified to enable Ridge Hill to achieve its highest potential.”</p>
<p>The JLL Capital Markets Debt Advisory team that represented the borrower included Senior Managing Directors Kellogg Gaines, Aaron Niedermayer and Evan Pariser, Managing Director Claudia Steeb and Analyst Joy Dracos.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>KATONAH—Sequestered on 80 acres in the Katonah countryside in northern Westchester County, Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts is an unassuming, yet incredibly beautiful destination for live music performances of all genres. Featuring a Spanish courtyard, Venetian theater, sunken gardens, a Renaissance-infused music room and meandering pathways to explore, Caramoor also offers educational and mentoring programs for young musicians.</p>
<p>Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this not-for-profit organization has been captivating audiences with live instrumentals and vocals for decades, and this month, opens its 77th summer season.</p>
<div id="attachment_40761" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40761" class="wp-image-40761" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Venetian-Theater.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-40761" class="wp-caption-text">The Venetian Theater at Caramoor</p></div>
<p>In fact, world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma will kick off the venue’s 2022 summer season on Saturday, June 18 with The Knights in the Venetian theater. Caramoor President Ed Lewis said this year’s programming will reflect one of the most diverse selections of musical presentations ever. “Our goal is to make Caramoor accessible to a larger community and offer a broader representation of artists with a vast array of backgrounds and cultures,” he said. “In fact, I think that people will actually be able to see themselves in the new cover of our 2022 Summer Season catalog.”</p>
<p>Moving beyond the typical “Bach and Beethoven type of performances,” Caramoor’s summer season includes a Juneteenth celebration with internationally-acclaimed recording artist Jeremiah Abiah, the Las Cafeteras Afro-Mexican band, an American Roots festival, a Night at the Opera, a Jazz Festival and Soundscapes dance and sound artists.</p>
<p>Also coming this summer are “Talkbacks” with Helga Davis of WNYC Radio, featuring conversations with musical artists following their performances, as well as “Music and Meditation” in the Sunken Garden on select Saturday mornings. Caramoor’s popular “Afternoon Teas” will also return on either Fridays or Sundays, along with tours of the Rosen House.</p>
<p>This legendary enclave traces its history to 1929 when it was built by Walter and Lucie Bigelow Rosen, as a private retreat for music and the arts. Born in Berlin, Germany, in 1875, Walter Rosen was a successful attorney and banker who was devoted to the arts. His wife, Lucie Bigelow Rosen, born in New York City, enjoyed fashion, dance, visual arts and music. The couple met in 1914 and were married just six weeks later.</p>
<p>The Rosens had one son, Walter Bigelow Rosen and one daughter, Ann Rosen-Stern, who served for many years on the Board of Trustees at Caramoor. It was Walter Rosen’s friend, Charles Hoyt, who first introduced the Rosens to the property. Hoyt’s mother, Caroline Moore Hoyt, sold them her Katonah estate, which was named for her, “Caramoor.” From 1929 to 1939, Rosen designed and built the stucco villa now known as the Rosen House.</p>
<div id="attachment_40758" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40758" class="wp-image-40758" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Caramoor_Ed-Lewis.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-40758" class="wp-caption-text">Ed Lewis, President &amp; CEO , Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts</p></div>
<p>In 1945, the Rosens bequeathed the Caramoor estate as a center for music and art in memory of their son, who had died the previous year. In the 1950s, the Spanish Courtyard became the setting for outdoor concerts and in 1958, they opened the Venetian Theater. The historic Rosen House opened to the public in 1971.</p>
<p>“Caramoor has everything I love— nature, music and historic buildings. It’s a place where history, music and the arts converge,” said Lewis, who now admits he hadn’t heard of the venue prior to being appointed president. While serving as Vice Chancellor for Advancement at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, he received an e-mail from an executive search firm about the opening at Caramoor. “When I saw it, I couldn’t resist,” he admitted. “In addition to the rich history, music and arts, it’s also a place of beauty to relax and walk the gardens.” Lewis joined Caramoor as President and CEO in May, 2021.</p>
<p>His extensive career in the arts included a prior position as Senior Director of Development at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center at the University of Maryland, College Park. Lewis is also a professional musician. As a violist, he has performed with the Dallas Opera Orchestra, the Dallas Chamber Orchestra, Santa Fe Pro Muscia, the Toledo Symphony, Spoleto Festival Orchestra and Aspen Chamber Symphony.</p>
<p>He holds a Bachelor of Music degree from Northwestern University and a Master of Music degree from the University of Michigan. Lewis also completed his Doctoral Program post-graduate studies at the University of Maryland School of Music.</p>
<p>One of his goals is continuing to leverage Caramoor’s outdoor spaces for more community day events, and to increase its membership beyond the current 900 people. “Most members are from northern Westchester, Putnam and Fairfield counites, but we are starting to attract more form New York City,” he noted. “It’s such a special place that offers unique settings.”</p>
<div id="attachment_40760" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40760" class="wp-image-40760" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Music-Room.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="250" /><p id="caption-attachment-40760" class="wp-caption-text">The Music Room at Caramoor</p></div>
<p>The Venetian Theater holds close to 1,500 people and is also available to rent for private events. The Sunken Garden, renovated in 2019, is often rented out for weddings or private events and can seat up to 300. The Spanish Courtyard, with a 500-seat capacity, is another favorite spot for private events.</p>
<p>Caramoor’s funding is currently about 60% from corporate and private donations, 20% from institutional grants and the remainder from event ticket sales. Its staff of 30 employees swells to more than 80 in the summer.</p>
<p>“We also work with Westchester County Tourism &amp; Film to promote our events,” added Lewis. Information on upcoming shows and ticket sales are available through its website at <a href="http://www.caramoor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.caramoor.org</a>.</p>
<p>The summer season finale will feature the Orchestra of St. Luke’s in the Venetian Theater on August 7. However, Caramoor will continue to offer a few smaller concerts on the lawn through August 19.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>ALBANY—A contingent of more than 70 members of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and staff traveled to Albany on May 10 to lobby state lawmakers on the organization’s 2022 legislative agenda that includes staunch opposition to “Good Cause” eviction and the association’s support for statewide co-op transparency legislation, similar to laws passed in Rockland and Westchester counties recently.</p>
<p>The HGAR delegation was led by Legislative Co-Chair Leah Caro and HGAR President Anthony Domathoti. HGAR Chief Executive Officer Richard Haggerty noted that the program, part of the New York State Association of Realtors Annual Lobby Day, had the most association participants in memory. In addition, HGAR’s session with lawmakers at the State Capital lasted close to two hours and was attended by the most state Assembly members and State Senators in the history of the association’s annual Lobby Day programs.</p>
<p>The HGAR delegation featured members from throughout the association’s market area of Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Sullivan, the Bronx and Manhattan.</p>
<p>The 2022 HGAR Advocacy Agenda included its support for expanded access to homeowners, including enacting a first-time homebuyer’s savings account; support for affordable workforce housing development through tax incentives and smart zoning policies; enactment of direct state funding for universal broadband Internet access and expanding state level student loan debt forgiveness. HGAR also voiced its support for a host of Fair Housing Law enhancement bills and measures that would reduce state and local real estate taxes.</p>
<p>HGAR met with lawmakers from Bronx and Manhattan as well as from its Hudson Valley market area. Those lawmakers from the Bronx that attended the session at Hearing Room A at the State Legislative Office Building included: Bronx Senators Luis R. Sepulveda, 32nd Dist., and Jamaal T. Bailey, 36th Dist. Bronx Assembly Members who participated in the discussion were Nathalia Fernandez, 80th Dist., Jeffrey Dinowitz, 81st Dist.; Michael Benedetto, 82nd Dist., and Kenny Burgos, 85th Dist. HGAR representatives met outside of the hearing room with Bronx Assembly Members Latoya Joyner, 77th Dist., Jose Rivera, 78th Dist., Yudelka Tapia, 86th Dist. In addition, NYSAR and HGAR’s leadership team met with Paul Upton, Deputy Chief of Staff for Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, 83rd Dist.</p>
<p>HGAR representatives met with Manhattan Assembly member Manny De Los Santos, 72nd Dist. on Lobby Day and Manhattan Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright, 76th Dist. sent a representative to the Lobby Day session at Hearing Room A. HGAR officials noted that a meeting is expected to be held with Manhattan Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, 26th Dist. in the near future.</p>
<p>State Senators from the Westchester-Hudson Valley delegation who participated in the Lobby Day session with HGAR included: Shelley Mayer, 37th District; James Skoufis, 39th District; Elijah Reichlin-Melnick, 38th District; Jamaal Bailey (36th District, which includes part of Westchester and the Bronx) and Sue Serino, 41st District. Assembly Members from the Westchester-Hudson Valley region who participated were Amy Paulin, 88th District; Steve Otis, 91st District; Tom Abinanti, 92nd District and Mike Lawler, 97th District.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Communications Director for Assembly Member Nader Sayegh, 90th District, Kerry Donovan, also attended the Lobby Day session and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, 35th District, met with a delegation from HGAR on Lobby Day.</p>
<p>A host of state lawmakers noted the drawbacks to Good Cause Eviction, but said they need to protect the interests of tenants who have been hit hard by the COVID pandemic from landlords that are in some cases large national real estate investment firms.</p>
<p>HGAR CEO Haggerty, who noted that there is a need for a balanced approach to the issue, responded, “That is one segment. We also have a lot of ‘mom and pop,” small landlords who have invested in real estate as a way of building wealth, a means of building generational wealth. So, the challenge is finding that middle ground that benefits both landlords and tenants in a fair way and I think that is what we all have to strive for.”</p>
<p>Besides Good Cause eviction legislation, HGAR also voiced its opposition to a bill that would seek to strip real estate professionals from their hard-fought independent contractor status and a bill that would establish a statewide rental control scheme on nearly all private properties in the state. State Assemblymember Amy Paulin told HGAR members that she said the “flawed” Good Cause eviction legislation does not have sufficient support to pass the State Legislature.</p>
<p>HGAR’s Caro informed lawmakers about the co-op transparency legislation passed in Westchester and Rockland counties and termed the state’s current lack of transparency over cooperative transactions as “the last bastion of institutionalized discrimination.”</p>
<p>HGAR’s Barry Kramer said that cooperatives are the popular affordable housing component in the region and providing transparency to the purchasing process will ensure that Fair Housing practices are being followed so that all segments of the population have access to this key market.</p>
<p>State Sen. Mayer, who has been a long-standing proponent of co-op transparency in Westchester as well as in New York State, said, “All of my communities are struggling to find affordable housing—every one of them. Your (HGAR) leadership on this issue is going to be extremely instrumental.”</p>
<p>She noted that families that earn $50,000 a year or less or work two jobs in Westchester find it very difficult to find rental housing in Westchester and more needs to be done on this critical issue.</p>
<p>“Thank you for being great partners, great advocates for our communities and have such high standards for professionalism that really many other professions should emulate,” Sen. Mayer said.</p>
<p>Assembly Member Steve Otis added that the Hudson Valley had an affordable housing crisis prior to the pandemic, that has only been exacerbated since then by the virus as well as rising inflation. Rep. Otis noted that the state must office more tools to provide residents with more access to affordable housing.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over the years there have been a multitude of lawsuits filed involving whether a valid contract was entered into between purchasers and sellers of real property. Recently, in <em>Cohen v. Holder</em>, the Appellate Division, Second Department, issued an opinion dealing with this issue once again. The Statute of Frauds is a common law concept that has been codified which requires written contracts for certain agreements to be binding. In New York, all contracts involving the sale of real property and leases for more than one year in length must be in writing. This article will review the decision in <em>Cohen v. Holder,</em> and review the specific statute of frauds requirements under New York’s General Obligations Law.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Frauds Under N.Y. GOL § 5-701</strong></p>
<p>Generally, Section 5-701 subsection a. of the N.Y. GOL [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3ypV7bq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ypV7bq</a>], in part, provides that “every agreement, promise or undertaking is void, unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith, or by his lawful agent, if such agreement, promise or undertaking: 1. By its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof or the performance of which is not to be completed before the end of a lifetime.”… Therefore, any agreement the term of which is longer than one year in term must be in writing. However, notwithstanding the provisions of § 5-701, contracts involving the sale or transfer of real property contracts are always required to be in writing under § 5-703 regardless of the length of its term.</p>
<p>It is important to note that under New York law an agreement for the payment of a commission to a real estate broker does not need to be in writing. Under Section 5-701 subsection a., a written agreement is required where there:</p>
<p>“10. Is a contract to pay compensation for services rendered in negotiating a loan, or in negotiating the purchase, sale, exchange, renting or leasing of any real estate or interest therein, or of a business opportunity, business, its good will, inventory, fixtures or an interest therein, including a majority of the voting stock interest in a corporation and including the creating of a partnership interest. ‘Negotiating’ includes procuring an introduction to a party to the transaction or assisting in the negotiation or consummation of the transaction.”</p>
<p>While subsection 5-701[a][10] provides that “it shall apply to a contract implied in fact or in law to pay reasonable compensation…”, it does “not apply to a contract to pay compensation [to] a duly licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman.” Therefore, while it is always recommended that a written agreement be entered into by and between a seller and broker, so that the terms of the engagement and arrangement are clearly spelled out, a broker may be entitled to “reasonable compensation” even where no written agreement exists, if the broker introduces a ready, willing, and able purchaser to a seller, and there is a meeting of the minds.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate Contracts &amp; Leases Longer </strong><strong>Than One Year Must in be Writing </strong><strong>Under N.Y. GOL § 5-703</strong></p>
<p>Under N.Y. GOL § 5-703[2] [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3kZeUqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3kZeUqo</a>] “[a] contract for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale, of any real property, or an interest therein, is void unless the contract or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consideration, is in writing, subscribed by the party to be charged, or by his lawful agent thereunto authorized by writing.” The provision above seems to be simple and straightforward, however, therein lies the problem. While it is clear that a real estate contract or a lease for more than one year be in writing, and that there be consideration reflected in the agreement, the courts have had to interpret this provision and provide additional requirements under the common law relating to contracts to establish whether a valid agreement exists between the parties.</p>
<p><strong>Required Contract Terms: <em>Cohen v. Holder</em></strong></p>
<p>In <em>Cohen v. Holder</em> [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3ytQxcj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3ytQxcj</a>], the purchaser and the seller executed a document which was “purported” to be an “agreement for the sale of a four-family brownstone located in Brooklyn…for the purchase price of $300,000.” The court points out that this document did not provide for “the date or place of the closing.” Approximately 17 months after executing this document, the purchaser’s attorney sent a letter to the seller’s attorney declaring “time of the essence.” The closing never occurred, and the purchaser sued the seller for specific performance.</p>
<p>The court explained that “under the statute of frauds, a contract for the sale of real property must be evidenced by a writing (see N.Y. GOL § 5-703[1]).” The court further provided that the “writing must ‘identify the parties, describe the subject matter, be signed by the party to be charged, and state all of the essential terms of an agreement’. In a real estate transaction, the essential terms of a contract typically include the purchase price, the time and terms of payment, the required financing, the closing date, the quality of title to be conveyed, the risk of loss during the sale period, and adjustments for taxes and utilities.” It is clear from this court’s decision that simply having a document that is executed by both parties is not enough to establish that there is a valid and binding contract of sale between the parties.</p>
<p>The court in <em>Cohen</em> further provided that “the writing must set forth the entire contract with reasonable certainty so that the substance thereof appears from the writing alone…. If the contract is incomplete and it is necessary to resort to parol evidence to ascertain what was agreed to, the remedy of specific performance is not available.&#8221; Courts are reluctant to add terms to any contract unless they are clearly negotiated and included in the document. Therefore, the purchaser would not be entitled to the remedy of specific performance whereby the seller would be forced to consummate the sale and transfer.</p>
<p>The court in Cohen also pointed out that “In addition to the document not specifying the closing date, the evidence established that the parties never agreed with respect to the mortgage terms.” The purported agreement did not include any financing provisions and although the purchaser “testified that he was purchasing the property ‘subject’ to the existing mortgage and that he had the ‘option’ of obtaining a purchase money mortgage,” none of these terms were actually included in the document. Therefore, the court held that “The failure to include such terms makes the purported real estate contract unenforceable.” Therefore, it is important to ensure that all relevant provisions are included in any real estate contract or there may be a possibility that the agreement will be deemed null and void.</p>
<p><strong>Residential Leases and N.Y. GOL § 5-702</strong></p>
<p>Under N.Y. GOL § 5-702 [a] [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3P9UgBF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3P9UgBF</a>] “every written agreement…for the lease of space to be occupied for residential purposes, for the lease of personal property to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes…must be: 1. Written in a clear and coherent manner using words with common and everyday meanings; and 2. Appropriately divided and captioned by its various sections.” Landlords, attorneys, and brokers must be aware of this requirement and be sure to utilize leases that adhere to both requirements.</p>
<p>If a seller, creditor, or lessor fails to adhere to the requirements of N.Y. GOL § 5-702, the said party “shall be liable to a consumer…in an amount equal to any actual damages sustained plus a penalty of fifty dollars. The total class action penalty against any such creditor, seller or lessor shall not exceed ten thousand dollars in any class action or series of class actions arising out of the use by a creditor, seller or lessor of an agreement which fails to comply with this subdivision.” It is important to note that a violation of this provision does not “render any such agreement void or voidable.” In addition, no action may be brought by a consumer or lessee “after both parties to the agreement have fully performed their obligation under such agreement, nor shall any creditor, seller or lessor who attempts in good faith to comply with this subdivision be liable for such penalties.”</p>
<p><strong>Agreements in Writing: Best Practice</strong></p>
<p>Whether the law requires an agreement to be in writing or not, it is always a good idea to have a formal agreement prepared for any transaction that is being contemplated. Often times, courts may void an agreement if all of the “essential” terms are not included. Therefore, it is important to have an attorney, knowledgeable in this area, to prepare any agreement, particularly residential (as well as commercial) lease agreements, due to the everchanging legal landscape and legal requirements. Many landlords elect to not use an attorney and this could lead to violations of law and the loss of important rights and remedies. Parties may believe that their rights will be protected since they have entered into and executed an “agreement,” but little do they know that the “purported” agreement may not be worth the paper it is written on.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>YONKERS—Westchester County and city officials were on hand on May 5 to celebrate the groundbreaking of a nearly $600-million mixed-use project that will transform a large swath of the city’s waterfront by adding nearly 1,400 units of housing to its growing housing stock.</p>
<p>Extell Development officials turned the first dirt on its long awaited $585-million Hudson Piers development that will feature 1,395 residential units, including approximately 140 affordable housing units. The project is being built on a now vacant 17.4-acre parcel that formerly housed a plastics factory.</p>
<p>City officials say that Hudson Piers will be the largest private development to be undertaken in city history and represents the largest project to receive incentives from the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency.</p>
<p>The project will be developed in three phases over a six-year period and is expected to create 200 permanent jobs and 450-500 construction jobs. The first phase will involve the construction of the first two buildings of what will be, when completed six, seven-story buildings totaling 870,000 square feet of space. The project will also include 37,000 rentable square feet of ground floor retail space and an expansive riverfront esplanade.</p>
<p>Extell worked closely with the City of Yonkers and the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency to provide the Hudson Piers project with a 20-year PILOT and a 100% abatement on taxes for improvements.</p>
<div id="attachment_40930" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40930" class="wp-image-40930" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20171218-rendering-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="260" /><p id="caption-attachment-40930" class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of the Hudson Piers development to be built by Extell Development Co. of New York City.</p></div>
<p>Back on Aug. 29, 2018, the Yonkers IDA approved financial incentives that included $15,382,926 in sales and use tax exemptions and $5,875,732 in mortgage recording tax exemptions. Extell’s 20-year payment in lieu of taxes agreement (PILOT) consists of an annual payment of $4,519,000.</p>
<p>“Extell’s Hudson Piers will be one of the most transformative developments this city has seen,” said Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano. “It will cap off the extraordinary momentum seen in recent years that’s spurred unprecedented investment in our city. I look forward to welcoming more families, businesses and jobs to Yonkers on the river and fulfilling our truest potential.”</p>
<p>He said Extell’s Hudson Piers caps what has been a total of nearly $5 billion in private investment development funding in the City of Yonkers in recent years. Mayor Spano termed it a “crowning achievement” for the city’s four-and-a-half mile Hudson River shoreline.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be a part of the incredible redevelopment which has turned Yonkers into the fastest growing big city in New York State under Mayor Mike Spano,” said Gary Barnett, Founder &amp; Chairman of Extell Development Company. “Hudson Piers will introduce a significant supply of new luxury and affordable housing to Yonkers and will bring the Extell quality of construction complemented by an unmatched array of lifestyle amenities to the City’s waterfront.”</p>
<p>Barnett noted that his firm went into contract on the purchase of the waterfront parcel more than five years ago. When asked if the current supply chain issues, higher labor and material costs will affect the project’s timeline, Barnett responded, “It won’t, but it is more painful because everything costs more and we did not necessarily plan on it. So, hopefully it is going to be a commercial success, but it’s not going to affect the timeline. We are moving ahead and the first two buildings are under construction and we plan to continue from there.”</p>
<p>Deputy County Executive Ken Jenkins, a Yonkers native, said, “I am so super excited to see this kind of transformative project here in Yonkers.” He said the project will help connect the city’s existing Riverwalk beginning at the Sugar House site and eventually run all the way to Hastings. Jenkins noted that the Riverwalk will eventually run from the Bronx line to the border with Putnam County.</p>
<p>Construction on the first two buildings should be completed within 18 to 24 months. Barnett said full build-out of Hudson Piers should take between five to six years. The construction manager for Hudson Piers is Platinum Developers of Lakewood, NJ. The architect is Perkins Eastman.</p>
<p>Hudson Piers will offer a mix of studio- to-three-bedroom residences. Interiors will feature fully tiled bathrooms, in-unit washer/dryers, premium stainless-steel appliances, Kohler fixtures, separate zones for heating and cooling, and private terraces, company officials stated.</p>
<div id="attachment_40931" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40931" class="wp-image-40931" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20171218-rendering-3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="260" /><p id="caption-attachment-40931" class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of the Hudson Piers development to be built by Extell Development Co. of New York City.</p></div>
<p>Planned outdoor amenities include waterfront recreation terraces with hammocks, fire pits, grilling stations, sundecks, billiards, putting greens, bocce courts, an outdoor swimming pool, and fresh retail. Indoor amenities will include multiple fitness centers, lounges, playrooms, a catering kitchen, basketball gym, screening room, game room, teen rooms, business and conference center and a 24-hour attended lobby. A total of 1,028 covered parking spaces will be provided on the first two floors of the buildings, with an additional 212 on-grade spaces, for a total of 1,240 parking spaces. Each of the buildings will have their own package, storage and bicycle rooms. Shuttle services will be provided for residents to and from the Yonkers Metro-North train station.</p>
<p>As part of the Hudson Piers project, 1.5 acres of new public parkland will be created as well as a 1.5-mile-long esplanade extension that will adjoin to the existing public waterfront promenade. Plans also call for the construction of a new elevated roadway to be named Riverside Drive, which will be deeded back to the city.</p>
<p>Extell Development, which was founded in 1989, has extensive holdings in New York City. Among its current projects include Central Park Tower, the tallest residential tower in the world located on “Billionaire’s Row;” the largest condominium in Lower Manhattan, One Manhattan Square located on the edge of the New York Harbor; Brooklyn Point, a a residential tower in Downtown Brooklyn; The Kent at 200 East 95th St., an Art Deco inspired building; 1010 Park, a collection of 11 full-floor and duplex luxury condominiums; and 70 Charlton, the first luxury residential development in Hudson Square in West SoHo. Extell has also restored and updated a number of classic properties in landmark neighborhoods, including the former Stanhope Hotel at 995 Fifth Avenue and The Belnord, a landmark building on the Upper West Side.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[President Biden released the plan on May 16. Administration officials termed the Housing Supply Action Plan as “the most comprehensive all of government effort to close the housing supply shortfall in history.”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—The initial reaction from the real estate industry to President Biden’s Housing Supply Action Plan that looks through a variety of measures to increase the affordable housing stock in the United States by preserving and building hundreds of thousands of units and closing the housing supply gap in the country within the next five years was generally favorable.</p>
<p>President Biden released the plan on May 16. Administration officials termed the Housing Supply Action Plan as “the most comprehensive of all government effort to close the housing supply shortfall in history.”</p>
<p>The plan comes after President Biden&#8217;s $1.75-trillion Build Back Better plan stalled in Congress back in December. Build Back Better called for $150 billion in funding for the construction and rehabilitation of more than 1 million affordable rental and single-family homes. No cost estimates were released on the Housing Supply Action Plan.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the administration will:</p>
<p>• Reward jurisdictions that have reformed zoning and land-use policies with higher scores in certain federal grant processes, for the first time at scale.</p>
<p>• Deploy new financing mechanisms to build and preserve more housing where financing gaps currently exist: manufactured housing (including with chattel loans that the majority of manufactured housing purchasers rely on), accessory dwelling units (ADUs), 2-4 unit properties, and smaller multifamily buildings.</p>
<p>• Expand and improve existing forms of federal financing, including affordable multifamily development and preservation. This includes making Construction to Permanent loans (where one loan finances the construction but is also a long-term mortgage) more widely available by exploring the feasibility of Fannie Mae purchase of these loans; promoting the use of state, local, and Tribal government COVID-19 recovery funds to expand affordable housing supply; and announcing reforms to the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which provides credits to private investors developing affordable rental housing, and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), which provides grants to states and localities that communities use to fund a wide range of housing activities.</p>
<p>• Ensure that more government-owned supply of homes and other housing goes to owners who will live in them—or non-profits who will rehab them—not large institutional investors.</p>
<p>• Work with the private sector to address supply chain challenges and improve building techniques to finish construction in 2022 on the most new homes in any year since 2006.</p>
<p>Some of the funding highlights from the administration’s announcement include: The Unlocking Possibilities Program, proposed by President Biden and included in the reconciliation bill passed by the House last year, would establish a new, $1.75-billion competitive grant program, administered by HUD, to help states and localities eliminate needless barriers to affordable housing production, including permitting for manufactured housing communities.</p>
<p>Building on the Unlocking Possibilities Program, the President’s 2023 Budget includes a mandatory spending proposal that would provide $10 billion in HUD Grants to Reduce Affordable Housing Barriers for states and localities that have already adopted Housing Forward policies and practices to address challenges to housing supply production constraints. While Unlocking Possibilities would help states and localities undertake reform, the Housing Supply Fund would reward those that have already made reforms by giving them additional funding to boost the affordability and maximize the benefits of their new policies. This funding would also support broader housing development activities, including environmental planning and mitigation, road infrastructure, and water or sewer infrastructure, the administration stated.</p>
<p>In addition, the plan calls for the financing for the development of 500,000 units of housing for low- and moderate-income renters and homebuyers. The President’s 2023 Budget includes a proposal for $25 billion for grants for affordable housing production. These resources would be distributed to state and local housing finance agencies and their partners, territories, and tribes, and would be focused on streamlining financing tools to reduce transaction costs and increase housing supply through multifamily and single-family housing units of modest density (up to 100 units per site). HUD will encourage grantees to develop housing that directly meet identified local needs, especially housing that is not sufficiently provided by the market. This includes intergenerational housing, investments that place vacant or underutilized properties back into productive use, ADUs, and novel and non-traditional development techniques, including modular, panelized, or manufactured housing. States and localities would have flexibility to design their programs to meet local needs, and the resources would be used to support renters and homebuyers with up to 150% of area median income in high-cost areas.</p>
<p>A host of real estate and finance organizations came out in support of the plan. Mortgage Bankers Association&#8217;s President and CEO Bob Broeksmit, CMB, stated, “MBA commends the Biden administration for announcing steps to alleviate the acute shortage of single-family and multifamily housing for prospective homebuyers and renters. Eliminating the regulatory barriers to new construction, including manufactured housing, in underserved markets; expanding affordable financing for multifamily development and rehab projects; and a commitment to more private and public sector partnerships will help address the housing supply and affordability challenges that continue to burden families.”</p>
<p>Broeksmit added that the MBA strongly encourages HUD to focus on the issues that continue to lead to significant lending pipeline delays in its MAP program, which is a primary financing option for producing more affordable rental housing.</p>
<p>Jerry Konter, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said, “The plan contains many positive elements that would help address a host of affordability challenges and improve financing options, and acknowledges the long-term headwinds, like supply chain bottlenecks and chronic construction labor shortages, repeatedly identified by NAHB members as holding back housing production. We agree with the White House that the key to resolving our nation’s housing affordability challenges is to build more homes. NAHB looks forward to working with the Biden administration and Congress to provide a comprehensive long-term solution to the affordability crisis that will enable builders to construct more affordable entry-level housing, raise minority homeownership rates, and shore up the national economy.”</p>
<p>The National Apartment Association and the National Multifamily Housing Council also applauded the Biden administration for recognizing the nation’s critical shortage of affordable housing and developing a comprehensive package of regulatory and legislative measures to help address it.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the two organizations stated: “The administration’s thoughtful proposal rightly acknowledges that there is no single magic bullet that can solve our housing shortage. It is the result of decades of policy failures to address a growing shortage of housing production that has resulted in today’s crisis. In fact, research conducted by Hoyt Advisory Services has found that through 2030, the U.S. will need to build an average of 328,000 apartments every year. That mark has only been achieved five times since 1989. This crisis predates the pandemic and therefore it is critical that local, state and federal governments, along with the private sector, do all they can to reduce regulatory burdens and encourage the development and rehabilitation of housing of all types and price points.”</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>More than four years ago, Bridget Gibbons left the private sector to join the Latimer Administration’s economic development department. Little did she know that two years into her new job, the county would be facing its biggest health crisis—COVID-19 that required her to work on developing programs and initiatives to help businesses cope with the pandemic.</p>
<p>First as Deputy Director of Economic Development for Westchester County and beginning with her appointment by Westchester County Executive George Latimer in the fall of 2018 as Director of the Office of Economic Development, Gibbons has spearheaded efforts to provide resources and funding to impacted small businesses. She has also been in charge of the county’s day-to-day operations of the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency and its Local Development Corp.</p>
<p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> recently chatted with Gibbons to learn what the county believes are its growth sectors, what it is doing to help companies fill jobs and what major projects are on the horizon in the coming years?</p>
<p>Before joining county government, Gibbons was founder and owner of Gibbons Digital Consultants, a digital marketing agency. The company helped a wide variety of industries in the tri-state area leverage social media as a business development tool, providing a full-range of services from comprehensive, long-term strategy to daily social media management on Facebook and all other platforms.</p>
<p>Her company was recognized by the Advertising Club of Westchester, winning awards for its work with Facebook and e-mail management. In 2014, Gibbons was recognized for her leadership and management skills, and <em>914 Inc</em>. magazine named her one of Westchester County’s “Best Bosses.” After nine years, her company was acquired by a larger marketing agency in White Plains.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-40971" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/55576549_10156936182721636_195747695770468352_o-820x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" />Before launching her digital business, Gibbons spent 15 years as a senior consultant and project manager for Towers Watson, a global human resources and benefits consulting firm, where she managed large, multi-national project teams to implement complex, web-based systems. Her clients included JPMorgan Chase, IBM, Molson Coors and Accenture. She holds a Bachelor’s Degree in International Studies from American University in Washington DC, and certificates in computer technology from Columbia University and in Social Media from New York University.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The Office of Economic Development finalized a new strategic plan in 2020 but its implementation was impacted by the coronavirus in 2021. Can you briefly describe the key facets of the strategic plan and the status of its implementation?</p>
<p><strong>Gibbons:</strong> The plan really outlined a sector strategy for the county to have us align our human resources and financial resources to grow four key sectors: biosciences, advanced manufacturing, clean energy and technology. The reason for those sectors is they align very well with our highly-educated workforce. They are resilient and those sectors were not as negatively impacted (from prior economic downturns) as many other sectors like hospitality and others. They are the future. They all have well-paying jobs and growth is expected for all those sectors.</p>
<p>So, in the beginning of 2021 we had to focus on helping our businesses recover (from the COVID-19 pandemic) and we gave out grants to our small businesses to help them recover some of the increased costs and decreases in revenues. At the same time, we did start to build out in these (four growth) sectors in our sector growth strategy. We established a task force in the biosciences that consists of the key stakeholders across the county, start-ups, larger businesses, key business organizations like the Business Council of Westchester and the Westchester County Association. We got the key stakeholders in the biosciences industry to meet on a monthly basis to really understand what the issues are.</p>
<p>The focus of the task force is to determine  how we grow the sector. And so, over the course of 2021, we really spent some time uncovering those barriers to growth and we are now in 2022 starting to move and make changes and have projects related to overcoming those barriers. For example, we know that real estate is an issue in Westchester County for bioscience start-ups. The biosciences sector is unique in that they do not have a lot of employees when they are starting-up. So, they have scientists and researchers working for a number of years on a therapeutic, a drug or medical device. So, it takes a long time and therefore they don’t fit into the normal model of businesses that grow at 10 to 15 employees in a given year when they are doing well. So, we have to have the ability to nurture these companies so they stay here in Westchester and don’t go elsewhere. We know there is a need for start-up space and they also have requirements for a laboratory for the most part. So, having lab space for our start-ups that is affordable for the emerging businesses in the biosciences is something we don’t have enough of. We are working with a consultant right now to identify how the county can play a role in fixing this problem. We know New York City 10 years ago got actively involved in using incentives to encourage developers to build more lab space. So, we are looking at all of the options to determine what is the best role for the county to play in that. Real estate is an issue. Incentives are an issue. We know that parts of the metro region, including Connecticut and New Jersey, have incentive programs that really attract and retain these start-ups in the biosciences industry. … The (biosciences) task force identified issues in 2021 and 2022 and we are examining the best solution from a county perspective as to what is the best role to play there.</p>
<p>We also established an Advanced Manufacturing Task Force and that group has been meeting on a monthly basis since the beginning of 2021. This task force also consists of business owners and key business organizations, including Westchester Community College, the WCA and BCW, to find out what the growth issues are for that sector. The big issue that existed prior to the pandemic and the ‘Big Resignation’ was their ability to hire. It is a real challenge for them and we did a quick review of resources to help them hire people and we identified the need for a certificate program to train entry-level workers. These people don’t have to have manufacturing experience, but we would like to have them have some skills so they are an asset immediately to the business owner. So, we established our first class, a certificate program—the Certified Production Technician 4.0—which is a nationally recognized credential. Our first class was about a month ago at WCC and we have a cohort of students going through this class. … They are learning safety, quality assurance and basically how to be careful around equipment and to have good quality practices so that although they are entry level, when they go to the job they have some good common sense skills in their pocket so they can be immediately of value (to the employer). … So, 2021 for us was uncover the issues and 2022 we’re now really implementing programs that are really going to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Recognizing the shortage of workers in key industries, Westchester County has launched programs and events to attract workers. Among the industries targeted have included Hospitality, Construction and Health Care. Have these initiatives been successful and please list those sectors we missed and industries you plan to target in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Gibbons:</strong> As COVID has receded, we have been able to go back to all in-person career fairs. Hiring employees has surfaced as the biggest issue across the board for our employers in Westchester County. Thankfully, the county has the ability to convene so we have been using that power to bring together people in hospitality and construction. We had about 20 employers at the construction job fair and we had over 200 job seekers. One company hired 25 people coming out of that job fair so it was really impactful. People come to the job fairs with their resumes, with their business attire and fill out applications on the spot and it has been really successful. We had a similar event for hospitality. We also had one job fair focused on the health care sector where we partnered with the Westchester County Association where there were lines of people waiting to speak with the health care employers in the county. Coming up on June 2 we have a Job Fair for Advanced Manufacturing and then on June 30 a Job Fair for Transportation. In kind of a new area for us, in the fall we are planning an “Accessible Job Fair,” which will be for people with disabilities. … That’s an area where we are expanding our role because people with disabilities have a high unemployment rate and we see it as a “win-win” if we can help more employers hire people with disabilities. They are great workers. They are very loyal. Obviously, these folks deserve a chance to have a well-paying job and a career. So, we are really looking to make an impact and have some influence in that area.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-40970" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BOMA-Luncheon-Jan-10-1024x789.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="289" />Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Supply chain disruptions, runaway inflation and higher labor costs are impacting the development community across the nation. Recently, more than 10,000 members of the National Association of Home Builders sent a letter to President Biden where they cited rising costs stemming from historically high price levels for lumber and other building materials, supply chain bottlenecks, surging interest rates, excessive regulations and a persistent lack of construction workers for significantly decreasing housing affordability conditions. Since many projects that come before the Westchester County IDA calculated their project costs prior to the surge in inflation, are you hearing of any projects being delayed?</p>
<p><strong>Gibbons:</strong> No is the short answer. They (IDA applicants) are not coming to us and saying, “We’re stopping,” or “We’re delaying,” they are continuing to work on their projects, they just may need an extension in the time period when they can use the benefits. No one has pressed the pause button, but the reality is that some projects, not all, but some projects have come to us and said “We are going to need an extension of the time period within which we can use the IDA benefits.” I have not heard anyone delaying groundbreaking, I just think they may be working around the supply chain bottlenecks.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> Can you please detail some of the major projects that have been incentivized recently by the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency and Local Development Corp. and what impact Regeneron Pharmaceutical’s planned $1.8-billion expansion of its headquarters property in Greenburgh will have on the area economy?</p>
<p><strong>Gibbons:</strong> We (the IDA) recently gave final authorization for what was originally called “Gateway II” but is now called “25 North Lex,” a 500-unit rental apartment building at 25 Lexington Ave. in White Plains right across from the White Plains (Metro North) train station. The project will create 600 construction jobs and 20 full-time jobs once it is completed. So, that is a very important project for us. Of course, the Regeneron (expansion) projects are very, very impactful. It is a $1.8-billion investment between phase one and phase two. Phase one has gotten final authorization from the Westchester County IDA. Phase one (which is under construction) is a portion of the planned investment and is worth $480 million. Phase two has been induced by the IDA and will ultimately get final authorization. So, the total investment is $1.8 billion over six years. Between the two phases Regeneron is planning to add 1,000 employees, which is incredibly impactful from a business growth perspective. We have already had some discussions with Regeneron on how we can work with them to fill those positions because we want Westchester County residents to get those jobs. Part of what we are looking to do to assist with that is really do an inventory of the jobs that are currently available and those that will be created. We want to find out what are the needs, are there training programs and degree programs or certificates that exist now that could be feeders into those jobs? Or do we need to create new training programs in order to fill those jobs? … We are going to work closely with Regeneron on that whole initiative, which helps the bioscience industry in general. To have such a strong and large employer in the county is very attractive. Other biosciences companies want to be around that because they are so impactful. I think other bioscience firms want to be around a successful biosciences company like Regeneron and we do believe it will be a draw. It really puts Westchester County on the map. Regeneron is the largest private employer in Westchester County. Also, Westchester County represents 20% (approximately 8,000 workers) of the state’s life sciences private employment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-40972" src="http://www.realestateindepth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BusinessFirstGrantProgram.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="233" />The LDC recently approved tax-exempt bond financing for the SUNY Purchase senior living facility. That’s $385 million in tax-exempt bonds. The project is comprised of 220 independent living units, 18 assisted living beds and 16 memory care beds. It is situated right on the SUNY Purchase campus and is integrated in a way so that the seniors living there are a part of the college community so they can take classes, etc. … It&#8217;s a very innovative project that has never been done before so we are very happy with this development coming on line.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> The Westchester County Office of Economic Development accepted applications back in March for the 2022 Westchester County Business FIRST grant program, which was funded by the American Rescue Plan. This year’s grant program will provide up to $17 million to support nonprofits and religious organizations facing challenges as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Do you have updates on the program and some of the grant award winners?</p>
<p><strong>Gibbons:</strong> We sent out award letters to 160 non-profits in Westchester. They are all getting grants from us totaling just over $6 million. We are still working on grants for religious organizations. We did get grant requests from approximately 70 religious organizations. We will be reimbursing them for services that they provided to the community at large during COVID. Soup kitchens, vaccination sites, COVID testing locations (are eligible). So, we are working through those applications and hope to make an announcement soon.</p>
<p>The applications for the religious organization grants have closed. We are going to be doing another program in the near future that will likely be focused on New York State-certified or Westchester County registered MWBEs.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales slipped in April, as contract activity decreased for the sixth consecutive month, the National Association of Realtors reported today. Only the Midwest region saw signings increase month-over-month, while the other three major regions reported declines. Each of the four regions registered a drop in year-over-year contract activity.</p>
<p>The Pending Home Sales Index slid 3.9% to 99.3 in April. Year-over-year, transactions fell 9.1%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p>
<p>“Pending contracts are telling, as they better reflect the timelier impact from higher mortgage rates than do closings,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR&#8217;s chief economist. “The latest contract signings mark six consecutive months of declines and are at the slowest pace in nearly a decade.”</p>
<p>With mortgage rates rising, Yun forecasts existing-home sales to wane by 9% in 2022 and home price appreciation to moderate to 5% by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>“The escalating mortgage rates have bumped up the cost of purchasing a home by more than 25% from a year ago, while steeper home prices are adding another 15% to that figure.”</p>
<p>In some cases, these higher rates increase mortgage payments by as much as $500 per month. Yun notes that such price hikes are already a burden, but they become even more problematic to a family on a budget contending with rapid inflation, including surging fuel and food costs.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of homeowners are enjoying huge wealth gains and are not under financial stress with their home as a result of having locked into historically low interest rates, or because they are not carrying a mortgage,” Yun explained. “However – in this present market – potential homebuyers are challenged and thus may attempt to mitigate the rising cost of ownership by opting for a 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage or by widening their geographic search area to more affordable regions.”</p>
<p>Yun cites that more work-from-home opportunities have allowed would-be buyers to expand their home search.</p>
<p>There are scenarios in which the market soon improves for buyers, as well, according to Yun.</p>
<p>“If mortgage rates stabilize roughly at the current level of 5.3% and job gains continue, home sales could also stabilize in the coming months,” Yun said. “Home sales in 2022 are expected to be down about 9%, and if mortgage rates climb to 6%, then the sales activity could fall by 15%.”</p>
<p>He added, “Home prices in the meantime appear in no danger of any meaningful decline. There is an ongoing housing shortage, and properly listed homes are still selling swiftly – generally seeing a contract signed within a month.”</p>
<p><strong>April Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI fell 16.20% to 74.8 in April, a 14.3% drop from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index rose 6.6% to 100.7 last month, down 2.8% from April 2021.</p>
<p>Pending home sales transactions in the South dipped 4.7% to an index of 119.0 in April, down 10.3% from April 2021. The index in the West slipped 4.3% in April to 85.9, a 10.5% decrease from a year prior.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the staff of <em>Real Estate In-Depth r</em>egret to inform the membership and newspaper readership of the passing of John Vrooman, who died suddenly on June 5, 2022, at the age of 57 in upstate Lewiston, NY.</p>
<p>John authored “Tech Talk” in HGAR’s monthly newspaper <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> since August 2000. From day one he provided insightful and useful computer and technology advice to the more than 13,000 readers of the newspaper each month. The latest survey of its readership found that John’s column was one of the most widely read of all the columns published regularly in the newspaper.</p>
<p>He was the son of long-time Westchester Realtor Bill Vrooman and his wife Barbara. He was Vice President-Technology for the White Plains firm of Nelson-Vrooman Associates for more than 20 years prior to its merger with Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty in 2008. John was often referred to as Nelson-Vrooman’s &#8220;real estate guru&#8221;—a title he often enjoyed hearing from his fellow associates, Bill Vrooman shared. He was an Associate Broker with BH&amp;G Rand Realty for more than 11 years until his relocation to Lewiston, NY in 2019.</p>
<p>John was a graduate of White Plains High School and Ohio Wesleyan University. In addition to his affiliations with HGAR, NAR and NYSAR, he also earned the GRI and CRS designations.</p>
<p>“John so thoroughly enjoyed his role as Tech Talk columnist over the years,” said Bill Vrooman, who has been in the real estate industry for more than 50 years. “He loved doing real estate technology research to share with his Realtor colleagues through the monthly column he wrote. He was, also, so grateful and happy when one of his Realtor colleagues would e-mail him and thank him for a particular piece of information that they found so helpful.”</p>
<p>John Jordan, editor of <em>Real Estate In-Dept</em>h, said, “What has made <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> a must-read for HGAR members has been the quality of its contributors. John Vrooman for more than 21 years never took a month off and worked very hard in sharing his research and insights on the latest computer, office and personal technology trends. He took his role very seriously and his passing will leave a void that will be hard to fill. He will be missed.”</p>
<p>John’s non-business interest focused on his family, particularly his 13-year-old daughter, Sarah. He also took great pleasure from fishing in his spare time. Private services will be held to celebrate his life with family and friends in Lewiston, NY where he will be laid to rest in the family’s cemetery plot.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>The New York State Legislature gaveled out in the early hours of June 4th, marking the end of Kathy Hochul’s first session as governor and the beginning of what promises to be a chaotic election season courtesy of court-imposed electoral maps that will upend the political landscape in New York and beyond.</p>
<p>Obfuscated by the end-of-session legislative flurry that was understandably centered on public health and safety measures was another silent death for “Good Cause Eviction” and the expiration of the 421-a affordable housing tax break—at least until January, when a new legislature figures to take another swing. For now, sensible housing advocates will take a .500 batting average into the offseason.</p>
<p>Despite this success, we are certainly disappointed that another year passes without establishing transparency in the cooperative housing purchase process, or without any credible effort to address affordable housing development. This is particularly frustrating because there is active legislation that attacks housing inequity in the co-op market: Senator Brian Kavanagh, Chair of the Senate Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development, sponsored two such bills that died in committee. We know that homeownership is key to building intergenerational wealth, and know too well the long history of discrimination and segregation in cooperative housing. Continued inaction is purely political, and continues a legacy of public policy in housing that exacerbates disparate outcomes.</p>
<p>New Yorkers deserve better, and we should demand better. For too many, the pathway to homeownership is complicated by economic and historical barriers, including overlapping layers of taxes, closing costs and fees that prevent access to the residential real estate market. In 2023, HGAR will continue to strongly support legislation designed to dismantle barriers to homeownership, particularly among historically disadvantaged communities:</p>
<p>• HGAR supports enacting a first-time homebuyer savings account program to assist New Yorkers saving for their first home.</p>
<p>• HGAR supports affordable workforce housing development through tax incentives and smart zoning policies to accelerate conversion of commercial spaces into residential housing.</p>
<p>• HGAR supports direct state funding for universal broadband Internet access and</p>
<p>• HGAR supports expanding state-level student debt forgiveness programs to address onerous debt burdens that negatively impact potential homebuyers’ ability to save for a down payment or to qualify for a home loan.</p>
<p>On point of personal privilege, I want to add a quick note of thanks for the warm welcome I have received from the HGAR Board of Directors, Legislative and RPAC committees, and the incredibly talented staff and leadership team at HGAR. I look forward to our continued efforts to organize, build political power, and advance housing policy that will secure a prosperous future for all New Yorkers.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As you all may recall, back in 2021, as a part of sweeping legislation designed to curb discrimination, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a provision that empowered the New York State Division of Human Rights to “promulgate regulations requiring every housing provider … to provide notice to all tenants and prospective tenants … of their rights to request reasonable modifications and accommodations.” We know this regulation as the Reasonable Modification and Accommodation Notice. After it was signed into law, there was a 45-day comment period. That 45-day comment period ended on April 30, 2022 and the NYS Division of Human Rights published the final, approved regulations on May 18, 2022, adding 9 NYCRR 466.15 that provides guidance for compliance for all real estate licensees and landlords. The regulations include definitions, examples of reasonable modifications and accommodations as well as a sample copy of the notice. Below I have provided a breakdown of the key components.</p>
<p><strong>The Regulation</strong></p>
<p>The regulation requires real estate licensees and landlords to provide a notice that sets forth the rights a disabled individual has with regard to requesting reasonable modifications or accommodations to or in the “housing accommodation.” <strong>It applies to any and all rental properties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Broker/Agent/Team Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p>• The writing must be in 12-point font or larger, or some other easily legible font.</p>
<p>• It may be physically presented or presented by e-mail, text, electronic messaging systems or facsimile.</p>
<p>• It can be sent via an electronic communication containing a link to the notice, provided the communication also contains text to inform the prospective tenant that the link contains information regarding the tenants’ rights to reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>• Additionally, the notice must be available for printing and downloading.</p>
<p>• If the communication is in paper form, the notice may be included either with the communication or as an accompanying document.</p>
<p>• Oral notification is not permitted.</p>
<p>• Notification is not permitted by posting the notice on a bulletin board, notice area or electronic bulletin board.</p>
<p>• There is no requirement to have the form signed.</p>
<p>• Electronic delivery would provide “proof” that it was presented.</p>
<p><strong>When Presented</strong></p>
<p>• It is NYSAR’s opinion that the tenant’s agent must provide the notice to all prospective tenants.</p>
<p>• The notice <strong>must be provided at “first substantive contact”</strong> with a prospective tenant, which is similar to the notice required when providing an Agency Disclosure Form and the Housing and Anti-Discrimination Disclosure Form.</p>
<p>• It is also recommended that the notice be provided to current clients as well.</p>
<p><strong>Posting on Websites</strong></p>
<p>• A link to the division’s <strong>notice must be prominently and conspicuously displayed on the homepage of all broker/agent/team websites.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Posting at the Rental Property</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>The notice must be posted at all property locations</strong> conspicuously, in an easily accessible and well-lighted place, where it may be readily observed by those seeking such housing accommodations and/or modifications</p>
<p><strong>Posting at Real Estate Offices</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>The notice must be conspicuously displayed in all real estate offices</strong> in an easily accessible, well-lighted location where the notices may be readily observed by those seeking housing accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>Landlord/Managing Agent Requirements</strong></p>
<p>• The landlord/managing agent requirement for posting the notice are similar to those of general licensees, with only a few differences:</p>
<p>• The notice is required to be provided to a tenant <strong>within 30 days of the beginning of tenancy</strong>.</p>
<p>• The notice is required to be <strong>provided to current tenants within 30 days of the effective date of the regulation</strong> (Note: The regulation became effective 3/2/21, so the notice must be provided as soon as possible for current tenants).</p>
<p>• If provided in writing, it must be in 12-point font or larger, or another easily legible font.</p>
<p>• It must include the telephone number(s) and e-mail of the property manager or other person responsible for accepting reasonable accommodation requests.</p>
<p>• It can be sent via an electronic communication containing a link to the notice, provided the communication also contains text to inform the prospective tenant that the link contains information regarding the tenants’ rights to reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>• Additionally, the notice must be available for printing and downloading.</p>
<p>• If the communication is in paper form, the notice may be included either with the communication or as an accompanying document.</p>
<p>• The notice can be included with other written communications, such as a lease or other materials routinely provided to tenants.</p>
<p>• Oral notification is not permitted.</p>
<p>• Notification is not permitted by posting the notice on a bulletin board, notice area, or electronic bulletin board.</p>
<p>• There is no requirement to have the form signed.</p>
<p>• Electronic delivery would provide “proof” that it was presented.</p>
<p><strong>NYSAR Forms</strong></p>
<p>NYSAR has developed two notices.</p>
<p>• One is for when the licensee knows the managing agent information where accommodation or modification questions, requests and/or complaints should be addressed.</p>
<p>• One is for when the licensee does not know the managing agent information where accommodation or modification questions, requests and/or complaints should be addressed.</p>
<p>• To access NYSAR’s sample notices, you can go to the NYSAR website at:  <a href="http://nysar.com/">nysar.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Compliance with the Reasonable Accommodation and Modification Notice is not difficult. It is very similar to other regulatory requirements when it comes to posting and presenting. It is important that licensees, especially Brokers, speak to their legal counsel to ensure proper compliance. Lastly, as a final note, NYSAR recommends that licensees do not advise their owners on how to comply with this law. Simply inform them that the law exists, that there are compliance rules that they and the licensee must comply with, and direct them to their own counsel for further questions.</p>
<p>Additional questions regarding the Reasonable Accommodation and Modification Notice can be directed to the NYSAR Legal Hotline. The Legal Hotline is available Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m.- 4:00 p.m. at 518-436-9727.</p>
