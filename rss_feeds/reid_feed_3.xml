    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Foreign buyers purchased $42 billion worth of U.S. existing homes from April 2023 through March 2024, retreating 21.2% from the prior 12-month period, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors released on July 17.</p><p>International buyers purchased 54,300 properties, down 36% from the previous year and the fewest number of homes bought since 2009 when NAR began tracking this data. Overall, U.S. existing-home sales totaled 4.09 million in 2023, down 18.7% from 2022, and the lowest level since 1995.</p><p>“The strong U.S. dollar makes international travel cheaper for Americans but makes U.S. homes much more expensive for foreigners,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Therefore, it's not surprising to see a pullback in U.S. home sales from foreign buyers."</p><p>NAR's “2024 International Transactions in U.S. Residential Real Estate” report surveyed members about transactions with international clients who purchased and sold U.S. residential property from April 2023 through March 2024. Foreign buyers who resided in the U.S. as recent immigrants or who were holding visas that allowed them to live in the U.S. purchased $22.6 billion worth of U.S. existing homes, a 3.4% decline from the previous year and representing 54% of the dollar volume of purchases. Foreign buyers who lived abroad purchased $19.4 billion worth of existing homes, down 35% from the 12 months prior and accounting for 46% of the dollar volume. International buyers accounted for 2% of the $2.1 trillion in total U.S. existing-home sales during that period.</p><p>“Historically low housing inventory and escalating prices remain significant factors in constraining home sales for American and international buyers alike,” Yun added.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/07/number-of-existing-home-purchases-by-foreign-buyers-2014-to-2024-stacked-bar-graph-07-17-2024-1300w-746h.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="689" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/number-of-existing-home-purchases-by-foreign-buyers-2014-to-2024-stacked-bar-graph-07-17-2024-1300w-746h.webp 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/number-of-existing-home-purchases-by-foreign-buyers-2014-to-2024-stacked-bar-graph-07-17-2024-1300w-746h.webp 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/07/number-of-existing-home-purchases-by-foreign-buyers-2014-to-2024-stacked-bar-graph-07-17-2024-1300w-746h.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The average ($780,300) and median ($475,000) existing-home sales prices among international buyers were the highest ever recorded by NAR—and 21.9% and 19.8% higher, respectively, than the prior year. The increase in prices for foreign buyers reflected the overall price increase for all U.S. existing homes, which climbed to $392,600. At $1.3 million, Chinese buyers had the highest average purchase price, with 25% purchasing property in California. In total, 18% of international buyers purchased properties worth more than $1 million from April 2023 to March 2024.<br><br>Canada led all countries of origin in the share of foreign buyer purchases of U.S. existing homes at 13%, followed by China and Mexico (11% each), and India (10%). China was first in U.S. residential sales dollar volume at $7.5 billion, continuing a trend going back to 2013. Canada ($5.9 billion), India ($4.1 billion), Mexico ($2.8 billion) and Colombia ($0.7 billion) rounded out the top five.<br><br>For the 16th consecutive year, Florida remained the top destination for foreign buyers, accounting for 20% of all international purchases. Texas (13%) and California (11%) were second and third, respectively, followed by Arizona (5%), Georgia, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina (4% each).<br><br>All-cash sales accounted for half of international buyer transactions compared to 28% of all existing-home buyers. Non-resident foreign buyers (68%) were more likely to make an all-cash purchase than resident foreign buyers (36%). More than two-thirds of Canadian (69%) and Chinese (68%) buyers made all-cash purchases, the highest shares among the top foreign buyer nations.<br><br>“Fostering economic investment in culturally dynamic communities, businesses, and industries is a top priority for NAR,” said Alex Escudero, NAR's director of global strategy. "Our work provides members and their communities with tools, resources and data to identify and highlight international investment opportunities in U.S. real estate. This supports local communities to drive economic development in markets across the country.<br><br>He continued, “NAR and the Realtor brand have developed a network of more than 8,000 international Realtor members outside of the USA and expanded our global footprint to more than 100 real estate organizations across 78 countries, providing growth opportunities by ensuring ethical and accessible markets that allow our members to make direct connections with global-minded real estate professionals and international investors."<br><br>NAR will host its "Unlocking Global Opportunities" webinar on Wednesday, July 31, at 1 p.m. Eastern, where experts will discuss the findings of this year's report, and Realtors will share their personal experiences with international investment and how it has expanded their business.

    <description><![CDATA[OneKey has established that effective Aug. 8, 2024, they will no longer display any offers of cooperating compensation to any cooperating brokers. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="article">Article:</h3><p>On March 15, 2024, the National Association of Realtors entered into a proposed settlement agreement with various plaintiff homeowners to resolve nationwide litigation concerning broker commissions. Effective August 17, 2024, certain practices and changes must be adopted by all Realtors to comply with these settlement agreement provisions. Here is a breakdown of those requirements and an overview of the new forms that have been created by the New York State Association of Realtors (NYSAR).</p><h3 id="changes-to-mls-policy">Changes to MLS Policy</h3><p>Effective Aug. 17, 2024, all MLSs, including OneKey MLS, must implement new policies.</p><p>Therefore, OneKey has established that effective Aug. 8, 2024, they will no longer display any offers of cooperating compensation to any cooperating brokers. Additionally, OneKey will no longer permit any reference to cooperating compensation in agent or public remarks. Further, the MLS may not facilitate the sharing of cooperating compensation, so tools, such as ShowingTime, may not be used to disseminate cooperating compensation information.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that cooperating compensation is still permissible, and a brokerage and its agents can still market a client’s cooperating compensation on any other platform (example: website, social media, billboard, flyer, telephone, text, etc.), so long as they only share their offered cooperating compensation and not other brokerage’s cooperating compensation.</p><p>Effective July 23, 2024, OneKey will also be providing a new field for seller concessions. OneKey will provide a dropdown box where the seller can acknowledge if they will or will not entertain a seller’s concession. If the “Yes” box is selected, then the seller has the option of putting in a specific dollar amount that the seller will offer as a concession; however, this amount is not required. It should also be noted that a seller concession cannot be restricted or earmarked for compensation to cooperating brokers and a seller’s concession is not a substitute or a workaround for marketing cooperating compensation.</p><h3 id="buyer-agent-agreements">Buyer Agent Agreements</h3><p>In addition to the MLS changes, effective Aug. 17, 2024, all Realtors that represent buyers must obtain a signed written buyer agreement prior to touring a home. This applies only to Realtors who are representing buyers, so agents that represent only the seller (example: an open house) will not require a buyer agreement to show the property. This agreement must state that all commissions are not established by law and are freely negotiable. It must also provide for a conspicuous specific buyer commission that is objectively ascertainable and not open-ended. Such phrases as, “buyer will pay whatever the seller is offering” would not be permissible. Finally, it must state that the Realtor is prohibited from receiving any cooperating compensation in excess of the amount authorized by the buyer.<br><br>NYSAR has prepared an exclusive buyer agency agreement, as well as a non-exclusive buyer agency agreement, which can be used on an ad hoc basis based upon the buyer’s desire to see certain properties only. Both agreements establish that the buyer will agree to pay the buyer agent’s commission and that there is a cap to that compensation. They also provide that the buyer agent may seek cooperating compensation from the seller or listing agent to offset what the buyer would be obligated to pay; however, the buyer will ultimately be responsible for the full commission or any outstanding remainder if any cooperating compensation does not satisfy the buyer compensation in the contract. It further addresses the fact that if dual agency (either direct or designated) takes place, the buyer would be obligated to pay the entire amount of buyer compensation and the buyer would not be able to avail itself of any cooperating compensation, as dual agency effectively negates any offers of cooperating compensation (cooperating compensation is only offered between two brokers and is not available if only one broker is a party to both sides of the transaction). However, if a broker utilizes the NYSAR Exclusive Listing Agreement, addressed below, the buyer’s agent could receive compensation pursuant to the dual agency provision in that form.<br><br>Finally, the forms provide a dispute resolution provision that requires the parties to submit the NAR-authorized mediation and/or arbitration on the local association level if a dispute arises, as well as prohibiting the parties from engaging in litigation or participating in a class action lawsuit.</p><h3 id="exclusive-listing-agreements">Exclusive Listing Agreements</h3><p>As a result of the settlement agreement, listing agreements must also be modified. In addition to a provision that conspicuously states that commissions are not set by law and are freely negotiable, any reference to cooperating compensation being submitted and marketed through the MLS must be removed.</p><p>NYSAR’s new form provides separate sections for commissions. The first provision establishes the listing agent commission. It then provides for a provision for a modification to that commission in the event that there arises a dual agency or unrepresented buyer situation. These commissions are negotiated in advance.</p><p>The second provision is to decide whether or not the seller will offer cooperating compensation. They are under no obligation to offer out compensation; however, if they choose to offer out cooperating compensation, they must determine from the outset whether that compensation will come directly from the seller or through the listing broker. That provision also establishes who will be offered cooperating compensation (example, buyer agent, broker agent, subagent, etc.) as well as the pre-negotiated amount. It is important to note that even if a seller does not offer cooperating compensation, a buyer (or a buyer’s agent at the direction of the buyer) can request cooperating compensation and the seller can negotiate such request.</p><p>Like the buyer’s agreement, all disputes are to be handled through a NAR tribunal at the local association level, as well as provide a prohibition on litigation or joining a class action.</p><h3 id="cooperating-compensation-agreement-seller-andor-listing-broker">Cooperating Compensation Agreement (Seller and/or Listing Broker)</h3><p>Historically, the contract for the payment of cooperating compensation was established by membership in the MLS and a posting of that cooperating compensation on the MLS. That offer of cooperating compensation was unconditional, and a broker could rely on their membership agreement to bind the parties. Disputes were handled through NAR-authorized mediation/arbitration, as per the MLS membership.</p><p>Since cooperating compensation can no longer be published on the MLS, a contract is needed between the seller or listing broker and the cooperating broker to memorialize the cooperating compensation being offered and contractually bind the parties. NYSAR has created two forms. One is an agreement between the seller and the cooperating broker; the other is an agreement between the listing broker and the cooperating broker. Both are similar insofar as they establish that either the seller or the listing broker (depending on which form you use) contractually agrees to pay the cooperating broker a commission. They also set forth who is being offered cooperating compensation (buyer agent, broker agent, subagent) and what that compensation is. They both establish that any dispute will be handled by a NAR-approved body on the local level. Their only difference is that the seller’s cooperating compensation document provides further details on cooperating compensation, including an explanation of duties, cooperating compensation, and the negotiability of cooperating compensation, as the party contracting to pay the commission is a member of the public and may not fully familiar with these provisions.</p><p>After both parties have signed the forms, they are legally bound by its terms and conditions. If a party fails to pay, the harmed party (the cooperating broker) can take this document and file a complaint under Article 17 of the Code of Ethics to seek enforcement.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>We all need to be aware of these upcoming changes and pivot to understand and embrace them well in advance of the proposed deadline. The forms referenced in this article can be found at <a href="https://www.nysar.com/legal/forms/">https://www.nysar.com/legal/forms/</a>. Also, on that website, below the links to those forms, you can find a link to a guide on how to use those forms. Additional information will be coming from HGAR, NYSAR and NAR in the form of webinars, meetings, postings, videos, and other resources. As always, a great source of information is NAR’s site <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts" rel="noreferrer">facts.realtor</a>. Check out these sites when you can.</p><p>Make sure you remain aware of updates as this situation continues to unfold. HGAR will proactively reach out to its membership with reminders and opportunities to learn more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Sales were down in all counties in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors market area, with Orange County posting the largest decline in single-family home sales at 26.9%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="westchester-hits-a-new-record-sales-price-of-103-million"><em>Westchester Hits a New Record Sales Price of $1.03 Million</em></h2><p>WHITE PLAINS—Median sales prices for single-family homes continued to rise in June, with the exception of Sullivan County, which experienced a decline of 5.1%. Westchester County once again reached a new record high for the median single-family home price at $1,031,500 in June—a 12.7% increase over last year’s median home price of $915,000.</p><p>Putnam County posted the highest gain of 19.2%, bringing its June 2024 median sales price to $590,000, as compared to last year’s median price of $495,000.</p><p>Sales were down in all counties in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors market area, with Orange County posting the largest decline in single-family home sales at 26.9%, followed by Putnam and Sullivan counties, which posted the same 16.9% fall-off in sales activity.</p><p>Closed sales in the condo markets were down or flat for every market with the exception of the Bronx, which enjoyed a 14.3% increase in sales last month. However, the Bronx median condo price, after growing 42% in May, fell 18.7% in June to $333,250. Westchester’s condo and co-op median prices increased by about 3.3% and 15%, respectively to $511,000 and $215,000. In Rockland County, the median condo price rose 5.8% to $399,000 and the co-op median rose 5.0% to $126,000.</p><p>Inventory of single-family homes plummeted in all areas except Sullivan County, which experienced a 7.2% increase. Putnam County posted the highest for overall pending sales for all property types with a 19.5% increase in June. The only other county to post positive overall pending sales was Sullivan at 2.5%.</p><p>Today’s report released by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR), based on data supplied by OneKey® MLS, offers mixed results for the home sales market, which continues to deal with high mortgage rates, low inventory, and strong demand. Those three market forces are causing prices to continue to rise throughout the region. As the month ended, a number of positive economic reports clearly showed inflation is cooling and analysts are now expecting the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates as early as its sessions in September. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.92% in June, according to Freddie Mac and ended the month at 6.86%.</p><p>“Limited supply and strong demand continue to be the driving forces in our markets right now, particularly for single-family homes,” said HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez. “We expect lower interest rates and higher levels of inventory to help stabilize pricing and to generate more home sales in future months.”</p><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Single-family home sales decreased by 10.9% in June 2024 and the median sales price rose sharply by 12.5% to $675,000. Last month, the median was $610,000, and last year at this time it was $600,000. Condo sales rose by 14.3%, and the median price declined by 18.7% with a new median of $333,250. This was lower than the median in May 2024 of $350,000 and last year’s median of $410,000. Sales in the co-op market saw a 20.6% decline, but a 37% increase in the median sales price to $253,500. The median co-op sales price in June 2023 was $185,000.</p><p>New Bronx listings for condos rose 3.2%, while co-ops fell 4.4%. Single-family homes listings dropped by 16.2%. Overall inventory for all three housing types was down significantly, with single-family homes posting the largest fall-off at 35.1%, followed by condos at 22% and co-ops at 10.8% lower. As of June, there were 6.4 months of supply, down by 14.7% from last month. Overall pending sales for all property types were down by 19.2%.</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>In a reversal from May, sales of single-family homes declined by 13.3%, and the median sales price shot up by 12.7% to a new high of $1,031,500. In June 2023, the median price for a single-family home stood at $915,000. In May 2024, the median price reached the previous all-time record of $980,000. The condo market also experienced a drop in sales in June at 7.7%, and a 3.3% hike in the median sales price to $511,000. Closed sales declined by 13.0% in the co-op market, however, the median sales price grew by 15% to $215,000.</p><p>New listings declined for all housing types—condos by 27.4% co-ops by 3.4% and 3.1% fewer single-family home listings. Overall inventory for all property types declined, with co-ops seeing the largest decrease at 27.4%, followed by condos at 18.9% and single-family homes at 17.1%. Months of supply was down 10.3% to just 2.6 months, and pending sales dropped 9.4%.</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Single-family home sales in Putnam County suffered a 16.9% decline in June, and condo transactions retreated by 8.3% as compared to activity in June 2023. The median sales price for single-family homes soared by 19.2% to $590,000—up from $495,000 in June of 2023. The median sale price of a condominium in Putnam County fell 3.7% in June 2024 to $375,500 as compared to $389,900 a year earlier. There was just one sale of a cooperative unit in Putnam County in June 2024.</p><p>Single-family home listings in June shot up 24.5% as compared to June 2023. New listings for condos increased by 10%. Months of supply for all property types was higher by 6.9%, pushing it up from 2.8 months in May to 3.1 months in June. On another positive note, pending sales in June 2024 shot up 19.5% in Putnam County, after falling by 6.3% the previous month.</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Rockland’s co-op market, albeit a small segment, suffered a 55.6% decline in sales (based on four transactions) in June.

The median single-family home price in June 2024 stood at $720,000, a 7.9% increase from the $667,500 median recorded a year earlier. However, the June 2024 median sale price was down sharply from the $776,000 median posted a month earlier.

Single-family home listings rose 13.7% in June 2024, while condo new listings dropped by 9.3% as compared to a year earlier. Months of supply for all property types was 3.6% higher to 2.9 months, while pending sales were down by 10.7%.</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>In Orange County, sales of single-family homes fell sharply by 26.9%, while condo closings remained flat as compared to June 2023.

    <description><![CDATA[One requirement of the law mandating the use of written contracts for compensation will impact NYS brokers significantly.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—The New York State Association of Realtors issued a “Broker Flash Update” to its members earlier today warning them that a new law enacting new requirements in the independent contractor relationship between the real estate broker and associated licensees goes into effect on Aug. 28, 2024.</p><p>The following is the full text of NYSAR’s Legal Update distributed this morning:</p><p>“Dear Broker,</p><p>Effective August 28, 2024, a new law impacting the independent contractor relationship between a broker and associated licensees will go into effect. This new law is NOT part of the NAR lawsuit settlement. The new law is called the “Freelance Isn’t Free Act” (FIFA) and was modeled after a law that has been in effect in New York City. The new law can be found under Article 44-A of the General Business Law. The purpose of the law is to expand protections for independent contractors (referred to as “Freelance Worker” in the law) as well as additional requires for those individuals or entities that utilize independent contractors as part of their business (such as real estate brokers). This article will focus on how FIFA impacts real estate brokers that utilize independent contractors in NY.</p><p>One requirement of the law mandating the use of written contracts for compensation will impact NYS brokers significantly. According to FIFA, a broker is required to have a written contract between the broker and the independent contractor. The broker must furnish a copy of such written contract, either physically or electronically, to the independent contractor and each party to the written contract shall retain a copy thereof. The broker is required to keep a copy of the contract for a period of six years and make the contract available to the NYS Attorney General upon request.</p><p>The written contract must contain the following:</p><p>a) Name and address of broker and independent contractor.</p><p>b) Itemization of all services to be provided by the independent contractor pursuant to the contract and the rate and method of compensation.</p><p>c) The date on which the broker must pay the contracted compensation or the mechanism by which such date will be determined.</p><p>d) The date the independent contractor must submit a list of services rendered under the contract to the broker in order to meet any internal processing deadlines of the broker for the purposes of compensation being timely rendered by the agreed upon date required under (c) (above).</p><p>NYSAR has developed a new independent contractor agreement that includes the requirements of the law (other than the broker being required to have a separate written agreement for compensation). The new independent contractor agreement can be used throughout New York State and New York City (as compared to the current requirement of using a different form for NYC).</p><p>NYSAR has included spaces for the names and addresses of the broker and independent contractor (referred to as “sales associate” in the independent contractor agreement). In order to list the itemization of services (required under (b) above), NYSAR has reproduced the language found in Real Property Law §440 that sets forth what is considered a licensed real estate activity (paragraph 14 of the NYSAR independent contractor agreement). Real estate brokers that require their independent contractors to perform services outside of those listed in Real Property Law §440 would need to add those services to the independent contractor agreement.</p><p>In paragraph 15 of the independent contractor agreement, NYSAR has included language that the independent contractor shall be paid a commission on sales without deduction for taxes. NYSAR also included language that any such commission shall be paid when the sales associate is the “procuring cause” of a transaction that closes. Brokers will need to develop a separate written agreement setting forth how much the independent contractor will be compensated (commonly referred to as the “split”). Furthermore, FIFA requires the independent contractor to be paid within 30 days of the receipt of the full commission paid to the broker or under a different time frame contained in the separate written agreement between the broker and independent contractor. For instance, a broker may have a policy where all independent contractors are paid on the last day of the month that immediately follows the closing. If the broker has a policy that differs from the 30-day requirement, they need to include that in the separate written agreement. It is recommended that brokers have their attorney review the separate written agreement for compliance with the law.</p><p>The FIFA law also includes anti-retaliatory language to protect independent contractors who exercise their rights under the FIFA law. NYSAR has included such language in paragraph 16 of the independent contractor agreement “Broker shall not threaten, intimidate, discipline, harass, deny a work opportunity to or discriminate against a Sales Associate, or take any other action that penalizes a Sales Associate for, or is reasonably likely to deter a Sales Associate from, exercising or attempting to exercise any right guaranteed under the law, or from obtaining future work opportunity because the Sales Associate has done so.”</p><p>Brokers will need to use the new independent contractor agreement and develop a separate written agreement for all licensees currently associated with the broker as an independent contractor (this includes existing and new independent contractors) on or before August 28, 2024.</p><p>The sample NYSAR independent contractor agreement can be found here: <a href="https://www.nysar.com/legal/forms/">https://www.nysar.com/legal/forms/</a></p><p>NYSAR members with questions about the law and compliance may contact NYSAR’s legal hotline. The legal hotline is available Monday-Friday from 9:00 am-4:00 pm at 518-436-9727.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales fell in June as the median sales price climbed to the highest price ever recorded for the second consecutive month, according to a report released earlier today (July 23) by the National Association of Realtors. All four major U.S. regions posted sales declines. Year-over-year, sales waned in the Northeast, Midwest and South but were unchanged in the West.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—receded 5.4% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.89 million in June. Year-over-year, sales also dropped 5.4% (down from 4.11 million in June 2023).</p><p>“We’re seeing a slow shift from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Homes are sitting on the market a bit longer, and sellers are receiving fewer offers. More buyers are insisting on home inspections and appraisals, and inventory is definitively rising on a national basis.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of June was 1.32 million units, up 3.1% from May and 23.4% from one year ago (1.07 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 4.1-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.7 months in May and 3.1 months in June 2023. The last time unsold inventory posted a four-month supply was May 2020 (4.5 months).</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in June was $426,900, an all-time high and an increase of 4.1% from one year ago ($410,100). All four U.S. regions registered price gains.</p><p>“Even as the median home price reached a new record high, further large accelerations are unlikely,” Yun added. “Supply and demand dynamics are nearing a balanced market condition. The month’s supply of inventory reached its highest level in more than four years.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 22 days in June, down from 24 days in May but up from 18 days in June 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in June, down from 31% in May but up from 27% in June 2023. NAR’s “2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers”—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in June, unchanged from May and up from 26% one year ago.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in June, identical to May and down from 18% in June 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in June, unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates">Mortgage Rates</h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.77% as of July 18. That’s down from 6.89% one week ago and 6.78% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales">Single-family and Condo/Co-op Sales</h3><p>Single-family home sales retracted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.52 million in June, down 5.1% from 3.71 million in May and 4.3% from the prior year. The median existing single-family home price was $432,700 in June, up 4.1% from June 2023.</p><p>Existing condominium and co-op sales tumbled 7.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 370,000 units, down 14% from one year ago (430,000 units). The median existing condo price was $371,700 in June, up 2.6% from the previous year ($362,200).</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown">Regional Breakdown</h3><p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast in June withdrew 2.1% from May to an annual rate of 470,000, a decline of 6% from June 2023. The median price in the Northeast was $521,500, up 9.7% from one year earlier.</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales decreased 8% from one month ago to an annual rate of 920,000 in June, down 6.1% from the prior year. The median price in the Midwest was $327,100, up 5.5% from June 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South slid 5.9% from May to an annual rate of 1.76 million in June, down 6.9% from one year before. The median price in the South was $373,000, up 1.7% from last year.</p><p>In the West, existing-home sales declined 2.6% in June to an annual rate of 740,000, identical to a year ago. The median price in the West was $629,800, up 3.5% from June 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[According to the FBI’s 2023 Internet Crime Complaint Center Report, there were more than 101,068 complaints filed by individuals over 60 years old resulting in more than $3.4 billion in losses in 2023.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 12, 2024, the Office of the Attorney General announced the conviction of the leader of a deed theft ring in Queens that stole homes owned by the elderly, disabled individuals, or their estates [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Y1EAY3">https://bit.ly/3Y1EAY3</a>]. Unfortunately, deed theft (also known as home title theft) and real estate fraud have been on an alarming rise not only in New York State but throughout the entire country. An individual was charged in Detroit for stealing more than 30 homes [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4dmNOmf">https://bit.ly/4dmNOmf</a>]. This devastating crime leaves its victims and their family members devasted. As with all fraud and criminal activity, while it will be impossible to eliminate it entirely, it is very important for the public, and particularly real estate professionals, to be aware of these threats and predatory schemes so they may be prevented as much as possible.</p><h3 id="significant-losses-due-to-elder-fraud-and-real-estate-fraud">Significant Losses Due to Elder Fraud and Real Estate Fraud</h3><p>Real estate and other financial fraud involving the elderly include forged, coerced or fraudulently obtained signatures on legal documents, illegal use of powers of attorney and scams that target an individual’s money or property are increasing year after year. According to the FBI’s 2023 Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Report [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3WsebQT">https://bit.ly/3WsebQT</a>], there were more than 101,068 complaints filed by individuals over 60 years old resulting in more than $3.4 billion in losses in 2023. This represents a 14% increase over 2022. The FBI’s IC3 also prepares an annual Elder Fraud Report [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3W5TREC">https://bit.ly/3W5TREC</a>]. The 2023 IC3 Elder Report indicates that 1,498 individuals over the age of 60 lost more than $65 million in real estate scams in 2023, which was an increase of more than 14% over 2022.</p><h3 id="the-unsuspecting-targets-of-the-deed-fraud-scheme">The Unsuspecting Targets of the Deed Fraud Scheme</h3><p>There are many different ways that criminal actors perpetrate these frauds. These individuals search for properties that do not have mortgages and are free from liens. Many times, these criminals will target properties owned by elderly or disabled individuals, or individuals who may not live in the area, live out-of-state, or who own rental properties.</p><p>These predators also target properties owned by individuals who have recently passed away. The criminals will read obituaries published in the newspapers or on funeral home websites or search the Internet. They then conduct a search of public real estate records to determine whether the deceased individuals owned any real property.</p><p>Once an individual, an estate, and a specific property are targeted, the perpetrators then engage in the usual methods of identity theft, such as e-mail fraud, direct phone calls, mail theft, and a variety of other means, in order to obtain Social Security numbers, driver’s license information and other personally identifiable information. Oftentimes, they use forged or false identity documents to pose as the owner of the property and sell the property to an unsuspecting purchaser. Other times, they simply transfer the property to themselves or to an entity formed by them so they may subsequently sell it to an unsuspecting purchaser.</p><p>Another common, and even more pernicious, method these criminals use is to target elderly individuals who may be suffering from dementia, Alzheimer’s, or may be affected by some other form of physical or mental ailment, or are in financial distress. They usually target an individual who does not have any family, has limited family interaction, or has family members who do not visit frequently or do not live locally. These criminals befriend these vulnerable individuals and work their way into their lives, seemingly being seen as a savior; then when least expected, these criminals have the victim unknowingly execute a power of attorney, sign the deed to the property over to them, or, in some instances, even have them sign a Will leaving everything to the criminal.</p><h3 id="the-real-estate-professional-yet-another-target">The Real Estate Professional: Yet Another Target</h3><p>Once these criminals have stolen their victim’s identity, or have obtained title to the property through some fraudulent manner, they then attempt to sell the property to an unknowing purchaser. The real estate agent then becomes the next target. The Secret Service has issued an advisory relating to real estate scams involving vacant land which should be utilized as a tool by all real estate agents to discern potential red flags when contacted by a client who may be involved in a fraudulent transaction [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4czL2db">https://bit.ly/4czL2db</a>]. The Secret Service Advisory points out the following:</p><ul>
<li>The criminal, posing as the owner, will reach out to a real estate agent to list the property for sale or to locate a purchaser.</li>
<li>The property will usually consist of vacant land or rental properties.</li>
<li>They will usually look to list the property below current market value and request that they prefer an “all cash” purchaser so that an offer is accepted quickly, and a transaction can close quickly.</li>
<li>The criminal refuses to sign closing documents in person and requests a remote closing.</li>
<li>The criminal (or a co-conspirator) also impersonates the notary and delivers falsified documents to the title company.</li>
<li>All communication is electronic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Secret Service also provides the real estate agent and other real estate professionals with the following prevention tips:</p><ul>
<li>Independently search for the identity and a recent picture of the seller.</li>
<li>Request an in-person meeting or virtual meeting and to see their government-issued identification.</li>
<li>Be on alert when a seller accepts an offer below market value in exchange for receiving the payment in cash and/or closing quickly.</li>
<li>Never allow sellers to arrange their own notary closing.</li>
<li>Use trusted title companies and attorneys for the exchange of Closing documents and funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important for real estate agents, and other real estate professionals, to ensure the person they are working with is the actual person he or she portends to be. If there is any doubt, an enquiry should be made for additional identification. It is not uncommon for prospective clients to reach out to real estate agents and attorneys and indicate they are out-of-state, and they own property locally and need assistance. It is important, especially with the availability of video-conferencing tools, to have video conferences with all prospective clients. If they are local, then it is recommended to have a live in-person meeting with all clients. If the client refuses, this should raise a red flag. It is important for all real estate brokers to educate their licensed salespersons on this growing fraud so they may deal with and report any issues before it is too late.</p><h3 id="tips-for-homeowners-to-prevent-discover-potential-fraud">Tips for Homeowners to Prevent &amp; Discover Potential Fraud</h3><p>The Attorney General’s Office provides additional tips for homeowners to discover potentially fraudulent activities [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3y8Q4yb">https://bit.ly/3y8Q4yb</a>]. For homeowners who are in financial distress, they should beware of any individuals or entities who “promise” or “guarantee” certain results, such as loan modifications or other assistance or outcomes with existing mortgages. Homeowners should avoid paying any upfront fees for loan modifications. Homeowners should also never agree to sign over their deed to a mortgage assistance company or individual. A reputable company will never request that a deed be transferred to receive any mortgage assistance.<br><br>For individuals who reside in New York City, it is recommended that they register to receive notifications of legal changes, including ownership changes, to their property [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3LsDVr5">https://bit.ly/3LsDVr5</a>]. Homeowners should check with their local County Clerk’s Office to see if there is a similar notification option. It is also recommended that homeowners proactively and periodically check the tax department’s records and County Clerk’s deed records at least annually, and even more frequently.</p><p>It is also important to be aware of sudden changes, such as not receiving tax, utility or other bills. New York City’s ACRIS System allows individuals to easily access property records. Other counties may offer similar access. The Westchester County Clerk’s office sends a letter to the homeowner alerting them to the fact that a new deed has been filed. Many towns and villages also allow homeowners to search tax records, which should be done periodically, as any changes to the record owner appearing on the tax records usually indicate that a new deed has been recorded.</p><p>For those victims who are elderly or who may be suffering from mental or physical ailments, it is much more difficult for these individuals to proactively take steps to avoid or prevent deed fraud, home title theft, or mortgage fraud. It is incumbent on family members, or close friends, if they are able, to take these steps on behalf of their vulnerable relatives and friends. It is also important for members of the public, and neighbors, to alert the authorities of any potential fraud or criminality if they witness any suspicious activity taking place.</p><h3 id="the-threat-of-deed-and-other-fraud-is-growing-the-industry-must-fight-back">The Threat of Deed and Other Fraud is Growing: The Industry Must Fight Back</h3><p>New threats are introduced every day when it comes to fraud and criminal schemes, and everyone can do their part to fight these threats. If anyone has any information regarding home title theft, the Office of the Attorney General should be contacted by calling 1 (800) 771-7755, by emailing <a>deedtheft@ag.ny.gov</a>, or by filing an anonymous complaint online by accessing the following link: <a href="https://bit.ly/46arbPb">https://bit.ly/46arbPb</a>. The local authorities should be contacted as well.</p><p>A real estate transaction is one of the most significant financial transactions an individual undertakes in a lifetime and a person’s home is usually the largest single (if not the only) asset that person owns. Deed theft can strip this asset from individuals instantly, the effects of which are not only devastating to the victims, but to their families as well. It is important for the public and real estate professionals to be vigilant and remain informed of all types of fraud so that these crimes can be prevented.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in June increased 4.8%, according to data released today (July 31) by the National Association of Realtors. All four U.S. regions posted monthly gains in transactions. Year-over-year, the Northeast, Midwest and South registered declines, while the West increased.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—grew to 74.3 in June. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 2.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“The rise in housing inventory is beginning to lead to more contract signings,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Multiple offers are less intense, and buyers are in a more favorable position.”</p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI rose 3.0% from last month to 65.5, a decline of 0.3% from June 2023. The Midwest index increased 4.7% to 73.7 in June, down 4.2% from one year ago.</p><p>The South PHSI increased 6.3% to 89.3 in June, dropping 3.9% from the prior year. The West index climbed 3.4% in June to 58.4, up 1.0% from June 2023.</p><p>"Even more inventory is expected to come onto the housing market in the upcoming months ahead of the normal, seasonal declines in the winter," added Yun. "The Northeast's small gain in contract signings is due to the ongoing housing shortage situation in that region, leading to stronger home price gains. It is a good time to list."</p><p>Pending contracts are good early indicators of upcoming sales closings. However, the amount of time between pending contracts and completed sales is not identical for all home sales. Variations in the length of the process from pending contract to closed sale can be caused by issues such as buyer difficulties with obtaining mortgage financing, home inspection problems, or appraisal issues.</p><p>The index is based on a sample that covers about 40% of multiple listing service data each month. In developing the model for the index, it was demonstrated that the level of monthly sales-contract activity parallels the level of closed existing-home sales in the following two months.</p><p>An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which was the first year to be examined. By coincidence, the volume of existing-home sales in 2001 fell within the range of 5.0 to 5.5 million, which is considered normal for the current U.S. population, NAR officials stated.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/07/2024-06-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-07-31-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/2024-06-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-07-31-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/07/2024-06-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-07-31-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The new rules mean sellers still have the choice of offering compensation to buyer brokers, which can serve as a way of marketing the home or making the listing more attractive to buyers.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—As a result of a $418-million class action lawsuit settlement involving the National Association of Realtors (NAR), new nationwide changes to Multiple Listing Services (MLS) must be completed by Aug. 17 and updates to the OneKey MLS will occur tomorrow (Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024).</p><p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors reminds members, real estate professionals and consumers on what these changes, which may influence how consumers negotiate and provide compensation to their buyer or seller agents and brokers, mean for their homebuying and selling experiences.</p><p>“At HGAR we believe in being pro-active and informing our members and the public about how these new MLS rules will impact their home buying and selling procedures,” said Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO. “Consumers need to be fully aware of their options when choosing a listing agent to sell their home or working with a buyer’s agent when searching for a home. The key takeaway is that commission compensations are always negotiable.”</p><p><strong>For Home Sellers</strong></p><p>The new rules mean sellers still have the choice of offering compensation to buyer brokers, which can serve as a way of marketing the home or making the listing more attractive to buyers. Agents must also disclose in writing and obtain approval for any payment or offer of payment that the listing agent will make to another agent or broker who is acting for the buyers. The amount or percentage of payment must also be specified in writing.</p><p>If the seller does choose to approve an offer of compensation for the buyer’s agent, the listing agent cannot include it on the MLS. However, sellers can still offer buyer concessions (for example closing costs) on the MLS. Compensation to the listing agent remains fully negotiable.</p><p><strong>For Home Buyers</strong></p><p>On the buying side, home seekers will need a written agreement with their agent before touring a home. Buyers can negotiate the terms of the agreement, which must include a written disclosure from the agent or broker stating that fees and commissions are fully negotiable and not set by law. The homebuyer and agent must also sign an agreement about the specific amount or percentage of compensation that the buyer’s agent will receive. Written agreements apply to both in-person and live virtual home tours.</p><p>The buyer agreement limits (caps) the amount the buyer agent can receive to the amount stated in the buyer agreement. If a potential homeowner is just speaking with an agent and at an open house or asking about services, the buyer does not need a written agreement.</p><p>If the seller agrees to compensate the buyer’s agent, the offer cannot be shared on an MLS. Buyers can still accept concessions from the seller, such as offers to pay closing costs.</p><p>HGAR members may access the new, required agreements beginning Aug. 7, 2024, at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/" rel="noreferrer">hgar.com</a>.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Almost 90% of metro markets (199 out of 223, or 89%) recorded home price gains in the second quarter of 2024, as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.82% to 7.22%, according to the National Association of Realtors' latest quarterly report released on Aug. 13.</p><p>Thirteen percent of the 223 tracked metro areas experienced double-digit price gains over the same period, down from 30% in the first quarter. The median single-family existing-home price for the San Jose, CA metro area was $2,008,000—it's the first time since NAR began tracking metro area single-family home prices in 1979 that a metro area's median price exceeded $2 million.</p><p>Two market areas that make up the New York metro region—New York-Jersey City-White Plains, NY-NJ (No. 7) and Dutchess County-Putnam County, NY (No. 9)—ranked among the top 10 metro areas for price increases in the second quarter.</p><p>“The record-high home prices in most metro markets bring good and bad news,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “It's terrific news for homeowners who are moving ahead in wealth gains. However, it's difficult for those wanting to buy a home as the required income to qualify has roughly doubled from just a few years ago.”</p><p>Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price grew 4.9% to $422,100. In the previous quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 5%.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South registered the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (45.5%) in the second quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 2.3%. Prices also bounced 9.8% in the Northeast, 5.5% in the Midwest and 5.4% in the West.<br><br>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year median price increases, which can be influenced by the types of homes sold during the quarter, all posted gains of at least 14.1%. Five of the markets were in the Northeast. Overall, those markets were Racine, Wis. (19.8%); Glens Falls, NY (19.8%); El Paso, TX (19.2%); Morristown, TN (16.7%); Manchester-Nashua, NH (16.2%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA (15.0%); New York-Jersey City-White Plains, NY-NJ (14.8%); Springfield, IL (14.8%); Dutchess County-Putnam County, NY (14.2%); and Trenton, NJ (14.1%).<br><br>Seven of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Overall, those markets were San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($2,008,000; 11.6%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,449,000; 8.5%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,437,500; 15%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,101,500; 3.8%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($1,050,000; 11.4%); Salinas, CA ($1,035,700; 13.1%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($927,900; 2.5%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($895,300; 0.5%); Boulder, CO ($888,300; 2%); and Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL ($867,000; 2%).<br><br>Nearly 10% of markets (22 of 223) experienced home price declines in the second quarter, up from 7% in the first quarter.<br><br>“Previously fast-gaining markets took a breather in the past quarter, including Nashville, Durham, Austin, and several Florida metro areas,” Yun said. “Conversely, some markets that experienced declines last year have roared back, such as San Francisco, Anaheim, and New York.”<br><br>Housing affordability worsened in the second quarter as mortgage rates increased. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,262, up 11.1% from the first quarter ($2,036) and 10.3%—or $212—from one year ago. Families typically spent 26.5% of their income on mortgage payments, up from 24.2% in the previous quarter and 25.3% one year ago.<br><br>First-time buyers encountered limited inventory and rising home prices in the second quarter, resulting in deteriorated affordability conditions compared to the prior quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $358,800 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment jumped to $2,218, up 11.1% from the previous quarter ($1,997). That was an increase of $207, or 10.3%, from one year ago ($2,011). First-time buyers typically spent 40% of their family income on mortgage payments, up from 36.5% in the prior quarter.<br><br>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down payment mortgage in 48% of markets, up from 40.7% in the previous quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 2.7% of markets, down from 4.5% in the prior quarter.<br><br>“Housing affordability will improve in upcoming months,” Yun said. “Mortgage rates have fallen measurably, and more supply is reaching the market. Therefore, the income required to buy a home will decrease.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/08/Infographic-NAR-Q2-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Infographic-NAR-Q2-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Infographic-NAR-Q2-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/08/Infographic-NAR-Q2-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Realtor.com has seen substantial improvement in inventory in the first half of 2024, climbing by more than 35% on a year-over-year basis. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA, CA—Home price growth and inventory are now predicted to end the year with year-over-year gains, according to the Realtor.com 2024 Forecast Update. For sale inventory is forecasted to see the biggest change as home sellers patiently wait for buyers instead of delisting. Existing home median sales price is forecasted to increase year-over-year despite elevated mortgage rates, rising inventory, and homes sitting on the market longer.</p><p>“During the first half of this year, we have seen home buyers continue to remain sensitive to mortgage rates, and while home sellers are also affected, the binds of the mortgage rate lock-in effect appear to be loosening for some homeowners,” said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. “These trends mean that home sales in 2024 will eke out only a small gain over 2023, but homebuyers have a fair amount to look forward to in the latter part of the year. Mortgage rates have finally begun to ease, and this trend is expected to continue as improving inflation enables the Fed to relax its tight policy, boosting homebuyer purchasing power.”</p><p>She added, “Furthermore, gains in the number of homes for sale mean that buyers have more negotiating power than they have had in recent years which should help buyers and sellers find the middle ground necessary for more sales. Fall has historically been a shoulder season for the housing market that benefits flexible buyers, and this year is setting up to be even more advantageous.”</p><h3 id="lower-rates-finally-arrive">Lower Rates Finally Arrive</h3><p>Earlier this month, mortgage rates dropped to their lowest rate since May 2023 and recent data trends, especially relating to job growth and unemployment are providing evidence that Fed policy is working—perhaps working overtime—and a rate cut, even a large one, may be appropriate. Therefore, Realtor.com’s forecast for mortgage rates has been revised slightly lower. Realtor.com’s yearly mortgage rate average forecast is slightly lower at 6.7%, and it revised its year-end forecast to 6.3% from 6.5%.</p><h3 id="annual-home-sales-rebound-ish">Annual Home Sales Rebound-ish</h3><p>Despite affordability headwinds persisting and mortgage rates hindering buying power, we have revised home sales upwards marginally to 4.1 million—an annual increase of .08%. Although there has been more inventory than expected, high mortgage rates this spring which coincided with the peak of the homebuying season had a dampening effect on home sales. For example, this June's existing home sales dropped to 3.89 million, the lowest level in six months. The arrival of lower mortgage rates will help draw homebuyers back into the housing market, but with a short runway left in 2024 and a sluggish first half to overcome, home sales are unlikely to take off.</p><h3 id="home-sale-prices-continue-to-climb">Home Sale Prices Continue to Climb</h3><p>Despite elevated mortgage rates, rising inventory, and homes sitting on the market longer, sales prices continue to rise. As a result, we've revised our initial forecast of a small price decline of 1.7% in 2024 to a rise of 4.6%. This significant revision reflects a resilient U.S. economy and a housing market that is still more broadly undersupplied despite recent upticks in inventory. What's more, the nation's largest housing markets remain a competitive marketplace and sellers still have the edge, though it has dulled over the past few years with higher rates. Of the 50 largest markets Realtor.com track, only 12 are back to or above their pre-pandemic inventory levels.</p><h3 id="mortgage-lock-in-effect-is-easing-inventory-woes">Mortgage Lock-In Effect is Easing Inventory Woes</h3><p>One of the factors that has hampered home sales—an under-supply of homes for sale—has finally started to ease. Realtor.com has seen substantial improvement in inventory in the first half of 2024, climbing by more than 35% on a year-over-year basis. This is in stark contrast to its initial 2024 forecast that inventory would be down by 14%. Its revised estimate—the largest adjustment in our forecast—is now that inventory will be up 14.5%. The revision reflects two somewhat unanticipated market developments this spring. First, some sellers who postponed their decision to sell last year—hoping that mortgage rates would be lower this spring were spurred to action by the better-than-expected mortgage rates at the start of 2024. Second, sellers who have put their home on the market seem willing to wait for a buyer rather than delisting, leading to longer time on market and inventory accumulating at a higher rate than expected.</p><h3 id="the-nar-settlement-and-election-are-wildcards-but-housing-policy-may-not-be-so-wild">The NAR Settlement and Election are Wildcards, But Housing Policy May Not Be So Wild</h3><p>In the coming months, two major events are noteworthy, though their impact on the housing market could vary. The impact of the NAR commission settlements on the market and home prices are a wildcard and will depend equally on macroeconomic conditions and industry and consumer adaptations, with any changes likely to occur gradually over time. At the same time, Realtor.com doesn’t expect the wildcard election year to be that wild on the economy or housing market in 2024 since both the Republican and Democratic candidates have served in the White House recently. Markets should be able to handle whomever is elected, though acknowledging that the closer the race, the tougher it is to predict the outcome, which can spark volatility.</p><h3 id="rents-remain-largely-steady">Rents Remain Largely Steady</h3><p>Rents have remained largely steady in 2024 as the tug of war between rising multi-family completions boosting rental supply and elevated rental demand has resulted in a nationwide stalemate. Realtor.com sees demand from new households and continuing renters who might like to buy a home but find that today's rent versus buy scales are tipped too far in favor of renting, but rental supply has kept up as builders work through the backlog of multi-family units under construction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In collaboration with the Long Island Board of Realtors, both organizations will be converging on City Hall to speak to our City Council members about our issues. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As if the heat was not bad enough, this political season has done anything but cool off. I do not need to remind you how extreme and stormy the last few weeks have been in politics. From an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump to Vice President Kamala Harris taking the Democratic Nomination for President, I would be remiss to rehash or put my spin on everything that has happened. It's been a whirlwind of political chaos and tension lately, and honestly, if I am this emotionally exhausted, being someone who deals with politics for a living, I can’t imagine what this summer has been like for others.</p><p>That being said, let’s talk about what matters. We live and work in one of the most desirable places to reside in the country. Regardless of who wins in November, people have and will always want to buy and sell property in this region. From the days of New Amsterdam, King George, to today, the real estate market has never stopped because of who happened to be in charge at any given moment. So, let’s do a spot check on some of the public policy movements in our corner of the world.</p><p>For New York City and those who do business there, I am happy to announce that the Government Affairs Department at HGAR will be facilitating the first ever New York City Lobby Day on Oct. 23rd. In collaboration with the Long Island Board of Realtors, both organizations will be converging on City Hall to speak to our City Council members about our issues. </p><p>Like our traditional Lobby Day in Albany, the success of this event depends on member support. It is our hope that given the opportunity of pre-arranged meetings with City Council members and their staff, HGAR and LIBOR members will be able to bring the same level of advocacy and success to New York City that we bring to Albany every year. This is an exercise in civics and is aimed to expand our image in the minds of our City Council members. There will be more details to follow, but please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions.</p><p>Something else that is city-related but has the potential to radiate outward is the “City of Yes” Proposal. This issue proposed by Mayor Eric Adams aims to modernize and update the city’s zoning regulations to support small businesses, create affordable housing and promote sustainability. The City of Yes is currently being discussed with the City Council, with Borough Presidents showing mixed levels of support. The issue is still very much up for debate as the proposal brings all zoning into question in New York City. Namely, one of the specific issues that is a sticking point is the elimination of parking mandates and the possible effect that might have on transportation and traffic. This matters beyond the city as this is a significant effort that brings attention to the topic of zoning in general. If you look at most of the municipalities in New York State, you will find that their zoning laws are decades old if not as old as New York City’s zoning laws. Time will tell how this issue shakes out.</p><p>An example of an issue that radiated from the city is the topic of Good Cause Eviction that is now being discussed throughout the Hudson Valley. You may remember that Good Cause Eviction was passed in the New York State Legislature earlier this year. As a reminder, Good Cause Eviction mandates landlords to extend lease renewal offers to tenants who consistently fulfill their rental obligations and abide by the terms stipulated in their previous lease agreements. Additionally, it empowers renters to contest rent hikes exceeding 10%, or 5% plus the consumer price index, whichever is lower.</p><p>New York City was automatically opted into the program. For the rest of New York State, it has been left up to the municipalities themselves to deal with Good Cause Eviction. Certain exemptions are included in the legislation for NYC, notably a provision allowing owners with 10 or fewer units spread across multiple properties to be exempted from the regulation. This exemption for NYC is not set in stone for municipalities outside of the city. Meaning, a municipality can set the provision from 10 units or fewer to one unit or fewer. Essentially every landlord would be included in Good Cause Eviction. Places like Albany, Newburgh and Rochester have already taken steps in this direction. Again, time will tell how this conversation percolates in each locality. Some areas that seem to be rushing toward adopting Good Cause Eviction are unaware or unwilling to even discuss the topic. Regardless, HGAR and NYSAR are monitoring the budding situation and keeping our members informed.</p><p>In closing, think local. National politics is important. At times it can and should take up all the air in the room. But, we all must realize just how much politics takes from our peace and effectiveness. You can find all the politics and civics you could ever want on a local level. Regardless of whether it is the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning, come November and the months beyond, there will be houses to sell and legislation to push. We will find both victory and challenges to our industry. And, if I have anything to say about it, I plan to be right here, writing, working, and commenting on our own local civic ups and downs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“We should have more inventory. There absolutely should be more inventory than there is right now.”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The national and local real estate markets appear headed for a crossroads. As the Federal Reserve prepares to shift its regulatory position and will likely begin to cut lending rates next month, the industry faces a number of troubling headwinds besides high interest rates, such as: persistent low for-sale inventory, escalating prices impacting affordability and NAR practice changes that took effect on Aug. 17 based on its $418-million commission case settlement to name just a few.</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> contacted five veteran Hudson Valley real estate professionals to get their take on the aforementioned issues and their impact on the housing market in 2024 and beyond. They are: Leah Caro, Broker/Owner and President of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville; Crystal Hawkins-Syska, Associate Broker, Keller Williams NY Realty, White Plains; Gail Fattizzi, Regional Manager, ERA Insite Realty, White Plains; Vlora Sejdi, Associate Broker, HomeSmart Homes &amp; Estates, White Plains and Joseph Rand, Chief Creative Officer of Howard Hanna | Rand Realty.</p><p>In the first installment of the <em>Pulse of the Market</em> series, the <em>Real Estate In-Depth </em>panel was asked about market conditions now and going forward. All agreed that while lower lending rates will be helpful, the key to the market’s recovery is more inventory.</p><p>For background, on Aug. 14, the Labor Department released the latest Consumer Price Index data for July, which showed the CPI rose 2.9%, below analyst expectations. National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun issued a statement sharing his thoughts on rates in reaction to the CPI numbers. “Inflation is calmer, thereby setting the Fed Reserve up to start the rate-cutting process in September. Consumer prices rose by 2.9% in July and look to head towards the desired 2% in a few months. The Fed has indicated the need to normalize and move away from the current ‘restrictive’ monetary policy and its willingness to cut if inflation moves towards 2% rather than waiting to reach 2%. Shelter costs decelerated to 5.0%, still high but clearly trending down as a temporary oversupply of new apartment units will further dent the figures. Auto insurance continues to rocket, up by 19% from a year ago. This does not bode well for property insurance bills.”</p><p>He continued, “Generally, the rate-cutting cycle is not one-and-done. Six to eight rounds of rate cuts all through 2025 look likely. Whoever sits in the White House in 2025 will see lower interest rates. However, a super-sized budget deficit could limit the decline in mortgage rates. More government borrowing means less mortgage money to lend. The new normal for mortgage rates will be around 6% and definitely not to 4% as was before COVID.”</p><h3 id="leah-caro-park-sterling-realty">Leah Caro<br>Park Sterling Realty</h3><p>“Pent-up buyer demand has not been dampened by current interest rates. Some people may have taken themselves out of the market, but I don’t think too many and some people may have had to re-evaluate what they can buy, their spending power as a result. However, the biggest crisis facing the market is the lack of inventory,” she said.<br><br>Caro, who served as president of the Westchester-Putnam Association of Realtors in 2009 and 2010, noted many homeowners that could or perhaps may want to sell, who are currently mortgaged at 2% or 3%, are staying on the sidelines and are unwilling to take on a mortgage of more than 6%. Caro added that until rates come down to levels near their current rate, a good number of these prospective sellers will continue to stay in their homes.<br><br>The longtime Co-Chair of the HGAR Legislative Council related that even after the expected September rate cut, prospective sellers will do the math and then determine if it makes financial sense to list the house. She believes many will continue to stay on the sidelines.<br><br>“I don’t expect (the seller’s market) to change unless something happens to shake up the market so that more inventory comes on,” Caro predicted.</p><h3 id="gail-fattizzi-era-insite-realty">Gail Fattizzi<br>ERA Insite Realty</h3><p>Fattizzi said that interest rates will settle a bit lower in the short term as the Fed gets inflation under control and makes its anticipated cuts. “Will these lower rates increase the number of buyers? Maybe, but the obstacle is still inventory. I don't think that the lower rates will create enough additional listings to meet buyer demand, and those who list in the fall were probably going to do that anyway. So, I don't expect to see a big increase in the number of sales through the end of the year.”<br><br>Fattizzi, the 2020 President of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, noted that in addition to the high rates and low inventory, prospective buyers are also dealing with escalating home prices.<br><br>“While the interest rates are one factor that buyers consider, the other is rising prices. Prices continue to increase. If you are looking at the higher interest rate and you are getting a great house at a reasonable price, it is much more digestible,” Fattizzi said. “Whereas if you are getting a house with what you feel is an inflated price based on conditions and other factors and at a higher interest rate on top of that it is really a deterrent.”<br><br>Fattizzi continued, “So, interest rates coming down helps, but if prices keep escalating and people aren’t feeling they are getting good value for what they are spending for the house, that is going to continue to be an obstacle as well.”</p><h3 id="joseph-rand-howard-hanna-rand-realty">Joseph Rand<br>Howard Hanna | Rand Realty</h3><p>The veteran Realtor who also currently serves as the Mayor of Nyack described the current market as “strange.” Citing some similarities to the 2006-2008 seller’s market, Rand noted that the market 18 years ago was a seller’s market that was expanded by a credit bubble that eventually led to the housing downturn beginning in 2009. Today’s seller’s market features continued strong buying demand, but artificially low inventory levels due to potential sellers staying on the sidelines because of very low mortgage interest rates on their current properties.</p><p>He related that homeowners who would like to downsize or move face a conundrum where they cannot afford to pay a new mortgage of approximately 7% when their current mortgage rate at their existing home is between 3% to 4%.<br><br>Homeowners are saying: “I can’t afford to sell. I can’t move. They would like to downsize, but they can’t downsize because if they downsize their monthly payment is going to be the same at the new house, so why don’t I just keep the house that I am in,” Rand said.<br><br>He added, “We should have more inventory. There absolutely should be more inventory than there is right now.” In addition to low inventory, buyers have become increasingly skeptical of rising home values and are not willing to meet sellers at times lofty home price demands.<br><br>He said home sales volume is now down to where it was back in 2010. However, 14 years ago that down market was caused by low demand. Home values are currently at record highs in all of the markets in the three states that Howard Hanna | Rand Realty serves and home sales are at record lows in all those markets as well. While demand is lower than a year ago, there are enough buyers in the market to cause home prices to continue to rise.<br><br>Rand said that inventories are starting to rise as interest rates fall. He believes the “sweet spot” where property owners who have low-interest rate mortgages will seriously consider and perhaps put their homes on the market for sale will be below 6%. “We get interest rates below 6%, people will relax a little bit… and feel a little better.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/08/The-Pulse-of-the-market1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1452" height="1065" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/The-Pulse-of-the-market1.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/The-Pulse-of-the-market1.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/08/The-Pulse-of-the-market1.png 1452w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="vlora-sejdi-homesmart">Vlora Sejdi<br>HomeSmart</h3><p>Sejdi, who is President-Elect of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, said there continues to be a “tremendous amount of demand” and little supply of homes on the market.<br><br>“There is fatigue for buyers,” she said. “It’s been a rough two years. … There has been a lot of disappointment.

She said the seller’s market is particularly difficult on first-time buyers and added that “it is very hard for any FHA or VA buyer to even compete… Essentially those that must purchase are driving the market up in a way that seems unprecedented.”</p><p>Because the current market is so competitive, agents don’t have time for “tire kickers or window shoppers.” Inventory is low in all price points.</p><p>However, what she has noticed is that “Location matters. If you go to certain places more north, there is more inventory, but there is still high demand,” Syska related.</p><p>She believes that most homeowners will resist putting their homes on the market until rates hit 4% or lower. However, with the prospect of lower rates, she believes that while inventory will improve marginally, the buyer pool will increase with more people being able to secure financing. This scenario, she says, will likely cause home prices to continue to increase going forward.</p><p>“In many markets, where you are going to see the shift in inventory in any kind of major way is really going to be after November, after the election,” Syska said. “That is when I think we are going to see some movement in a way that is different because I think people are a little more concerned about who takes office and what that means to their bottom line.”</p><p>She added: “If the cost of living doesn’t come down dramatically, a lot of people are still going to hold in place.”</p><p>From September to November, she predicts that there will be buyers and sellers “panic” where they have to buy or sell quickly, which is going to keep the market in the current “sellers’ bubble.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales improved in July, breaking a streak of four consecutive monthly declines, according to the National Association of Realtors. Three out of four major U.S. regions registered sales increases while the Midwest remained steady. Year-over-year, sales rose in the Northeast and West, but retreated in the Midwest and South.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—ascended 1.3% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95 million in July. Year-over-year, sales fell 2.5% (down from 4.05 million in July 2023).</p><p>“Despite the modest gain, home sales are still sluggish,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “But consumers are definitely seeing more choices, and affordability is improving due to lower interest rates.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of July was 1.33 million units, up 0.8% from June and 19.8% from one year ago (1.11 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 4.0-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 4.1 months in June, but up from 3.3 months in July 2023.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in July was $422,600, up 4.2% from one year ago ($405,600). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 24 days in July, up from 22 days in June and 20 days in July 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 29% of sales in July, identical to June but down from 30% in July 2023. NAR’s 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.</p><p>All-cash sales accounted for 27% of transactions in July, down from 28% in June but up from 26% one year ago.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 13% of homes in July, down from 16% in both June 2024 and July 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 1% of sales in July, virtually unchanged from last month and the prior year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates">Mortgage Rates</h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.49% as of August 15. That’s up from 6.47% one week ago, but down from 7.09% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales">Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</h3><p>Single-family home sales grew 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.57 million in July, down 1.4% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $428,500 in July, up 4.2% from July 2023.</p><p>Existing condominium and co-op sales in July were identical to June at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 380,000 units, down 11.6% from one year ago (430,000 units). The median existing condo price was $367,500 in July, up 2.7% from the prior year ($357,900).</p><p>“The median home price of condominiums is cheaper, yet the condominium market is underperforming compared to the single-family market,” Yun added. “Rising maintenance and insurance costs have lessened the appeal for condominiums.”</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown">Regional Breakdown</h3><p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast in July climbed 4.3% from June to an annual rate of 490,000, an increase of 2.1% from July 2023. The median price in the Northeast was $505,100, up 8.3% from last year.</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales were unchanged in July at an annual rate of 920,000, down 5.2% from the previous year.

The median price in the South was $372,500, up 2.3% from one year earlier.</p><p>In the West, existing-home sales rose 1.4% in July to an annual rate of 750,000, also up 1.4% from a year ago.

    <description><![CDATA[The TOD deed is non-testamentary, which means that the interest in the real property transfers automatically to the designated beneficiary named in the TOD deed by operation of law and no probate or administration proceeding is required.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Effective as of July 19, 2024, newly enacted Real Property Law (“RPL”) Section 424 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4dojqrQ">https://bit.ly/4dojqrQ</a>] now allows for property owners to execute a transfer on death deed designating one or more beneficiaries to receive the real property upon an owner’s death. New York State has followed a number of other states that allow for this new form of real property transfer. It is important for real estate professionals to be aware of this new legislation as it relates to how real property can now be disposed of in the event of an individual’s death.</p><h3 id="a-new-estate-planning-mechanism-transfer-on-death-deeds">A New Estate Planning Mechanism: Transfer on Death Deeds</h3><p>Before the enactment of RPL Section 424, there were very limited alternatives for property owners to effectuate a transfer of real property at death. Customarily, one would either have to execute a life estate deed, where the interest in the property would be transferred to one or more beneficiaries outright, subject to a retained life estate, but without the right or ability to take the property back. Alternatively, one could set up a revocable trust and transfer the property to the trust, which is usually not inexpensive, but would allow for added flexibility relating to the disposition of real property should one change one’s mind (as opposed to a life estate deed), or the property would become part of a Surrogate’s Court probate proceeding if there was a will, or an administration proceeding through the Surrogate’s Court if the owner did not have a will.</p><p>RPL Section 424 now allows an owner or joint owners of real property to be able to designate one or more beneficiaries to receive the real property upon the death of the last joint owner, similar to designating a beneficiary on a bank account. The TOD deed allows for individuals to designate one or more beneficiaries to receive real property without having to execute a will or trust, or execute a life estate deed. Additionally, the TOD deed is not only limited to individuals, but may be utilized by any “…association, board, corporation, whether municipal, stock or non-stock, court, governmental agency, authority or subdivision, partnership or other firm and the state.”</p><p>While the TOD deed is a cost-effective method of having real property transfer to one or more beneficiaries without having to incur the cost or expense of commencing a probate or administration proceeding, it is important for real estate professionals to recommend to clients that they seek legal counsel before choosing the TOD deed option, as there are many other issues (e.g., estate planning, tax, etc.) that may need to be considered.</p><h3 id="requirements-and-formalities-of-a-tod-deed">Requirements and Formalities of a TOD Deed</h3><p>The TOD deed is non-testamentary, which means that the interest in the real property transfers automatically to the designated beneficiary named in the TOD deed by operation of law and no probate or administration proceeding is required. An individual executing a TOD deed must have the same legal capacity required as when executing a will.</p><p>The TOD deed must also meet the following requirements: (1) it must contain all of the “essential elements and formalities of a properly recordable inter vivos deed”, (2) it must state that the transfer to the named beneficiary (ies) shall occur on the death of the transferor(s), (3) it must be signed by two witnesses, (4) it must be acknowledged before a notary public, and (5) it must be recorded prior to the transferor’s death in the county clerk’s office where the property is located. The form of the TOD deed is contained in Subsection 15 of Section 424 of the RPL. A TOD deed will also require that the usual transfer tax forms be prepared in order for it to be recorded.</p><h3 id="revocation-of-a-tod-deed">Revocation of a TOD Deed</h3><p>A TOD deed may be revoked only by one of the following written instruments in accordance with Section 424, subsection 9(a)(1):</p><p><em>“(A) a transfer on death deed that revokes the deed or part of the deed expressly or by inconsistency;</em></p><p><em>(B) an instrument of revocation that expressly revokes the deed or part of the deed; or</em></p><p><em>(C) an inter vivos deed that expressly revokes the transfer on death deed or part of the deed; and<br><br>(2) is acknowledged by the transferor after the acknowledgment of the deed being revoked and recorded before the transferor's death in the public records in the county clerk's office of the county where the deed is recorded.”</em><br><br>Further, if a TOD deed is made by more than one transferor, subsection 9(a)(2) provides that a revocation by one transferor shall not affect the deed as to another transferor and the deed of joint owners may only be revoked by all living joint owners. The form of revocation is found in Subsection 16 of Section 424. The form of revocation would also need to be recorded with the county clerk’s office.<br><br>What are the Effects of a TOD Deed During the Transferor’s Life?<br><br>According to RPL Section 424, subsection 10, a TOD deed does not affect an owner’s right to any interest in the property or any right to encumber the property. It also does not affect any right or interest of a transferee or any secured or unsecured creditors, whether or not they had actual or constructive notice of the TOD deed.<br><br>The TOD deed does not affect the transferor’s or designated beneficiary’s eligibility for any form of public assistance. Additionally, a designated beneficiary does not acquire any legal or equitable interest in the property prior to the owner(s) death, nor does it subject the real property to any claims of a creditor of any beneficiary designated in the TOD deed.</p><h3 id="what-happens-upon-the-death-of-the-transferor">What Happens Upon the Death of the Transferor?</h3><p>Upon the death of the last surviving joint tenant, the real property transfers automatically to the named beneficiary(ies) in accordance with the provisions of the TOD deed. If a named beneficiary predeceases the owner, then the interest of the beneficiary lapses (i.e., terminates) and is of no further force or effect. However, if there are two or more named beneficiaries designated to receive concurrent interests in the property, then the interest in the property will transfer to the remaining beneficiaries in equal undivided shares with no right of survivorship.</p><p>Additionally, under subsection 11(a)(4), “If the transferor has identified two or more designated beneficiaries to receive concurrent interests in the property, the share of one which lapses or fails for any reason shall be transferred to the other, or to the others in proportion to the interest of each in the remaining part of the property held concurrently.” Upon the death of the transferor, or the last surviving joint owner, the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries immediately take title to the property subject to “…all conveyances, encumbrances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, liens, and other interests to which the property is subject at the transferor's death.” Therefore, for example, if there is a mortgage or other lien on the property, the beneficiary would be taking title to the property subject to any such lien, mortgage or other encumbrance.</p><h3 id="what-happens-when-there-are-joint-owners">What Happens When There are Joint Owners?</h3><p>Subsection 11(c) provides that “If a transferor is a joint owner and is survived by one or more other joint owners, the property that is the subject of a transfer on death deed shall belong to the surviving joint owner or owners with right of survivorship.” Further, in accordance with subsection 11(d), upon the death of the last surviving joint owner, the TOD deed is immediately effective and the property transfers to the named beneficiary(ies) automatically. However, it is important to note that the TOD deed transfers the property to the named beneficiary without any covenant or warranty, even if the deed provides to the contrary. Notwithstanding the fact that the property automatically transfers to the designated beneficiary(ies), any such beneficiary(ies) retain(s) the right to renounce all or part of the interest in the same manner as if were transferred by a will.</p><h3 id="liability-for-claims-of-creditors-or-other-statutory-allowances-of-a-transferor%E2%80%99s-estate">Liability for Claims of Creditors or<br>Other Statutory Allowances of a Transferor’s Estate</h3><p>In the event there exist any claims against the estate of a transferor or there are any statutory allowances to a surviving spouse or child, subsection 14(a) provides that ‘the estate may enforce the liability against property transferred at the transferor's death by a transfer on death deed.” Further, in accordance with subsection 14(b), if there is more than one property transferred by multiple TOD deeds, then any liability of the estate of the transferor would be “apportioned among the properties in proportion to their net values at the transferor's death.” Any proceeding to enforce the liability under Subsection 14 must be commenced no later than 18 months after the transferor's death.</p><h3 id="the-tod-deed-a-new-and-exciting-option-but-it-may-not-be-for-everyone">The TOD Deed: A New and Exciting Option,<br>But It May Not Be For Everyone</h3><p>The TOD deed does provide individuals with a new way to dispose of real property upon death by way of beneficiary designation, however, it is important to note that there may be complex estate planning and tax issues that need to be reviewed with legal and tax professionals. For individuals whose estate consists of limited assets (e.g., one or two parcels of real property and a few bank accounts), the TOD deed may be a simple and cost-effective option. However, for individuals who have significant assets and require advanced estate planning, the TOD deed may or may not be an option. The advice of an attorney, accountant and financial adviser should be sought prior to utilizing and recording a TOD deed.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

However, the July 2024 median declined $60,000 from last month’s median of $590,000. Sales of condos escalated by 60%, but the median price declined by 2.2% over last July to $355,000.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—OneKey MLS reported significant trends in July 2024 that bode well for the Hudson Valley and New York metro region’s housing market.</p><p>In July, the regional single-family closed median sale price was $718,750, marking an 8.9% year-over-year increase from $660,000 in July 2023. Condominiums also saw an uptick, with a closed median sale price of $480,000, reflecting a 3.9% increase from $462,000 the previous year. The closed median sale price for co-ops rose to $279,750, a modest 1.5% increase from $275,500 in July 2023.</p><p>When looking at transaction volumes, closed sales for single-family homes and condominiums were both up compared to last year, while co-op sales saw a decline. There were 3,625 single-family closed transactions in July 2024, a 4.4% increase over July 2023. Condominium closed sales reached 533, up by 6.8%, while co-op closed sales dropped by 6.4% to 528.</p><p>Inventory continues to play a crucial role in the real estate market, influencing prices, buyer demand, and the pace of sales. In July 2024, new listings for single-family homes rose compared to the same time last year, with 4,634 new listings versus 4,424 in July 2023. Conversely, new listings for condos and co-ops decreased, with 773 condo listings (down 14.4%) and 819 co-op listings (down 16.8%) compared to the previous year.</p><p>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, commented on the current market dynamics, stating, “The rise in median sale prices reflects strong demand, particularly in the single-family home segment, despite fluctuations in inventory levels. As we look ahead, the potential for declining mortgage rates could reignite buyer enthusiasm, especially for those who have been on the fence due to higher borrowing costs. A decrease in rates could bring more buyers back into the market, stimulating activity across various property types.”</p><p>OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York, aggregates the real estate transactional data from 12 counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

    <description><![CDATA[The fair housing complaint stems from a WRO investigation and subsequent complaint filed with DHR in 2021.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—The New York State Division of Human Rights filed a fair housing discrimination lawsuit in Bronx Supreme Court on Aug. 26 against Dawn Homes Management based on a complaint filed three years earlier by White Plains-based Westchester Residential Opportunities, Inc.</p><p>The fair housing complaint stems from a WRO investigation and subsequent complaint filed with DHR in 2021 that alleged Dawn Homes Management, which is headquartered in Albany, illegally discriminated on the basis of lawful source of income against individuals using housing vouchers or other rental subsidies who sought rental housing at Dawn Homes Management properties in the Hudson Valley and upstate New York.</p><p>The Division of Human Rights charged that Dawn Homes Management “engaged in discrimination based upon source of income by refusing to accept rental vouchers directly from prospective tenants, and requiring that all prospective tenants meet minimum income requirements,” according to court documents.</p><p>Dawn Homes operates apartment complexes in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, with more than 30 sites in upstate New York. WRO’s complaint was based on a multi-year testing investigation conducted by WRO of seven of Dawn Homes’ New York apartment complexes— Chelsea Ridge Apartments Wappingers Falls (Dutchess County); Village Park Apartments, Pleasant Valley (Dutchess County); Netherlands Village Apartments, Schenectady (Schenectady County); Glenmont Manor Apartments, Glenmont, (Albany County); Loudon Arms Apartments, Albany (Albany County); Maple Manor, Delmar (Albany County) and Mill Creek Apartments, East Greenbush (Rensselaer County).</p><p>Between August 2019 and May 2021, WRO “Testers” called Dawn Homes leasing agents at the seven aforementioned complexes in New York. WRO alleged that Dawn Homes applied a minimum income requirement at its New York apartment complexes that excluded virtually all applicants with rental subsidies. After WRO filed a complaint with NYS DHR, DHR undertook its own investigation of WRO’s allegations and Dawn Homes’ defenses, culminating in July 2023 in the DHR’s finding of “probable cause” in favor of WRO’s claims.</p><p>WRO’s Executive Director Marlene Zarfes thanked the NYS DHR investigators and attorneys for what she described as their careful and thorough investigation of WRO’s allegations and stated that “WRO expects to intervene in this lawsuit to pursue our claims alongside DHR and we look forward to making our case before the court.”<br><br>In its complaint filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights back in August 2021, WRO alleged that during the investigation, “when Dawn Homes’ agents were told by WRO’s testers (posing as prospective tenants) that they would be renting using housing vouchers, the agents told the testers various things, including that Dawn Homes:</p><ul>
<li>Did not accept any rental vouchers or participate in any “programs”;</li>
<li>Did accept vouchers but only if the applicant met a minimum income requirement of three times the total rent;</li>
<li>Sometimes the agent said the voucher amount was included as income in that calculation, sometimes it was not; in either case, the income requirement was based on the full amount of the rent, even if the rental voucher would pay most or all of the monthly rent;</li>
<li>Could not rent to them, but steered them to other buildings in the area not operated by Dawn Homes; and</li>
<li>Will not sign contracts with third parties to pay the rent, including rental subsidy programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These responses violate the letter and spirit of New York’s source of income protections, and exclude households relying on housing vouchers from housing opportunities that should be available to them.”</p><p>WRO’s Executive Director Marlene Zarfes stated when filing the complaint three years ago: “Source of income discrimination has been illegal in New York State since April 2019. New York’s Division of Human Rights has made it clear that housing providers may not have policies that have the effect of excluding holders of housing vouchers (like onerous multiples of rent income requirements), even if the policies look neutral on their face. The law also prohibits housing providers from refusing to work with voucher programs because of their administrative requirements, like apartment inspections or contractual terms required by the program administrator. Otherwise, the source of income law would be rendered meaningless.”</p><p>In a prepared statement sent to <em>Real Estate In-Dep</em>th, Naomi Storch, Vice President of Operations and Investor Relations at Dawn Homes Management, stated: “Dawn Homes Management respectfully denies any allegations of unlawful conduct and will decline further comment until the litigation is concluded.”</p><p>WRO is represented in this matter by Diane L. Houk of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward &amp; Maazel, LLP.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in July retreated 5.5%, according to data released earlier today by the National Association of Realtors. All four U.S. regions posted monthly losses in transactions. Year-over-year, the Northeast rose, while the Midwest, South and West registered pending sales declines.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—slipped to 70.2 in July, the lowest reading since the index began tracking in 2001. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 8.5%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.&nbsp;</p><p>“A sales recovery did not occur in midsummer,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The positive impact of job growth and higher inventory could not overcome affordability challenges and some degree of wait-and-see related to the upcoming U.S. presidential election.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Northeast PHSI waned 1.4% from last month to 64.6, an increase of 2.4% from July 2023. The Midwest index reduced 7.8% to 67.8 in July, down 11.4% from one year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The South PHSI sank 6.5% to 83.5 in July, falling 11.5% from the prior year. The West index shrunk 3.8% in July to 56.2, down 6.0% from July 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>“In terms of home sales and prices, the New England region has performed relatively better than other regions in recent months,” added Yun. “Current lower, falling mortgage rates will no doubt bring buyers into market.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The opinion permits Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents if the seller has agreed to Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency and/or Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents by indicating the same and signing the agency disclosure form.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Earlier today, the New York State Association of Realtors emailed its members a Legal Update in regards to an opinion rendered by the New York State Department of State that addressed a request from NYSAR on the legality of Dual Agency and Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents in certain scenarios such as at an open house.</p><p>The following is the complete text of NYSAR’s Legal Update:</p><p>Dear NYSAR member,</p><p>On Aug. 27, 2024, the Department of State responded to NYSAR’s request for a legal opinion addressing the legality of Dual Agency and Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents in certain scenarios such as at an open house. The opinion was requested by NYSAR because the wording of DOS Legal Memorandum LI12 “Be Wary of Dual Agency” and the absence of any other opinion or guidance about the various ways in which Dual or Designated Agency may occur was confusing to our members.</p><h3 id="history">HISTORY</h3><p>DOS Legal Memorandum LI12 “Be Wary of Dual Agency” discussed how dual agency may occur. It should be noted that Legal Memorandum LI12 was published prior to Dual Agent with Designated Sales Agent being added to the agency disclosure law in 2007 and Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency and Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents being added to the agency disclosure law in 2011. Legal Memorandum LI12 stated that dual agency occurs when “A real estate broker employs two salespeople, one who works for the buyer as a buyer's agent and the other who works for the seller as a seller's agent. The real estate broker and his salespeople are ‘one and the same’ entity when analyzing whether dual agency exists. As soon as the buyer's agent introduces the buyer to property in which the seller is represented by the seller's agent, dual agency arises."<br><br>LI12 did not provide an opinion as to whether Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents could occur if an unrepresented buyer communicated with the listing agent or another licensee associated with the listing broker about a property currently listed by the brokerage. This communication could occur with an associated licensee of the listing broker at an open house or through telephone, email etc. NYSAR advocated for Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents to be permissible in such scenarios. The new DOS opinion clarifies how Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents can occur in such a scenario.</p><h3 id="new-dos-opinion">NEW DOS OPINION</h3><p>NYSAR requested an opinion from the DOS to clarify other ways in which a Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents may be created with an unrepresented buyer that shows interest in a property listed by the brokerage. In the request, NYSAR specifically cites LI12 and the limited guidance it provided: “The example in LI12 indicates that the buyer agency relationship must have existed prior to the buyer showing interest in the property listed by the same broker in order for dual agency to arise. LI12 does not address other scenarios where dual agency may arise, such as at an open house or if an unrepresented buyer contacts a licensee of the listing brokerage to view the property listed by that broker. Furthermore, LI12 was published prior to advanced informed consent to dual agency and advanced informed consent to dual agency with designated sales agents and does not take that into consideration."<br><br>In the opinion, DOS expanded on the scenarios under which Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents may be created with an unrepresented buyer. The opinion permits Dual Agency or Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents if the seller has agreed to Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency and/or Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents by indicating the same and signing the agency disclosure form. Furthermore, the seller must fully understand (informed consent) that the listing agent or any licensee associated with the listing brokerage, while said licensee is acting as a seller’s agent, can solicit an unrepresented buyer to enter into a buyer’s agency relationship and then immediately enter into either Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency or Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents.<br><br>Pursuant to the opinion and following the requirement for informed consent set forth above, the following scenarios have been deemed permissible by the DOS:</p><ol>
<li>Listing agent or licensee associated with the listing broker is holding an open house and an unrepresented buyer attends. The listing agent or other associated licensee with the listing broker may enter into a buyer’s agency relationship with the buyer followed immediately by Dual Agency (can be a single licensee or two licensees) or Designated Agency (must be two licensees).</li>
<li>Listing agent or licensee associated with the listing broker is contacted by an unrepresented buyer that shows interest in a property listed by the brokerage. The listing agent or other associated licensee with the listing broker may enter into a buyer’s agency relationship with the buyer followed immediately by Dual Agency (can be a single licensee or two licensees) or Designated Agency (must be two licensees).</li>
<li>In the scenarios listed above, the unrepresented buyer may also be referred to another associated licensee within the brokerage to act as a Dual Agent or Designated Agent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The DOS also included some additional language to further clarify the responsibilities of a licensee as it applies to the law that authorized Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency and Advanced Informed Consent to Designated Agents:<br><br>Two disadvantages of advanced consent to dual agency, however, are the likely increase of disciplinary complaints against licensees and a less informed public. In the event that an agency relationship changes from the broker representing one party, to representing both, the consumers may not know who the broker is actually representing. The bill is clear that advance consent to dual agency must be “informed.” As such, the Department is of the opinion that the bill would require real estate licensees to disclose the benefits and detriments of providing advance consent prior to the form being executed and to provide later disclosure when the dual agency relationship has actually been consummated. Not providing this follow-up disclosure would be a violation of the broker's fiduciary duties of full disclosure and reasonable care to the consumer and would be a demonstration of untrustworthiness pursuant to section 441-c of the Real Property Law.<br><br>The opinion further states:</p><p><em>The above concerns remain relevant to your inquiry to the extent that it relates to what information the licensee relays to the parties involved and whether when providing such information, the agent acted in good faith to obtain such consent. See generally, Restatement (Third) Of Agency § 8.06 (2006)1. The issue in determining whether there are grounds to commence disciplinary action, depends on what the licensee, already in an advanced consent dual agency relationship, discloses to the second party (i.e., the unrepresented party), to obtain consent for mutual representation and divided loyalties. For example, but by no means exhaustive, if the listing agent suggests or implies that by establishing a “buyer’s” advanced dual agency it will provide an advantage over an unrepresented party because the agent can disclose confidential information in a dual agency (or does disclose confidential information to secure the dual agency consent), the same is likely a breach of the aforesaid obligations. Accordingly, whether the situations you have described are lawful requires a searching of the individual facts and circumstances of the agency formation and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>It is important, however, to observe that while it might be permissible, if not properly formulated a licensee could be disciplined by the Department and/or be required to forfeit the right to a commission. See generally, P. Zaccaro, Co. v DHA Capital, LLC, 70 N.Y.S.3d 458, 460, 2018 N.Y. Slip Op. 00458, 2018 WL 542243 (N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept., Jan. 25, 2018)(“Where, as here, the duty of undivided loyalty is breached, plaintiff broker forfeits its right to a commission, regardless of whether damages were incurred.”)(internal citations omitted).</em><br><br>In response to the DOS opinion, NYSAR has amended the “Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency” and the “Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents” disclosure forms that are available here: <a href="https://www.nysar.com/legal/forms">https://www.nysar.com/legal/forms</a><br><br>The forms help licensees explain what dual and designated agency are as well as what a licensee is permitted and prohibited from doing when acting as the same. The amendments include a clear and conspicuous disclosure to the seller that the listing agent or any licensee associated with the listing broker may solicit an unrepresented buyer that has shown interest in a property listed by the brokerage and act as a buyer’s agent for that buyer and then immediately enter into a Dual Agent or Dual Agent with Designated Sales Agent relationship. Although the NYSAR disclosures contain such language, licensees should still explain how dual or designated agency may arise. The mere signing of the agency disclosure form or the NYSAR “Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency” or the “Advanced Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents” does not rise to the level of “informed consent”. In other words, the consumer must clearly understand under what scenarios licensees of the listing broker may act as a dual or designated agent.<br><br>In filling out the New York State Agency Disclosure Form for Buyer and Seller with a buyer in one of the above two scenarios, the licensee should first have the buyer acknowledge buyer’s agency. The form should be checked off on the right side of the top of the form in the brackets stating “Buyer as a” and “Buyer’s agent.” The buyer can then check off “Advance Informed Consent Dual Agency” and/or “Advance Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents.” If “Advance Informed Consent to Dual Agency with Designated Sales Agents” is checked off, the names of the designated agents should be written in the paragraph that is above the acknowledgement and signature portion at the bottom of the form.<br><br>NYSAR members with questions may contact NYSAR’s Legal Hotline. The Legal Hotline is available Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:00pm at 518-436-9727.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BRONX—Approximately 90 members gathered at the Castle Hill YMCA to participate in the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Third Annual Bronx County Day held on Sept. 12. The program featured the latest association news, along with legislative initiatives and needs put forth by New York State political leaders.</p><p>A lively economic development session followed that highlighted some of the major projects planned for the Bronx in the coming years. The program concluded with a Legal Update that focused on the National Association of Realtors commission settlement and its impact on the real estate industry by John Dolgetta, Esq., principal of Dolgetta Law, PLLC of White Plains.</p><p>The program began with a welcome address by Joseph Cosentino, Regional Director and Chapter Representative Bronx for HGAR. Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson welcomed HGAR to the borough and spoke of the progress made in the Bronx and the work that needs to be done to improve the quality of life in the borough. Lynda Fernandez, RCE, CAE, the Chief Executive Officer of HGAR, provided an update on association initiatives as well as the latest data on the Bronx housing market.</p><p>One of the highlights of Bronx County Day was a comprehensive look at the economic development climate in the borough. Rob Walsh, president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, listed a host of projects planned or under construction that will provide jobs and investment, including the Hip-Hop Museum and the Bronx Logistics Center to name just a few.</p><p>However, Walsh and former Bronx Borough President Reuben Diaz Jr. described the recent approval by the New York City Council of the rezoning of the East Bronx as a “monumental step forward” and a “game changer” for the Bronx.</p><p>Last month, the New York City Council approved the Bronx Metro-North Station Area Study rezoning proposal with modifications. The rezoning will pave the way for the development of thousands of units of new affordable housing and invest in neighborhood infrastructure improvements surrounding new Metro-North train stations to be built in the Bronx as part of the more than $3-billion Penn Station Access Project, which is currently under construction.<br><br>The rezoning will help create approximately 7,000 new units of housing in and around the four new MTA stations to be developed— Hunts Point, Parkchester/Van Nest, Morris Park, and Co-Op City, which will connect commuters in the East Bronx directly to Manhattan’s Penn Station once completed.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/09/BRONX-BOROUGH-PRESIDENT-PIC.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/BRONX-BOROUGH-PRESIDENT-PIC.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/09/BRONX-BOROUGH-PRESIDENT-PIC.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/09/BRONX-BOROUGH-PRESIDENT-PIC.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/09/BRONX-BOROUGH-PRESIDENT-PIC.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson welcomed the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors to the Bronx.ThirdTTT</span></figcaption></figure><p>The New York City Council announced that in connection with the committee’s approval of the rezoning plan, the council successfully negotiated commitments from the Adams administration to invest $498.5 million for improvements to the surrounding neighborhoods.</p><p>Diaz, who now serves as the Senior Vice President, Strategic Initiatives, Montefiore Einstein, told Real Estate In-Depth that the rezoning will allow Montefiore to consolidate its campuses as well as expand its cancer and life sciences sections and dormitory facilities.</p><p>He said the rezoning and Penn Access project “will be a way for us to reimagine the whole area. We are going to end up being the paradigm of health care.”</p><p>The former Borough President, who lamented that the Covid pandemic robbed the Bronx of its economic momentum, said the rezoning will foster significant housing and office development in the East Bronx.<br><br>“Montefiore-Einstein specifically, we are going to be (developing) what I call a ‘wellness village.’ We are going to be what tech is in the Silicon Valley, that’s what we are going to be for health care.”<br><br>He estimated that 30% of the land affected by the rezoning is owned or controlled by Montefiore-Einstein.<br><br>“We are going to need more FAR (Floor Area Ratio) so that we can create a Cancer Center, a High Acuity Service Tower and more dorms."<br><br>He said that there is a potential for Montefiore-Einstein alone to build approximately 1.8 million square feet of new development in the East Bronx thanks to the rezoning approval.<br><br>The Economic Development Session also featured some of the movers and shakers in the Bronx including: Lisa Sorin, President, Bronx Chamber of Commerce; David Simone, President, Company Broker, Concourse Realty and Rafael Roger, President, The Business Initiative Corporation of New York. Kathy Zamechansky, Owner and President of KZA Realty Group was the moderator of the panel.<br><br>A highly informative Legislative Session featured moderators Matthew Engel, President, Langsam Property Services and Sandra Erickson, President, Sandra Erickson Real Estate.

    <description><![CDATA[In terms of transaction volumes, closed sales for single-family homes, condominiums, and co-ops were all down 8.7% regionwide from last year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY—OneKey MLS reported that while home prices continued to increase in most of the region, sales continued to be lower as buyers navigate a changing market. Among key data points identified in the report was that the median single-family home price in Westchester County shot up 14.3% in August from a year earlier to $1,118,000.<br><br>In August, the regional single-family closed median sale price was $725,000, marking an 8.4% year-over-year increase from $669,000 in August 2023. Condominiums also saw an uptick, with a closed median sale price of $519,000, reflecting a significant increase of 11.6% from $465,000 the previous year. The closed median sale price for co-ops rose to $295,000, a 5.4% increase from $280,000 in August 2023.<br><br>In terms of transaction volumes, closed sales for single-family homes, condominiums, and co-ops were all down 8.7% regionwide from last year. There were 3,889 single-family closed transactions in August 2024, a 6.5% decrease from August 2023. Condominium closed sales were 581 and co-op sales were 528, a 4.6% and 20.7% year-over-year decline respectively.<br><br>New listings for single-family homes regionwide were down 1/8%, while inventory of homes for sale fell 7.2% % as compared to August 2023. The OneKey MLS’ market area includes: Sullivan, Putnam, Orange, Rockland, Westchester and the Bronx, as well as Dutchess, Ulster, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties.<br><br>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, commented on the current market conditions, stating, “The real estate market continues to show strength in pricing, with year-over-year increases across single-family homes, condos, and co-ops. However, the lower number of closed transactions in August reflects the ongoing inventory shortage and unpredictable interest rates, which are creating a more competitive and selective market for sellers. This dynamic has led to fewer but higher-value transactions.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/09/OneKey-MLS-Regional-Home-Sales-August-2024-Month-over-Month-Comparisons.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/OneKey-MLS-Regional-Home-Sales-August-2024-Month-over-Month-Comparisons.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/09/OneKey-MLS-Regional-Home-Sales-August-2024-Month-over-Month-Comparisons.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/09/OneKey-MLS-Regional-Home-Sales-August-2024-Month-over-Month-Comparisons.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/09/OneKey-MLS-Regional-Home-Sales-August-2024-Month-over-Month-Comparisons.png 2111w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="market-snapshot-hgar-market-area">Market Snapshot: HGAR Market Area</h2><h3 id="bronx-county"><br>Bronx County</h3><p>In August, closed single-family home sales were down in The Bronx by 18.5%, while new listings fell 1.3%.

    <description><![CDATA[It is important for brokers and agents to note that where a similar form has been made available by both HGAR and NYSAR, those forms do contain varying provisions. Every broker must carefully review each form, and ultimately determine which they would like to utilize.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Aug. 17, 2024, new and extensive changes were introduced into the real estate industry. These changes arose from the settlement entered into in connection with the Sitzer | Burnett class action lawsuit [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3z9ioBj">https://bit.ly/3z9ioBj</a>] filed against the National Association of Realtors and other defendants alleging that NAR had implemented anticompetitive rules and practices that require home sellers to pay commissions to the home buyer’s broker.</p><h3 id="the-nar-settlement">The NAR Settlement</h3><p>On March 15, 2024, NAR proposed a settlement that would end the Sitzer | Burnett action. The settlement would apply to all other similar claims and put an end to the pending, as well as any future, litigation. As part of the settlement, NAR agreed to pay $418 million over four years and would not be required to admit any wrongdoing. NAR has “maintained—and [NAR] continue[s] to believe—that cooperative compensation and NAR’s current policies are good things that benefit buyers and sellers. They promote access to property ownership, particularly for lower- and middle-income buyers who can have a difficult-enough time saving for a down payment.” [<u>See</u> <em>NAR Settlement FAQs</em> (“NAR FAQs”) at <a href="https://bit.ly/3XLgnop">https://bit.ly/3XLgnop</a>]. A preliminary hearing to approve the final settlement is scheduled for Nov. 26, 2024.</p><h3 id="the-effects-of-two-major-changes-under-the-settlement">The Effects of Two Major Changes Under the Settlement</h3><p>Two major practice and rule changes under the settlement went into effect on Aug. 17, 2024. As detailed in the NAR FAQs, two of the key requirements under the settlement include: (1) the prohibition of offers of cooperating compensation being made on the Multiple Listing Service; and (2) the requirement that brokers enter into written agreements with buyers outlining the scope of services being offered and the specific compensation required to be paid. These new requirements have necessitated global changes in the forms that real estate brokers and agents currently utilize, as well as the implementation of new forms to address the various options relating to the payment of compensation to cooperating brokers.</p><h3 id="no-offers-of-cooperating-compensation-on-the-mls-or-facilitated-through-the-mls">No Offers of Cooperating Compensation<br>On the MLS or Facilitated Through the MLS</h3><p>The first change requires that <u>no</u> offers of compensation are to be made on the MLS or facilitated by the MLS (e.g., use of ShowingTime or other similar services). Brokers and agents are now strictly prohibited from referencing any form of cooperating compensation regardless of the type of transaction (e.g., residential, commercial, vacant land, rentals, or any other type of real estate transaction). Additionally, no reference to any form of cooperating compensation may be made or included in the agent or public remarks field. This does not preclude an agent or broker from including a general link (in the public or agent remarks field) to the broker’s or agent’s general website (where a broker may advertise cooperating compensation).</p><h3 id="may-an-offer-of-compensation-still-be-made">May An Offer of Compensation Still Be Made?</h3><p>While offers of cooperating compensation cannot be made on or through the MLS, or other services, they may still be made directly to and through the individual parties (i.e., broker, cooperating broker, seller, and buyer) to a transaction. Offers of compensation may be marketed specifically on a broker’s website, signs, flyers, billboards, social media sites, ads, and by phone and/or text. Clearly, this is a new way of doing business, and while it will take some time to get used to, the parties should be able to acclimate to the changes.</p><h3 id="seller-concessions-permitted-but-not-a-workaround-to-offering-cooperating-compensation">Seller Concessions Permitted, But NOT a Workaround<br>To Offering Cooperating Compensation!</h3><p>Sellers, if they wish, may offer seller concessions to purchasers on the MLS to cover their closing costs. OneKey MLS, LLC has included a new field that allows a seller’s broker or agent to indicate whether a seller is offering a seller concession. If a seller elects to offer a seller concession, the broker or agent may include a specific amount agreed to by the seller, or the field may be left blank.<br><br>While under the settlement there is no specific requirement relating to NAR implementing any rules with regard to seller concessions, the settlement does require that “an MLS must ensure that the seller concessions are not limited to or conditioned upon the retention of or payment to a cooperating broker, buyer broker, or other buyer representative.” NAR indicates that it will be left up to local MLSs to determine whether they will include seller concessions.<br><br>It is important to note that seller concessions are negotiable and will only become binding if it is specifically included in a contract of sale. Therefore, the agents representing both sellers and buyers, must ensure that any terms, or amount, of a seller’s concession be included in the Memorandum of Sale provided to the parties’ attorneys, so they may be included in the contract of sale. HGAR has prepared a form of Memorandum of Sale that brokers and agents may utilize. Again, it is important to stress that brokers and agents should <strong>not</strong> attempt to use the seller concession field as a “workaround” or a way to make an offer of cooperating compensation.</p><h3 id="new-and-updated-hgar-and-nysar-forms">New and Updated HGAR and NYSAR Forms</h3><p>As mentioned, the settlement has necessitated expansive changes to current forms being utilized by agents and brokers, as well as the introduction of new forms. Both the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc. and the New York State Association of Realtors have made these new forms available to their members. Below are some of the key forms that have been made available by either HGAR, NYSAR, or both (as noted below):</p><ul>
<li>Addendum to Exclusive Right to Rent Agreement (HGAR only)</li>
<li>Addendum to Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement (HGAR only)</li>
<li>Cooperating Compensation Agreement – Rentals (between Broker and Landlord) (HGAR only)</li>
<li>Cooperating Compensation Agreement – Sale (between Seller and Listing Broker) (both HGAR and NYSAR)</li>
<li>Cooperating Broker Compensation Agreement with Listing Broker (between Listing Broker and Cooperating Broker) (NYSAR only)</li>
<li>Exclusive Buyer Agency (Compensation) Agreement (both HGAR and NYSAR)</li>
<li>Non-Exclusive Buyer Agency (Compensation) Agreement (both HGAR and NYSAR)</li>
<li>Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement (both HGAR and NYSAR)</li>
<li>Exclusive Right to Rent Agreement (both HGAR and NYSAR)</li>
<li>Memorandum of Sale (HGAR only)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important for brokers and agents to note that where a similar form has been made available by both HGAR and NYSAR, those forms do contain varying provisions. Every broker must carefully review each form, and ultimately determine which they would like to utilize.<br><br>Additionally, these are standard forms that have been prepared for the general use and benefit of the members of NYSAR and HGAR. However, like all forms, they may need to be revised and/or modified specifically for each real estate transaction. It is strongly recommended that if any of the parties wish to modify any of the forms, that they seek the advice of independent legal counsel before doing so. Brokers and agents should also always recommend that their seller and buyer clients review any and all agreements with their attorneys.</p><h3 id="clear-and-conspicuous-language-%E2%80%98compensation-is-fully-negotiable-and-not-set-by-law%E2%80%99">Clear and Conspicuous Language:<br>‘Compensation is Fully Negotiable and Not Set by Law’</h3><p>One major requirement of the settlement involves the addition of specific language, in all agreements between sellers and buyers, and their respective brokers and/or cooperating brokers, that “clearly and conspicuously” states that compensation is <strong>not</strong> set by law (or by any entity) and that it is <strong>fully </strong>negotiable. All of the forms prepared by HGAR and NYSAR now include the required language. The compensation agreements must also indicate that the buyer’s and seller’s brokers are <strong>not </strong>permitted to receive any amounts in excess of the compensation agreed to in the agreements.</p><h3 id="written-buyer-compensation-agreements">Written Buyer Compensation Agreements</h3><p>Another critical change arising from the settlement is the requirement that all brokers must now enter into <strong>written </strong>agreements with any buyers they are “working with.” If an agent or broker is “working with” a buyer, then prior to “touring” a property with a buyer, a written agreement must be entered into with that buyer. It must also contain an “<em>objectively ascertainable</em>” amount of compensation (i.e., not “open-ended,” no ranges, etc.).<br><br>Compensation can be a fixed fee, a percentage of the purchase price, based on an hourly rate, retainer, it can be for a set fee in connection with a one-time showing or non-exclusive agency agreement, it can be based upon a geographic range, or it can be for a set time period. It can also be limited solely to those properties that offer cooperating compensation, provided this is clearly explained to the buyer prior to showing any properties or entering into any agreement.</p><h3 id="non-exclusive-and-exclusive-buyer-agency-compensation-agreements-one-time-showing-agreements">Non-Exclusive and Exclusive Buyer Agency (Compensation) Agreements; One-Time Showing Agreements</h3><p>There are customarily two types of agreements buyers and their agents, enter into: (1) an exclusive agency agreement, or (2) a non-exclusive agency agreement. HGAR and NYSAR have revised and made these forms available. One-time showing agreements have been also recently introduced. Basically, a one-time showing agreement is a type of non-exclusive agreement. HGAR and NYSAR have not provided one-time showing agreement forms.</p><p>While one-time showing agreements may be fine (and may comply with the settlement requirements)—if what is being sought is a non-exclusive arrangement, entering into a more comprehensive non-exclusive agency agreement, such as the forms offered by HGAR and NYSAR, is recommended. This would avoid the need for the buyer’s agent to enter into multiple one-time showing agreements, and would also allow for the inclusion of expanded rights, duties, obligations and remedies of the parties in one comprehensive agreement.</p><h3 id="how-does-a-buyer-request-a-seller-to-pay-the-commission">How Does a Buyer Request a Seller to Pay the Commission?</h3><p>A buyer must also be made aware of the various options available when requesting that a seller pay the buyer’s broker’s commission. A buyer can choose one or more of the following options: (1) have the seller pay buyer’s broker the commission directly at closing; (2) have the seller provide the buyer with a credit to pay the commission; or (3) negotiate a seller concession. It is important for brokers to understand the various options and to transmit them to the listing broker along with the buyer’s offer.</p><p>Additionally, it is critical that brokers inform buyers that in the event the seller is not willing to cover all, or any portion, of the buyer’s broker’s commission, the buyer will remain responsible for the payment of the full commission, or any portion not covered by the seller. Again, the broker may not make more than what was originally agreed to, and if any additional compensation is offered, it would need to be used to benefit the buyer.</p><h3 id="new-provisions-added-regarding-dual-agency">New Provisions Added Regarding Dual Agency</h3><p>Both the Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement forms and the Buyer Agency forms include new provisions relating to the payment of commissions in connection with dual agency. It is important for the agents and brokers to familiarize themselves with these provisions so they can review and discuss the different options available to sellers and buyers with regard to compensation when there is a dual agency relationship.</p><h3 id="new-forms-relating-to-cooperating-compensation">New Forms Relating to Cooperating Compensation</h3><p>New forms have also been made available for use by and between the buyer, seller, listing broker and/or cooperating broker, regarding cooperating compensation. HGAR has prepared two forms of Cooperating Compensation Agreement, one for a sale transaction and one for a rental transaction. These forms are for use between a seller, buyer, listing broker, and cooperating broker once the parties have agreed to the cooperating compensation arrangement. NYSAR has also prepared a form of Cooperating Compensation Agreement, however, this form is for use only between a seller and a cooperating broker.<br><br>Additionally, NYSAR has prepared a form of Cooperating Compensation Agreement to be utilized where a seller authorizes the listing broker to pay the cooperating broker its compensation directly from the commission due from the seller. This agreement is entered into between the listing broker and cooperating broker. At this time, HGAR has not prepared a separate form regarding this specific scenario and members may utilize the NYSAR form.</p><h3 id="additional-protections-included-in-new-and-revised-forms">Additional Protections Included in New and Revised Forms</h3><p>Existing dispute resolution provisions were also modified and expanded, and included in many of the forms. In the event the parties are unable to amicably resolve a dispute through mediation, the parties would be required to submit to mandatory binding arbitration (in lieu of commencing a lawsuit in court) in accordance with NAR procedures.<br><br>The forms also include important waiver provisions, namely: (1) waiver of trial (and jury trial), and (2) waiver of class action lawsuits. These waiver provisions avoid and protect against costly lawsuits and class action litigation. Because these provisions ask that the parties to waive important rights, they have been made “clear and conspicuous.” The parties must also initial these provisions and acknowledge that have they been provided with an opportunity to consult with their own legal counsel.<br><br><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Sales of single-family homes declined in all six areas, with the Bronx experiencing the largest decline at 18.5%, followed by Rockland County with a 10.6% drop.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Median sales prices for single-family homes rose in the Bronx and all five lower Hudson Valley regions with Westchester County again setting a new record-high at $1.118 million. The last record high recorded for median sales in Westchester was in June at $1.03 million. Putnam County saw the highest gain at 26.3% to a new median high of $625,000, according to a report released today (Sept. 19) by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Inc.</p><p>However, sales of single-family homes declined in all six areas, with the Bronx experiencing the largest decline at 18.5%, followed by Rockland County with a 10.6% drop. Inventory of single-family homes saw double digit declines in almost all regions with the exception of Sullivan County with a 14.6% increase of homes on the market.</p><p>Sales of Bronx condos fared much better, with a 16.7% increase, followed by Westchester, with a 14.7% hike. While Putnam’s condo market is small, the county did experience a 44% increase in closed sales, reporting 13 condos sold last month compared with just nine in August of 2023. Sullivan County reported the highest surge in condo median sales prices by 65.9% to a new high of $224,000.</p><p>Sales of co-ops in Rockland jumped 12.5%, while the Bronx saw a slight uptick of 3.9% in sales. Westchester’s co-op sales declined by 26.4% in August. Rockland also experienced the largest increase in co-op median sales prices by 63.9% to $191,000.</p><p>Today’s report by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR), based on data supplied by OneKey MLS, shows a steady increase in median sales prices across all housing types. “Lower inventory and strong demand continue to fuel home prices throughout the New York metro area and lower Hudson Valley,” “said HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez. “Declining interest rates should result in more properties coming onto the market this fall, creating a more balanced market.”</p><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Single-family home sales decreased by 18.5% in August and the median sales price rose slightly by 3.6 % to $650,000 from August 2023. Condo sales jumped by 16.7%, but the median price declined by 13.5% to $265.000, down from $306,250 last year. Sales in the co-op market saw a 3.9% increase, but a 10.6% decline in the median sales price to $257,000. The median co-op sales price in August 2023 was $287,500.<br><br>New listings for all three property types declined, with the co-op market decreasing the most at 9.1%. Overall inventory fell by over 30% for both single-family homes and condos, but just 4.9% for co-ops. As of August, there were 6.4 months of supply, down by 11.1% from last month. Overall pending sales for all property types were up by 8.4%</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>Once again, Westchester set a new record for the highest single-family median sales price at $1.118 million, topping June’s record high price of $1.031 million. Both the condo and co-op markets experienced growth in median sales prices of 10.3% and 12.6%, respectively. August’s median price for condos was $517,700, and $227,500 for co-ops. However, co-op sales were down by 26.4% in August and single-family homes by 9.9%. Only the condo market saw an increase in sales, at 14.7%.</p><p>New listings declined for single-family homes and condos at 7.6% and 4.1%, respectively, but increased slightly for co-ops at 2.7%. Overall inventory for all property types declined, with co-ops seeing the largest decrease at 19.3%, followed by single-family homes at 16.7% and condos but 6.3%. Months of supply was down 11.2% to just 2.4 months, and pending sales for all property types increased by 2.4%.</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>While single-family home sales in Putnam County declined by 5.7% in August, condo sales escalated by 44.4%. A small condo market, Putnam offered 13 condos for sale last month, from just nine last year at this time. The median sales price of single-family homes rose significantly—by 26.3% to $625,000, over just $495,000 in August of 2023. Median prices for condos edged slightly forward by 2.6% $395,000.</p><p>New listings for condos increased by 14.3% but dropped by 11.3% for single-family homes. Months of supply for all property types decreased by 9.4% to 2.9 months but pending sales rose by 4.6%. There were no co-op sales reported in August.</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Rockland’s co-op market, albeit a small segment, saw a 12.5% rise in sales last month and a 63.9% surge in the median sales price of $191,000, from just $116,500 in August of 2023. Sales of condos and single-family homes decreased by 22.2% and 10.6%, respectively. The condo market saw an 18.6% increase in the median sales price to $421,000, while the median price of single-family homes grew by 7.8% to $748,750.</p><p>New listings for co-ops shot up 57.1% over last year, followed by an 11.7% increase for single-family homes and a 10.7% hike for condos. Inventory remained flat for condos but decreased 8.7% for single-family homes and 4.5% for co-ops. Months of supply dropped 3.4% to 2.8 months but pending sales for all property types grew by 22.7%</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>In Orange County, sales of single-family homes decreased by 4.2%, while condo closings fell by 29.8%. Co-op sales increased by 50%, but with the county’s co-op market so sparse, the increment moved from just two co-ops last August to three in 2024. However, co-op median sales prices saw a 25% hike to $159,900. Condos experienced a median sales increase of 8.8% to $310,000 and single-family homes, a 1.1% uptick to $465,000.</p><p>New listings for single-family homes rose by 3.3% and condo listings by 2.4%.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales fell in August, according to data released today (Sept. 19) by the National Association of Realtors. Three out of four major U.S. regions posted sales declines while the Midwest registered no change. Year-over-year, sales slipped in three regions but remained stable in the Northeast.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—declined 2.5% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.86 million in August. Year-over-year, sales retracted 4.2% (down from 4.03 million in August 2023).</p><p>“Home sales were disappointing again in August, but the recent development of lower mortgage rates coupled with increasing inventory is a powerful combination that will provide the environment for sales to move higher in future months,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The home-buying process, from the initial search to getting the house keys, typically takes several months.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of August was 1.35 million units, up 0.7% from July and 22.7% from one year ago (1.1 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 4.2-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 4.1 months in July and 3.3 months in August 2023.</p><p>“The rise in inventory—and, more technically, the accompanying months’ supply—implies home buyers are in a much-improved position to find the right home and at more favorable prices,” Yun added. “However, in areas where supply remains limited, like many markets in the Northeast, sellers still appear to hold the upper hand.”</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $416,700, up 3.1% from one year ago ($404,200). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.<br><br>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 26 days in August, up from 24 days in July and 20 days in August 2023.<br><br>First-time buyers were responsible for 26% of sales in August—matching the all-time low last seen in November 2021—and down from 29% in both July 2024 and August 2023. NAR’s 2023 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released in November 2023—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 32%.<br><br>All-cash sales accounted for 26% of transactions in August, down from 27% in both July and one year ago.<br><br>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 19% of homes in August, down from 13% in July 2024 and 16% in August 2023.<br><br>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 1% of sales in August, unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates">Mortgage Rates</h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.2% as of Sept. 12. That’s down from 6.35% one week ago and 7.18% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales">Single-Family and Condo/Co-Op Sales</h3><p>Single-family home sales decreased 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48 million in August, down 3.3% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $422,100 in August, up 2.9% from August 2023.</p><p>Existing condominium and co-op sales in August were identical to July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 380,000 units, down 11.6% from one year ago (430,000 units).

    <description><![CDATA[For the build alternative that involves the construction of a general use third lane with interchange improvements and mobility and access improvements, the total cost estimate is $1,412,500,000.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—A review of the 132-page “Scoping Report” for the “NYS Route 17 Mobility and Access Improvements Project” also known as the Route 17 expansion project, reveals that the two build alternatives being advanced by the New York State Department of Transportation for further study would each cost more than $1.3 billion to complete.</p><p>Both alternatives are centered mainly around expansion/improvements in the Orange County corridor between Exit 130 and Exit 120 of Route 17. An updated project timeline calls for a Record of Decision on the scope of the project by February 2026 and the issuance of all necessary permits and approvals to allow for the commencement of construction by May 2026.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has previously committed $1 billion in funding for the Route 17 improvement project, announced the release of the NYSDOT-authored Route 17 scoping report on Friday, Sept. 19.</p><p>“Like so many of our bridges and highways, State Route 17 is a product of the mid-20th Century that no longer meets the needs and demands of 21st Century New Yorkers,” Gov. Hochul said. “This scoping report reflects the ongoing partnership that exists between the state and the community as we seek to reimagine this vital roadway into a modern highway that will reduce congestion, enhance safety, promote tourism and improve quality of life in some of the fastest growing regions of the state.”</p><p>The State Route 17 Mobility &amp; Access Improvement Project involves improvements to the stretch of State Route 17 between Exit 113 in Wurtsboro, Sullivan County, and Interstate 87 in Orange County. It is intended to address operational and safety deficiencies, improve congestion-related travel times and address features of the corridor that currently do not meet interstate standards. Multi-modal improvements will also be assessed and considered, state officials noted.</p><p>As part of the scoping process, the New York State Department of Transportation, in partnership with the Federal Highway Administration, solicited input from the public, stakeholders and involved agencies on the project needs, project concepts and scope of issues to be addressed for the project. As a result, NYSDOT is advancing two “build” alternatives in addition to a “no-build” alternative for further study in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). NYSDOT expects to publish a Draft EIS for the project in August 2025.</p><p>One alternative (“Concept 1”) being advanced would retain State Route 17’s existing two-lane mainline layout throughout most of the corridor while adding interchange auxiliary lanes between Exit 130 and Exit 130A and new collector-distributor (C-D) service roads from Exit 120 to Exit 122 and from Exit 122A to Exit 124. State officials explained that a C-D road separates freeway through traffic from other vehicles that are exiting or entering the freeway and helps keep weaving and lane-changing vehicles away from high-speed traffic on the mainline freeway.</p><p>A second alternative (“Concept 3”) being advanced for further study calls for the construction of a third travel lane from Exit 120 (State Route 211) to Exit 130A (U.S. Route 6) in addition to new auxiliary lanes and C-D roads.</p><p>Both build alternatives would also make targeted safety improvements throughout the entire corridor, including slope and curve modifications, shoulder upgrades and improvements to pedestrian and mass transit accommodations.</p><p>Several interchanges—including Exit 120 (State Route 211)—would also be reconstructed under both build alternatives. The closure of some exits, including Exit 114 (Mamakating Road) in Sullivan County, will be the subject of further study during the EIS process. The closure of Exit 114 has been controversial and has been criticized by some local residents and businesses.</p><p>The Route 17 project, subject to the federal NEPA process, mandates the No Build Alternative be part of the environmental review process. The scoping document reveals that NYSDOT had also considered a third alternative (“Concept 2”) that called for the construction of a peak period shoulder lane in both directions of Route 17 from Exit 122, Crystal Run Road to Exit 130, NYS Route 208. “The roadway footprint would be widened into the existing 44-foot-wide median area to accommodate the proposed peak period shoulder lane while minimizing right-of-way impacts. Proposed C-D roads would be constructed from Exit 120 to Exit 122 and from Exit 122A to Exit 124,” the report stated.</p><p>According to the scoping report although this alternative satisfied the NYSDOT screening activity, “Concept 2 could not be implemented using standard and available resources and technology at this time and thus, will not be advanced for further study in the DDR/DEIS.”</p><p>On page 121 of the scoping report, NYSDOT detailed the project cost estimates of the two build alternatives. For the Build Alternative that calls for two lanes with operational improvements, interchange improvements, and mobility and access improvements, the total cost estimate is $1,302,000.00.</p><p>For the build alternative that involves the construction of a general use third lane with interchange improvements and mobility and access improvements, the total cost estimate is $1,412,500.00.</p><p>New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “State Route 17 is an important connector between New York’s downstate regions and some of the most popular and fastest-growing regions upstate, including the Catskills and Southern Tier. The scoping report is an important milestone in the environmental review process, but our work is ongoing and we will continue to engage with the community to ensure that the end result is a project that reflects the community’s input and addresses the safety needs of the system.”</p><p>Elected officials and business and construction trade organizations expressed continued support for the Route 17 expansion initiative and acknowledged the importance of the study reaching the scoping report milestone.</p><p>In a joint statement, Maureen Halahan, President and CEO, Orange County Partnership, 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair and Marc Baez, President and CEO, Sullivan County Partnership, 17-Forward-86 Coalition co-chair, said, “Enhancing safety on Route 17 is of paramount importance as our region continues to grow with new business investments, residents and record numbers of visitors. Our infrastructure needs to grow with these developments, and expanding capacity on Route 17 will go a long way toward making the corridor safer for everyone traveling on it. We are grateful to Governor Hochul, and our local and state representatives for their leadership in moving this critical project forward.”</p><p>NYSDOT reports the anticipated project timeline to be the following:</p><p><strong>Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS (DEIS)—August 2025<br>Public Hearing—September 2025<br>45-day DEIS Comment Period (begins with the Notice of Availability of the DEIS) August—October 2025<br>Issue Combined FEIS/ROD—February 2026<br>Issue all Project Permits and Authorization Decisions (if a Build Alternative is selected)—May 2026</strong></p><h3 id="first-phase-of-route-17-improvements-to-begin-construction-in-early-2025">First Phase of Route 17 Improvements<br>To Begin Construction in Early 2025</h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Although not part of the improvements currently being studied by NYSDOT, what the department considers as the first phase of the Route 17 improvements will be upgrades to Exit 122 (Crystal Run Road in Middletown).<br><br>NYSDOT has scheduled a bid opening for Dec. 19 on the project that calls for further upgrades to Exit 122. Construction on the project, once awarded, should begin in early 2025. NYSDOT officials have estimated the cost of that project at between $75 million to $85 million. Initial upgrades to the Exit 122 interchange upgrade were completed in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The Northeast PHSI diminished 4.6% from last month to 61.6, a drop of 2.2% from August 2023.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—U.S. pending home sales in August rose 0.6%, according to a report released today (Sept. 26) by the National Association of Realtors. The Midwest, South and West posted monthly gains in transactions, while the Northeast recorded a loss. Year-over-year, the West registered growth, but the Northeast, Midwest and South declined.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—increased to 70.6 in August. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 3.0%.</p><p>An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which was the first year to be examined. By coincidence, the volume of existing-home sales in 2001 fell within the range of 5.0 million to 5.5 million, which is considered normal for the current U.S. population.</p><p>“A slight upward turn reflects a modest improvement in housing affordability, primarily because mortgage rates descended to 6.5% in August,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, contract signings remain near cyclical lows even as home prices keep marching to new record highs.”</p><p>The Northeast PHSI diminished 4.6% from last month to 61.6, a drop of 2.2% from August 2023. The Midwest index intensified 3.2% to 70.0 in August, down 3.6% from one year ago. The South PHSI grew 0.1% to 83.6 in August, receding 5.3% from the prior year. The West index increased 3.2% in August to 58.0, up 2.7% from August 2023.</p><p>“In terms of home sales and prices, the New England region has performed relatively better than other regions in recent months,” Yun noted “Contract signings rose in both the most affordable and most expensive regions—the Midwest and West, respectively—because mortgage rates have fallen nationally. Housing affordability will continue to see notable improvements.”</p><p>“The Federal Reserve does not directly control mortgage rates, but the anticipation of more short-term interest rate cuts has pushed long-term mortgage rates down to near 6% in late September,” added Yun. “On a typical $300,000 mortgage, that translates to approximately $300 per month in mortgage payment savings compared to a few months ago.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-08-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-09-26-2024-1000w-1500h-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/2024-08-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-09-26-2024-1000w-1500h-2.webp 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-08-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-09-26-2024-1000w-1500h-2.webp 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[NYPA is pursuing an “aggressive” time line that projects a definitive development agreement to be reached with Hamilton Green Partners by November 2024 and the move-in to its new corporate headquarters by June 2027.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp;WHITE PLAINS—On Oct. 8, the New York Power Authority Board of Trustees approved a request authorizing staff to negotiate a binding development agreement with the developers of the Hamilton Green project, currently under construction, to build a new nearly 300,000-square-foot corporate headquarters building at the project site in Downtown White Plains. The Board also authorized the allocation of $50 million to cover costs associated with the new corporate headquarters project for the remainder of this year, including the purchase of air rights for the property at the former White Plains Mall site.&nbsp;A knowledgeable source has indicated the development cost for the new state-of-the art NYPA headquarters could approach $300 million.</p><p>The NYPA Finance Committee approved a request by Lori Alesio, executive vice president and general counsel of NYPA, on Sept. 17 to authorize staff to negotiate a Definitive Agreement with Hamilton Green II Partners, LLC to build a new 297,105-square-foot corporate headquarters building for NYPA across the street at the former White Plains Mall site from its current headquarters building at 123 Main St. in Downtown White Plains. The Hamilton Green II Partners consists of Cappelli Enterprises of White Plains and RXR of New York City.</p><p>Alesio noted that NYPA issued an RFP for a new corporate headquarters and a buyer for its current headquarters building back in August of 2023. NYPA received three responses from developers and in November 2023 decided to move forward on two proposals. She reported that NYPA entered a non-binding letter of intent with Hamilton Green Partners in May of 2024 and signed a non-binding offer sheet with the development partnership in August of 2024. <em>Real Estate In-Depth </em>published an <a href="https://realestateindepth.com/exclusive-new-york-power-authority-seeks-new-corporate-headquarters-in-downtown-white-plains/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>exclusive report</strong></a> on the NYPA headquarters request in December 2023.</p><p>The Finance Committee also approved a request for $50 million to fund initial capital expenditures in connection with the development site. The NYPA Board of Trustees is also expected to vote on the $50 million in funding for the new headquarters project at its session on Oct. 8. Alesio explained that $30 million will be used for the purchase of the pad/air rights at the development site and $20 million for costs associated with the purchase of equipment and the design of the building for the remainder of 2024.</p><p>She said that NYPA is pursuing an “aggressive” time line that projects a definitive development agreement to be reached with Hamilton Green Partners by November 2024 and the move-in to its new corporate headquarters by June 2027.</p><p>The new headquarters would provide NYPA with a modern-designed building with many energy-efficient amenities and also fulfill its commitment to the City of White Plains to build a new headquarters building in Downtown White Plains and be a part of the business district’s revitalization.</p><p>No other terms of the transaction were disclosed. In addition, it is not known at press time the status of the component of the RFP that called for the sale of its current headquarters property, which rises 16 stories and totals 417,014 square feet with an integrated six-story, 700-space parking structure. The office property, which houses approximately 900 NYPA employees, was built in 1981 and acquired by NYPA in 1991.</p><p>The scope of the potential development project at the Hamilton Green development greater focus recently during a Sept. 30th session of the White Plains Common Council. The <em>Westchester County Business Journal</em> first reported that Mark Weingarten of DelBello, Donnellan, Weingarten, Wise &amp; Wiederkehr, LLP, presented an application to amend the project’s approved Conceptual Development Plan to change the approved use of 220 Hamilton Ave. from residential to office use.</p><p>Janet J. Giris, a partner with the DelBello, Donnellan, Weingarten, Wise &amp; Wiederkehr firm, in a letter submitted to the Common Council, stated the new office building, part of Phase 2 of the project, would total 297,105 square feet of office space. The amended plan would add approximately 270,000 square feet of office space to the overall project.</p><p>The building would be LEED V.4 and Gold-certified and would be designed to be all electric and energy efficient.</p><p>Other changes to the CDP outlined in the letter include:</p><ul>
<li>Construction of the building at 20 Barker Ave. as an affordable condominium development containing 156 affordable dwelling units;</li>
<li>The addition of a new ingress/egress to the parking structure on Martin Luther King Boulevard, which will serve the proposed office building;</li>
<li>The addition of a new ingress/egress to the parking structure on Barker Avenue, which will serve the residential units at 20 Barker Ave.;</li>
<li>The elimination of all residential units from the building located at 220 Hamilton Ave. and a reduction in the overall number of residential units on the 20 Barker Ave. property from 390 to 156;</li>
<li>A reduction in total retail/restaurant space from 57,805 square feet to 35,603 square feet on the overall property;</li>
<li>An increase in the number of parking spaces on the entire property from 964 to 1,270 parking spaces;</li>
<li>An increase in the private open space from 21,182 square feet to 25,500 square feet on the overall property; and</li>
<li>The addition of two levels of above-parking structured parking on a portion of the 20 Barker Ave. property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Construction of Phase 1 of the project is well underway with rental apartments at 25 Cottage Place scheduled to open before the end of 2024 and 5 Cottage by June 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Eckert of the Orange County Partnership said that national developer interest in Orange County remains “very strong” despite the present financial market volatility. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CAMPBELL HALL—On Sept. 28, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors feted Orange County with a highly informative and well-attended program that focused primarily on commercial and residential real estate trends.</p><p>The program aptly titled “Orange County Day,” held at the Country Club at Otterkill in Campbell Hall, featured association executives who discussed the state of the residential real estate market and legal trends, while Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus; Conor Eckert, Senior Development Officer &amp; Vice President of Business Attraction for the Orange County Partnership; Bill Fioravanti, CEO of the Orange County Industrial Development Agency and Oriona Nikaj, a Board Director of the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets Business Improvement District, who collectively briefed the attendees about the county’s economy and business attraction, expansion and retention efforts.</p><p>The program also included presentations by New York State Assemblyman Christopher Eachus (D-99th District) and via video by New York State Senator James Skoufis (D-42nd District).</p><p>The event kicked off with presentations by Carole McCann, HGAR Regional Director, Orange County; President-elect Vlora Sejdi and HGAR Secretary Rey Hollingsworth Falu.</p><p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez provided the latest statistics on the Orange County residential market, which while experiencing lower sales, is enjoying rising prices and continued solid demand. She also reported on a host of association initiatives and upcoming events.</p><p>Eckert of the Orange County Partnership said that national developer interest in Orange County remains “very strong” despite the present financial market volatility.</p><p>He noted that there are a number of potential development sites in the county that have completed the municipal approval process. In fact, he related that the county currently has approximately three million square feet of industrial space/commercial space that have come onto the market in the past three years.</p><p>“We have a multitude of sites coming to market so that we can satisfy most industrial requirements,” he noted.</p><p>In 2023, the average industrial rent was $12.75-per-square-foot. However, he said rents are rising in Orange County. He related that a recent deal in the county netted an effective rent of $14.50-per-square-foot. At present there is approximately 250,000 square feet of Class A industrial space available in the county.</p><p>The paramount issue impacting commercial real estate transactions in the county is access to infrastructure (sewer, water and energy). “Unique sites” that have access to water, energy or are adaptive reuse opportunities “are really moving the needle,” Eckert said. He also cited having an available qualified workforce and access to housing as other critical needs going forward.</p><p>“We have sophisticated companies saying, ‘I want your site, but where are my people going to live.’ … So, we need more housing,” he said. He advised that state funding programs, such as FAST NY, the Mid-Hudson Momentum Fund and New York Forward grant programs, are helping developers deal with the high costs associated with development in New York State.</p><p>Eckert said that Orange County, due to its location, is a strategic hub for industrial distribution, but is also now diversifying its economy. Among the emerging industry sectors the county is marketing to include: life sciences/pharmaceutical, advanced technology/microelectronics, semiconductors, clean technology and the offshore wind supply chain.</p><p>He also related that U.S. Senator Charles Schumer recently announced $3,828,000 in federal funding for the Educational and Cultural Trust Fund of the Electrical Industry to help establish a Global Wind Organization onshore and offshore wind safety training facility in the Newburgh/Walden area to train New Yorkers for careers in clean energy. He also related that Orange County had secured $320,000 to perform site analysis and feasibility and the potential for adaptive reuse at the Danskammer and Roseton power plant sites in Newburgh.</p><p>After profiling some of the large possible business attraction and retention opportunities in the current pipeline, Eckert concluded his remarks by saying that he believed the towns of Wawayanda and Wallkill can serve as the hubs for advanced manufacturing in Orange County. He said they have all the key elements users require—power, sewer, water, access to key markets and available sites.</p><p>“So, I think we are going to see amazing opportunities in those two markets in particular over the next decade,” he said.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/461095088_1302064327877155_4191693982644769328_n.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/461095088_1302064327877155_4191693982644769328_n.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/461095088_1302064327877155_4191693982644769328_n.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/461095088_1302064327877155_4191693982644769328_n.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">More than 100 Realtors gathered at the Country Club at Otterkill in Campbell Hal for Orange County Day.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Fioravanti of the Orange County Industrial Development Agency discussed “Understanding IDA Incentives” and related some of the major projects that benefitted from IDA assistance.</p><p>Noting the controversies surrounding incentives, Fioravanti related that unfortunately incentives are necessary in some cases to help offset the high costs of doing business in New York State that could deter investment in Orange County. He said the Orange County IDA is “leveling the playing field” to make the region competitive with other low cost areas.</p><p>He said in terms of development sites, the investor is building at locations that are in many cases raw land that produce little in taxes. “There are no taxes being lost,” Fioravanti stressed. “We are not taking from the school district’s coffers or taking from your neighbor’s taxes in any way.” He also noted that any special district, such as police and fire, are completely excluded and are not impacted by any IDA agreement.</p><p>Nikaj, who is also a real estate agent at CENTURY 21 Realty Center in Monroe and a manager at Bottega Veneta at Woodbury Common, discussed the current expansion proposal involving an estimated $250-million investment that will further elevate the shopping experience for customers and retailers by adding more than 132,000 square feet of retail stores and restaurants, approximately 33,000 square feet of tenant storage space, a 200-key luxury hotel, and more than 3,000 new parking spaces. Most of the development will take place in the Niagara region of the outlet center.</p><p>The project, announced last year by owner Simon, will add more than 3,000 jobs and will open in phases. Once construction is complete, the expansion of Woodbury Common will also generate substantial additional annual tax revenues and economic benefits while attracting increased tourism to the county and region. Nikaj said the added annual tax benefit will total more than $20 million, with $8 million going to New York State, more than $8 million to Orange County, $2 million to the Monroe-Woodbury School District, more than $570,000 to the Town of Woodbury, $377,000 to the Village of Woodbury, $283,000 to the Town of Woodbury Police and $712,000 to the MTA.</p><p>Among the other benefits from the expansion project will include 770 additional full-time and part-time jobs, plus an additional 296 indirect and induced jobs in New York State and nearly 2,000 direct and indirect construction jobs, including 1,659 on site, according to Indianapolis-based Simon.</p><p>Orange County Executive Neuhaus noted that in his 2024 budget, he has proposed the ninth consecutive property tax cut for Orange County residents. He said the fiscal strength of Orange County relies on its solid economic base and its growing sales tax revenue.</p><p>He said that Orange County is investing heavily in maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure. During the question-and-answer segment of the program, Neuhaus was asked to comment on the recent release of the scoping document for the Route 17 expansion that had project estimates for the two options to be studied by NYSDOT at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. The construction timeline puts the first shovel on the roadway expansion in 2026. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has committed $1 billion for the Route 17 expansion.</p><p>Neuhaus responded that the Hudson Valley region is underfunded by New York State and its roads are in poor condition. He said that state government must find a way to fund the Route 17 project. “Pay the damn bill. I have been hearing about Route 17 being converted to I-86 since I have been in diapers. It’s like ‘Big Food.’ I think it might exist… Get it done. Figure it out,” he said.</p><p>The Orange County Day program concluded with a Legal Update by John Dolgetta, Esq., principal and managing member of Dolgetta Law PPLC, who covered the latest developments in the NAR settlement case and practice changes that have been instituted and implemented by NAR, NYSAR and HGAR.</p><p>The premier event sponsor was OneKey MLS.

    <description><![CDATA[The growing number of closed sales is concentrated in the lower end of the luxury market.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RYE BROOK—Luxury home sales north of New York City have increased in Westchester County (closed sales of $2 million and higher) and Putnam/Dutchess (closed sales of $1 million and higher) by double digits.</p><p>The growing number of closed sales is concentrated in the lower end of the luxury market. For example, sales over $5 million have declined in Westchester County and pended sales, a forward-looking indicator, of $5 million and more are down from the same period last year, according to the Houlihan Lawrence Q3 Luxury Market Report</p><p>In Greenwich, CT, demand is strong up to the $10-million and higher price bracket. The number of active $10 million and higher listings has increased by 50% from last year and demand (pended sales) has dramatically dropped off. The report noted that there are a finite number of uber-luxury buyers in every market. Perhaps so many buyers already made a $10-million higher purchase in the past few years that fewer remaining buyers equate to a statistical sales drop.</p><p>In other markets in Connecticut, such as Darien and New Canaan, luxury inventory is being absorbed quickly. The report stated that once rates take a meaningful decline, many sellers with a low-interest rate mortgage may reconsider putting their homes on the market and help to bolster the number of luxury homes for sale.</p><p>The recent interest rate decline and the resiliency of the equities markets is positive economic news for the luxury market. The presidential election, just one month away, is weighing heavily on the minds of most voters. However, it has been noted that many would-be luxury buyers stayed on the sidelines during past presidential election years until a president was elected. The fourth quarter market report may illuminate the impact of the election with data-based insight.</p><h3 id="q3-markets-at-a-glance-q3-2024-vs-q3-2023">Q3 MARKETS AT A GLANCE (Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023)</h3><p><br><strong>Westchester County Luxury Home Sales /$2M and Higher</strong><br>Homes Sold: Up 23.9%<br>Median Sale Price: Down 3.4%<br>Q3 Highest Sale Price: $9,900,000, Rye City</p><p><strong>Putnam and Dutchess County Luxury Home Sales /$1M and Higher</strong><br>Homes Sold: Up 34.4%<br>Median Sale Price: Down 4.9%<br>Q3 Highest Sale Price Putnam: $3,500,000, Garrison<br>Q3 Highest Sale Price Dutchess: $3,675,000, Amenia</p><p><strong>Greenwich, CT Luxury Home Sales /$3M and Higher</strong><br>Homes Sold: Up 24.6%<br>Median Sale Price: Down 13.7%<br>Q3 Highest Sale Price: $13,750,000, Greenwich</p><p><strong>Darien, CT Luxury Home Sales /$2M and Higher</strong><br>Homes Sold: Up 21.2%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 13.1%<br>Q3 Highest Sale Price: $6,500.000</p><p><strong>New Canaan, CT Home Sales /$2M and Higher</strong><br>Homes Sold: Up 11.8%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 0.4%<br>Q3 Highest Sale Price: $6,325,000</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“If approved (by the court) on Nov. 26, we can finally put this in our rearview mirror,” Sears said. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—National Association of Realtors President Kevin Sears met with HGAR members and guests on Oct. 7 at the Kanopi Restaurant atop The Opus in Downtown White Plains and provided the latest updates on the NAR settlement, discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice, proposed budget cuts for 2025 and his views of the real estate market going forward.</p><p>The second-generation Realtor from Springfield, MA, told the gathering of more than 50 Realtors that “2025 is going to be a big year” no matter the outcome of the Presidential election in November. Sears took over as NAR President in January 2024. The more than 30-year real estate veteran has traveled far and wide during his tenure. A few months in office, Sears and NAR staff were successful in settling a multi-billion-dollar commission lawsuit for $418 million.</p><p>Sears, who will be serving as 2025 NAR President, told the HGAR crowd that NAR is hoping to secure court approval of the settlement in November and will likely make the first payment in connection with the settlement—approximately $197 million—sometime during the first quarter of 2025. He said the funds would come out of NAR’s reserves and the current proposed 2025 budget that will be presented to the NAR Board of Directors next month does not call for an increase in dues.</p><p>He related that in 2026, 2027 and 2028, NAR will pay approximately $72 million each year to satisfy the settlement.</p><p>“If approved (by the court) on Nov. 26, we can finally put this in our rearview mirror,” Sears said.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/JVP_0588.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1336" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/JVP_0588.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/JVP_0588.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/JVP_0588.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/JVP_0588.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, HGAR RPAC Co-Chair Anthony Domathoti, HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez, NAR President Kevin Sears, HGAR RPAC Co-Chair JP Endres and OneKey MLS CEO Richard Haggerty. PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Among some of the highlights of his presentation, Sears said that NAR is budgeting for a 10% decrease in membership in 2025. He said that most of the drop in membership is due to market conditions and the drop in transactions, with minimal membership decline related to the NAR settlement and the practice changes that have resulted since then.</p><p>“The National Association of Realtors will be a little bit leaner and meaner,” Sears said, noting that the proposed budget calls for a $20-million reduction in expenditures that would result in a net-zero budget for the year. He noted that its advocacy budget, if approved, would be cut by $9 million.</p><p>“This is going to hurt us all, but we can’t cripple any one (department),” he related.</p><p>Sears also said that despite some frustrations, he is hopeful that future discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice over NAR’s practices will be fruitful.</p><p>When discussing his views on the market going forward, Sears in an apparent swipe on those who predict Artificial Intelligence will replace the Realtor in the years to come, related that going forward, “One thing that I believe will be constant… is that Realtors will remain at the center of the transaction.”</p><p>He said because there are too many variables, such as the outcome of the Presidential election and the party that controls Congress, interest rates and national and international events, it is difficult to predict just how the market will be in 2025.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/JVP_0687-1-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/JVP_0687-1-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/JVP_0687-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/JVP_0687-1-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/JVP_0687-1-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2024 HGAR President Carmen Bauman PHOTO BY JOHN VECCHIOLLA</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Sears also stressed the importance of advocacy and RPAC. He noted that people are mistaken who say that RPAC buys votes. Instead, he related RPAC “gives Realtors a seat at the table. It gives us a seat in the room where decisions are being made,” he said.</p><p>He later noted a quote by Thomas Jefferson in relation to RPAC’s efforts, saying, “We are not ruled by the majority. We are ruled by the majority who participate.”</p><p>RPAC of New York congratulated HGAR for raising funds for RPAC ($17,750) at the cocktail reception with NAR President Sears and acknowledged HGAR RPAC Co-Chairs, Anthony Domathoti and JP Endres for their efforts. NYSAR leadership that attended the event were 2024 President-elect Jacqlene Rose and Treasurer Ron Garafalo, along with NYSAR Political Affairs Coordinator Derick King.</p><p>Sponsors of the program were: Platinum sponsor, UNMB Home Loans, Gold sponsor, OneKey MLS, and Silver sponsors, Richard Haggerty, CEO OneKey MLS and Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[CID President John Barrett prophetically related, “His legacy and leadership will be evident in this town 100 years from now.” ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a working journalist for more than 40 years, my role has always been as a reporter. Rarely have I shared my opinion with readers because as a reporter, I feel my opinion is not necessary and in most cases, unwelcome. It is rare indeed for me to pen a column due to that professional mantra. However, if you can indulge, the passing of White Plains Mayor Joseph Delfino on Oct. 17 at the age of 92 has prompted me to share some professional and personal thoughts on this true public servant.<br><br>The White Plains native entered politics after a career in the private sector and first admirably served his constituents as a member of the White Plains Common Council and later as a Westchester County Legislator. However, it was his 12 years serving as Mayor of White Plains (1997-2009) that I believe epitomized the true meaning of public service.<br><br>For some background, my family moved to White Plains when I completed my sophomore year of high school in 1973. Relocating from Queens, we lived on Midland Avenue and my first regular job was as the downstairs stockboy at Woolworth’s on Mamaroneck Avenue. I later graduated from the College of White Plains on North Broadway and worked at Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the Westchester County Business Journal, and for nearly 30 years as the editor of <em>Westchester Realtor</em> and <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. I reported first-hand on the accomplishments of the Delfino administration.<br><br>I have reached out to some business and political leaders who interacted with “Mayor Joe” for their memories of this true visionary (see below). As others will attest, his policies and love for his hometown were infectious as well as transformational. I recall him telling me that when he first took office, the only projects before the city were for residential home improvements. There were no development projects in the pipeline. He observed that back in the late 1980s the streets of Downtown White Plains would fold up after 5 p.m. As reported in the October 2009 edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, then outgoing Mayor Deflino reflected on his three terms of office at a meeting of the Westchester County Board of Realtors Commercial Investment Division. At the session, CID President John Barrett prophetically related, “His legacy and leadership will be evident in this town 100 years from now.” The mayor told the CID gathering: “It was a pleasure to make this sea change in our city at a time when it was sorely needed.” He then uttered his familiar refrain that when he first took office: “You could have shot a cannon down Mamaroneck Avenue and hit nobody, nobody.”</p><p>By fostering a business-friendly environment and certainty into the development process, the mayor helped redevelop the downtown district that was replete with vacant storefronts, little consumer traffic and an office vacancy rate of 35% into a thriving commercial hub. What was once home to one-screen theaters and run-down buildings, the mayor helped attract billions of dollars in private investment, high-rise luxury residences and thousands of new residents.<br><br>My other memory of Mayor Joe is very personal but showed the true measure of how much he loved his job and the people of White Plains. The mayor was known to go to every service of a recently passed White Plains resident, no matter how long his day was. This was true for my family on Jan. 20, 2009, at the memorial at Hawthorne Funeral Home for my father Dennis, who had passed away earlier that month. My mother Helen was greeting mourners when “Mayor Joe” arrived. After shaking my hand, the mayor hugged my Mom and spent time with her talking about my father, whom he had met several times. His act of kindness helped my mother and I in that most difficult time and for that, I will forever be in his debt. Mayor Joe, may you rest in peace.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/_V160022.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/_V160022.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/_V160022.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/10/_V160022.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the Sept. 17, 2009 meeting of the WCBR Commercial Investment Division were from left: WCBR Chief Executive Officer P.

I credit Al Del Vecchio for some of the things, Sy Schulman and subsequently Tom Roach and Adam Bradley along the way, but Joe Delfino was the mayor at a pivotal time and when the explosion (of development) in White Plains happened—he managed it. It is hard to manage because people don’t like change and people feel threatened by change. But he was able to manage it and what we see today is a city that is stronger than it has ever been and Joe rightfully has that as part of his legacy. I am going to miss him. I think we will all miss him and I hope that in years to come people will know who Joe Delfino was because he was one heck of a guy.”</em></p><p><strong>Westchester County Executive George Latimer</strong></p><p><em>“We all know Mayor Joe as the man who catalyzed and transformed White Plains into the incredibly vibrant city it has become. He had the unique ability to bring everyone together across all cultures, aisles and viewpoints to achieve the great vision he had to create a world-class city. And how he loved everything about being Mayor. He danced with Asian dragons, attended every cultural event, loved children, seniors, workers and business leaders and always showed his appreciation. And when the White Plains Performing Arts Center was born, he would watch each performance multiple times and stand outside and greet every attendee!<br><br>A true man of the people. I had the honor of traveling on a trip many years ago to Italy with Mayor Joe to build business ties with Italian companies. And we were seatmates on the bus. What a wonderful time we had, learning, laughing, eating and some praying too. That experience led to a long lasting and special relationship between the BCW and the Mayor, with whom we were always supportive as he was to us. Most of all, Mayor Joe’s relationship with his children, Joe and BCW Executive Committee member Cynthia Delfino Birdsall was very special. The relationship Cindy had with her Dad was one which I was fortunate enough to witness personally. I can’t imagine a closer father and daughter, personally, as parent and child, later as a caretaker, and professionally as trusted confidants and advisors. Mayor Joe, you made a difference in the lives of so many and you will remain in our hearts forever.”</em></p><p><strong>Dr. Marsha Gordon<br>President &amp; CEO<br>Business Council of Westchester</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>“When I first met Joe Delfino, I thought to myself that whatever I want to do in White Plains is going to be a hard sell. I’m going to have to convince him beyond a shadow of a doubt that I can pull any particular project off. As the Mayor of a 50,000+ resident city, Joe and his team were somewhat skeptical of any grandiose plans put forth by any developer in White Plains as it seems like he had been disappointed on many occasions after endorsing any complex plan. The ‘convincing him’ part was the mission and after that when he bought in, everyone needed to move over as he was an unstoppable force who would go above and beyond any norm to make things happen. For Cappelli, there would be no City Center, and certainly no Ritz Carlton in two, 45 story towers, in White Plains without this belief and his total commitment. There would be no Renaissance Square Road, in the works for over 30 years, which is a vital connector between the Main St and Hamilton Ave corridors. But all of what I said, well that’s just looking at it through the eyes of a businessman, a developer. But there was a much deeper side, a passionate side that best described Joe as there was a ‘man of the people’ side. Joe would be at every funeral of a friend, loved one or stranger who lived in White Plains and would pay his respects every time someone suffered a loss, whether it was an emotional loss or a financial one such as a house fire or flood. He was quick to respond and even quicker to cause his Chief of Staff and Commissioners to remove the ‘red tape’ and just get the problem resolved without equivocation. He wanted results, no floundering or patience to be delayed in his quest to accomplish.<br><br>While I can’t say we were in constant contact since Joe left office, I’m saddened by his passing, and feel like I have lost both a friend and supporter of my own dreams which I would never have accomplished without him and his loyal staff. One thing I do believe when a person passes, he is measured by what he has left as there is nothing more he can do in the future. The material measurements of his accomplishments in White Plains are great and there for all to continue to see but mostly his emotional, sincere involvement and caring for the city and its residents are even greater to feel. I just wanted to pay my respect in words to Joe Delfino, a great man and as we move forward to always remember the imprint he left on this city, which others who sincerely care about its future are now in control of and are taking the City of White Plains to the next level with extraordinary custody and care. And that’s how it should be. My sincere condolences to his family.”</em></p><p><strong>Louis R. Cappelli<br>Partner<br>Cappelli Enterprises, LLC, White Plains</strong></p><p><em>“Mayor Joe, as he was affectionately, referred to was cut in the mold of Fiorella LaGuardia. Soft spoken, but he carried a big stick. I worked side-by-side with the mayor during our creation of the economic Renaissance in downtown White Plains. He would never accept no as an answer when we were building City Center or when we were recruiting a movie theater or grocery store for downtown White Plains. He required his department heads to meet with the developers on a weekly basis in order to enable this critical building and economic development in downtown White Plains. He was a doer! He was a visionary, and most of all he was a great family man. He will be missed by all, but his legacy will endure.”</em></p><p><strong>Joseph Apicella<br>Executive Vice President<br>MacQuesten Development LLC</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>“Mayor Delfino was a wonderful leader of the City of White Plains. As a department head (Commissioner of Planning) I was able to see the dedication he made to assure that the City of White Plains was moving forward. Working with developers and retail leaders, Mayor Delfino, along with the city's Common Council, forged a strong path that led to The City of White Plains being the economic powerhouse for Westchester. The City of White Plains still benefits from that infusion of development with having a very strong retail base that provides sales tax revenues allowing the City of White Plains to have lower property tax than any of our neighboring communities in Westchester.”</em></p><p><strong>Michael Graessle<br>Associate Broker<br>Howard Hanna Rand Realty, White Plains</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, many small businesses, including most real estate brokerage firms, and real estate investment and holding companies, will not meet these criteria and will therefore be required to comply fully with the CTA’s filing requirements.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Corporate Transparency Act [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4hfQlRC">https://bit.ly/4hfQlRC</a>], enacted as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, went into effect on Jan. 1, 2024, and it introduced significant new disclosure requirements for corporations, limited liability companies and other covered entities operating in the United States. The CTA is primarily designed to combat illicit activities such as money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing by increasing the transparency of business ownership.<br><br>The CTA mandates that certain businesses report specific details about their beneficial owners (i.e., Beneficial Ownership Information or BOI) to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [<u>see</u> <a href="https://fincen.gov/boi">https://fincen.gov/boi</a>]. FinCEN provides important information for companies and individuals [<u>see</u> FAQs <a href="https://bit.ly/3UEVxFl">https://bit.ly/3UEVxFl</a>] relating to the new filing requirements. For many small businesses, particularly in the real estate industry, the disclosures required under the CTA represent a major regulatory shift away from important privacy considerations.</p><h3 id="the-cta-who-must-file-are-there-exemptions-available">The CTA: Who Must File; Are There Exemptions Available?</h3><p>The reporting obligations under the CTA apply to all “reporting companies” as defined under the CTA. “Reporting companies” include most corporations, LLCs, and similar entities that are: (1) created by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office in the U.S.; or (2) formed under foreign laws and registered to do business in the United States.<br><br>The CTA does provide for limited exemptions designed to ease the burden on certain small businesses. Entities that have: (1) more than 20 full-time employees; (2) more than $5 million in gross receipts or sales; and (3) a physical presence in the U.S. are not required to report BOI to FinCEN. Additionally, there are also 23 specific types of entities that also are exempt from the CTA reporting requirements.<br><br>The following is a list of some of the specific types of exempt entities: banks, credit unions, brokers or dealers in securities, security exchanges or clearing agencies, insurance companies, public utilities, tax-exempt and nonprofit entities, and large operating and publicly traded companies. Many of these entities are exempt because they are already subject to substantial federal and state regulation, and other required reporting requirements.<br><br>Unfortunately, many small businesses, including most real estate brokerage firms, and real estate investment and holding companies, will not meet these criteria and will therefore be required to comply fully with the CTA’s filing requirements. However, if an individual operates as a “sole proprietorship” (i.e., not formed through a state agency), that individual would not be subject to the CTA filing requirements since the individual (and the business the individual operates) is not a separate and distinct legal entity.</p><h3 id="beneficial-ownership-information-reporting-requirements">Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Requirements</h3><p>The CTA requires “reporting companies” to disclose the Beneficial Ownership Information of all beneficial owners. “Beneficial owners” are defined as individuals who, directly or indirectly, own or control 25% or more of an entity, or who exercise substantial control over the entity. An individual could be a “beneficial owner” as a result of the “substantial control” element, by ownership interests, or a combination of both.<br><br>The information to be reported includes a beneficial owner’s: (1) full legal name; (2) date of birth; (3) current residential or business address; and (4) the identifying number and issuer from either a non-expired U.S. driver’s license, a non-expired U.S. passport, or a non-expired identification document issued by a state (including a U.S. territory or possession), local government, or Indian tribe. If none of those documents exist, a non-expired foreign passport may be utilized. An image of the document must also be submitted when filing the beneficial ownership information with FinCEN.</p><h3 id="what-constitutes-substantial-control">What Constitutes Substantial Control?</h3><p>It is important to note that all individuals who exercise “substantial control” in a “reporting company” are also deemed to be beneficial owners for purposes of the CTA. Under the CTA there is no limit to the number of individuals who may be required to be included in the filing. FinCEN explains as follows:<br><br>“[a]n individual exercises <em>substantial control </em>over a reporting company if the individual meets <em><u>any</u></em> of four general criteria: (1) the individual is a senior officer; (2) the individual has authority to appoint or remove certain officers or a majority of directors of the reporting company; (3) the individual is an important decision-maker; or (4) the individual has any other form of substantial control over the reporting company.”<br><br>FinCEN also provides important guidance and “indicators” to determine which individuals exercise substantial control. Specific examples provided by FinCEN include the following:</p><ul>
<li>Senior Officers (e.g., such as the President, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or any other individual (irrespective of title) who performs similar functions);</li>
<li>Any individual who has the authority to appoint or remove an officer or the majority of directors of a corporate board or a similar body; and</li>
<li>Any individual who directs or has substantial influence over important decisions of the company (e.g., relating to business operations, mergers, acquisitions, finances, ownership structure, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The CTA also includes a “catchall” which broadens the above descriptions, and requires that the BOI of a beneficial owner be filed if that individual exercises “substantial control” in any “new and unique” way. Additionally, it is important to note that the BOI of trustees of trusts that own an interest in a “reporting company” or that may have “substantial control” as defined above would be required to be submitted with the filing as well.</p><h3 id="key-dates-for-initial-filings">Key Dates for Initial Filings</h3><p>Although the CTA went into effect on Jan. 1, 2024, there are two different categories of filings that need to be noted. The first category includes “reporting companies” that were formed prior to Jan. 1, 2024. These entities will have until Jan. 1, 2025, to file their initial reports. The second category is for new companies that are formed on or after January 1, 2024. These reporting companies must file their initial report within 90 days after their formation.</p><h3 id="are-there-ongoing-filing-requirements">Are There Ongoing Filing Requirements?</h3><p>There is no ongoing annual filing requirement for reporting companies beyond the initial filing. However, all covered entities are required to update the Beneficial Ownership Information of any new beneficial owners within 30 days of any change in ownership or substantial control. Therefore, it is important for covered entities and their shareholders or members to keep track of when additional owners, or any individuals exercising substantial control, join the company.<br><br>It is also important to note that it is common for owners of smaller businesses to transfer ownership interests and/or “substantial control” (in whatever form) in their companies to family members and/or trusts established in connection with their estate and/or other succession planning. Any such transfer would require an update to the initial filing to be submitted to FinCEN within 30 days of such transfer or change.</p><h3 id="penalties-for-non-compliance">Penalties for Non-Compliance</h3><p>The CTA imposes significant penalties for willful non-compliance. Failing to report or to file required updates, submitting inaccurate information, or intentionally evading the requirements of the CTA can lead to: (1) civil penalties of up to $591 per day for each day the violation continues; and (2) criminal penalties including fines up to $10,000 and up to two years of imprisonment for willful violations.</p><h3 id="impact-on-the-real-estate-industry-and-small-businesses">Impact on the Real Estate Industry and Small Businesses</h3><p>Real estate brokers and brokerage firms that operate as LLCs, corporations and other covered entities, and real estate investors and developers who use LLCs to purchase real estate and/or use corporations, LLCs or other covered entities to operate their businesses, will now have to disclose the BOI of all individuals who hold significant control and/or ownership interests (i.e., 25% or more) in these entities.<br><br>While the CTA aims to bring greater transparency, making it harder for illicit actors to launder money through real estate purchases. At the same time, it places an additional burden on those individuals who, and small businesses that, operate within the bounds of the law. For small businesses with straightforward ownership structures, compliance with the CTA may not be overly burdensome. However, businesses with more complex ownership arrangements or those unaccustomed to regulatory filings may find the requirements onerous. Small companies will also face challenges in tracking and reporting changes in ownership within the above-mentioned 30-day period.</p><h3 id="procedures-for-compliance-under-the-cta">Procedures for Compliance under the CTA</h3><p>FinCEN has provided small businesses with resources and information necessary to make filing as quick and easy as possible. FinCEN has prepared a “Small Entity Compliance Guide” [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3C2W9hd">https://bit.ly/3C2W9hd</a>] in plain language and has also prepared various informational videos and webinars, FAQs, and other important information which can all be found on its website [<u>see</u> <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/boi">www.fincen.gov/boi</a>].<br><br>Entities subject to the CTA will need to establish procedures and put systems in place in order to identify and report beneficial owners. First, businesses will need to review their ownership structures to determine who qualifies as a beneficial owner under the CTA. This may require careful analysis, especially in companies with complex or layered ownership models, and/or major decision makers who are not owners.<br><br>Once the “beneficial ownership” status of individuals is established, reports must then be filed electronically with FinCEN, providing the required identifying information for each beneficial owner. FinCEN is expected to issue further guidance on the specific reporting forms and processes as needed.<br><br>Lastly, businesses will then need to develop internal processes to monitor changes in ownership and control, and to ensure that timely updates are filed with FinCEN. This includes tracking changes in stock ownership, management positions, and other factors that could affect beneficial ownership status.</p><h3 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where Do We Go From Here?</h3><p>The CTA represents a significant shift in how business entities are regulated in the U.S., particularly with respect to beneficial ownership transparency. The real estate industry, in particular, will be affected by the increased disclosure requirements, as will small businesses that now face these new compliance burdens. To avoid fines and penalties, businesses must prepare to comply with the new reporting requirements, ensuring that they meet key deadlines and file accurate information with FinCEN.<br><br>It is important for businesses to seek legal guidance to ensure they understand their obligations under the CTA and establish processes to remain compliant going forward. The real estate and small business sectors, in particular, will need to adapt quickly to these new regulations to avoid costly penalties and ensure that accurate and complete information is provided in a timely and complete fashion.<br><br><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Home sales have been essentially stuck at around a four-million-unit pace for the past 12 months, but factors usually associated with higher home sales are developing.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (October 23, 2024) – Existing-home sales drew back in September, according to the National Association of Realtors. Three out of four major U.S. regions registered sales declines while the West experienced a sales bounce. Year-over-year, sales fell in three regions but grew in the West, NAR reported on Oct. 23.<br><br>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—receded 1.0% from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.84 million in September. Year-over-year, sales waned 3.5% (down from 3.98 million in September 2023).<br><br>“Home sales have been essentially stuck at around a four-million-unit pace for the past 12 months, but factors usually associated with higher home sales are developing,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “There are more inventory choices for consumers, lower mortgage rates than a year ago and continued job additions to the economy. Perhaps, some consumers are hesitating about moving forward with a major expenditure like purchasing a home before the upcoming election.”<br><br>Total housing inventory registered at the end of September was 1.39 million units, up 1.5% from August and 23.0% from one year ago (1.13 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 4.3-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 4.2 months in August and 3.4 months in September 2023.<br><br>“More inventory is certainly good news for home buyers as it gives consumers more properties to view before making a decision,” Yun said. “However, the inventory of distressed properties is minimal because the mortgage delinquency rate remains very low.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—In a hopeful sign that market conditions are improving, pending U.S. home sales rose in September, according to the National Association of Realtors. All four major regions experienced month-over-month gains in transactions. Year-over-year, the Northeast and West registered increases while sales remained steady in the Midwest and South, according to the report released on Oct. 30.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—jumped 7.4% to 75.8 in September, the highest level since March (78.3). Year-over-year, pending transactions ascended 2.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“Contract signings rose across all regions of the country as buyers took advantage of the combination of lower mortgage rates in late summer and more inventory choices,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Further gains are expected if the economy continues to add jobs, inventory levels grow, and mortgage rates hold steady.”</p><h3 id="nar-economic-and-housing-outlook">NAR Economic and Housing Outlook</h3><p>In the next two years, Yun foresees slower home price appreciation and corresponding increases in sales.</p><p>“After two years of sluggish home sales in 2023 and 2024, existing-home sales are forecasted to rise to 4.47 million in 2025 and more than 5 million in 2026,” Yun said. “During the next two years, expect a slower rate of growth in home prices that’s roughly in line with the consumer price index because of additional supply reaching the market.”</p><p>Yun predicts the median existing-home price will rise to $410,700 in 2025 and to $420,000 in 2026. The annual 30-year fixed mortgage rate will slide to 5.9% in 2025 but then move higher to 6.1% in 2026.</p><p>View NAR’s Economic and Housing Outlook as of October 2024 at <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/2024-10/forecast-q3-2024-us-economic-outlook-10-04-2024.pdf">https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/2024-10/forecast-q3-2024-us-economic-outlook-10-04-2024.pdf</a></p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI expanded 6.5% from last month to 65.6, up 3.3% from September 2023.

I am deeply committed to delivering value to our members and the communities we serve. With our core services—advocacy, professionalism, and engagement—at the forefront, we will continue to elevate HGAR. To achieve this, we must work together to not just accept change but actively pursue it.</p><p>She later added, “Change isn’t always easy, but it is inevitable and we must embrace it.

    <description><![CDATA[Housing affordability has been a challenge, but the worst appears to be over,”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Approximately 90% of metro markets (196 out of 226, or 87%) registered home price gains in the third quarter of 2024, as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.08% to 6.95%, according to the National Association of Realtors’ latest quarterly report.</p><p>Seven percent of the 226 tracked metro areas recorded double-digit price gains over the same period, down from 13% in the second quarter.</p><p>“Home prices remain on solid ground as reflected by the vast number of markets experiencing gains,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “A typical homeowner accumulated $147,000 in housing wealth in the last five years. Even with the rapid price appreciation over the last few years, the likelihood of a market crash is minimal. Distressed property sales and the number of people defaulting on mortgage payments are both at historic lows.”</p><p>Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price ascended 3.1% to $418,700. In the prior quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 4.9%.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South registered the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (45.1%) in the third quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 0.8%. Prices also increased 7.8% in the Northeast, 4.3% in the Midwest and 1.8% in the West.</p><p>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year median price increases, which can be influenced by the types of homes sold during the quarter, all experienced gains of at least 10.6%. Four of the markets were in Illinois. Overall, those markets were Racine, WI (13.7%); Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA. (13.1%); Syracuse, NY (13.0%); Peoria, IL (12.4%); Springfield, IL (12.3%); Burlington-South Burlington, VT (11.7%); Shreveport-Bossier City, LA (11.5%); Rockford, IL (11.1%); Decatur, IL (10.9%); and Norwich-New London, CT (10.6%).</p><p>Eight of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Overall, those markets were San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($1,900,000; 2.7%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,398,500; 7.2%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,309,000; 0.7%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,138,000; 7.2%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($1,010,000; 3.2%); Salinas, CA ($959,800; 1.5%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($949,800; 6.7%); Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($947,500; 5.6%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($947,400; 2.8%); and Boulder, CO ($832,200; -3.0%).</p><p>Nearly 13% of markets (29 of 226) experienced home price declines in the third quarter, up from almost 10% in the second quarter.</p><p>Housing affordability slightly improved in the third quarter as mortgage rates trended lower. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,137, down 5.5% from the second quarter ($2,262) and 2.4%—or $52—from one year ago. Families typically spent 25.2% of their income on mortgage payments, down from 26.9% in the prior quarter and 27.1% one year ago.</p><p>“Housing affordability has been a challenge, but the worst appears to be over,” Yun said. “Rising wages are outpacing home price increases. Despite some short-term swings, mortgage rates are set to stabilize below last year’s levels. More inventory is reaching the market and providing additional options for consumers.”</p><p>First-time buyers found marginally better affordability conditions compared to the previous quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $355,900 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment declined to $2,097, down 5.5% from the prior quarter ($2,218). That was a decrease of $49, or 2.3%, from one year ago ($2,146). First-time buyers typically spent 38% of their family income on mortgage payments, down from 40.6% in the previous quarter.</p><p>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down payment mortgage in 42.5% of markets, down from 48% in the prior quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 2.2% of markets, down from 2.7% in the previous quarter.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/11/2024-q3-metro-areas-with-largest-percent-gain-in-existing-single-family-home-price-infographic-11-07-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-q3-metro-areas-with-largest-percent-gain-in-existing-single-family-home-price-infographic-11-07-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/2024-q3-metro-areas-with-largest-percent-gain-in-existing-single-family-home-price-infographic-11-07-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/11/2024-q3-metro-areas-with-largest-percent-gain-in-existing-single-family-home-price-infographic-11-07-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—Realtors and real estate professionals from across the New York metro region and the United States gathered earlier this month at the Fordham University Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan for the 18th Annual Regional Global Real Estate Summit.</p><p>This year’s two-day program (Nov. 4-5), was highlighted by a full day of informative presentations and roundtables on Nov. 5 covering a host of global issues, including marketing and digital media, visas, global real estate trends, remote work opportunities, the outlook for the New York metro region’s economy and global investment and Real Estate Proptech.</p><p>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez kicked off day two of the Global Summit saying: “This event is the cornerstone of our commitment to providing our members, but also our foreign delegates and cooperating associations, global partners and colleagues with a world of opportunity. In today’s inter-connected market, understanding global trends and building international relationships is essential to every real estate professional.”</p><p>This year’s Global Real Estate Summit was a collaboration of more than 12 national, state and regional Realtor associations. The Global Association participants were the National Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors. The host associations were: Connecticut Realtors, Greenwich (CT) Association of Realtors, Brooklyn MLS, North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, Canadian Real Estate Association, Long Island Board of Realtors, Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, Greater Bergen Realtors, Staten Island Board of Realtors and Miami Realtors. In addition, the Liberty (NJ) Board of Realtors was a supporting association for the event.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/11/GLOBAL-SUMMIT-BOOKLET.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1599" height="1068" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/GLOBAL-SUMMIT-BOOKLET.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/GLOBAL-SUMMIT-BOOKLET.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/11/GLOBAL-SUMMIT-BOOKLET.jpg 1599w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Tony D’Anzica, Global Real Estate Summit Co-Chair and former HGAR President was heartened by the increase in Realtor association participation in the 2024 Global Real Estate Summit and noted that the event could now boast “the largest collaboration of Realtor associations in the United States.”</p><p>He added, “As our industry faces unprecedented challenges, local associations will be expected to do much more to validate their value proposition. Nothing reflects the value we provide to our members more than the unity and cooperation that you see between our (more than) 10 associations right now. It has become a hallmark and it has become our greatest collective achievement.”</p><p>One of the highlights of the program was a very positive outlook on the region’s economy by participants in the “Economic Development Panel.” Moderated by Business Council of Westchester President and CEO Dr. Marsha Gordon, the panel included: Melissa Román Burch, COO, New York City Economic Development Corp.; and Matt Pugliese, executive director, community development, Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development.</p><p>“New York City is at a really interesting point in its economic growth and evolution,” Burch said. “We are firmly out of the Covid recovery period and very much into job growth and industry growth.</p><p>In fact, New York City recently achieved a new record in the history of New York City when it reached the 4,7 million jobs threshold. Burch noted that New York City lost 1 million jobs in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said the new jobs record “highlights the engine of the city and the economic resiliency and diversity of its industries that have enabled this broad-based recovery to come to this point.”</p><p>She said the growth sectors in the city include AI, Life Sciences and the Green Economy with a focus on Offshore Wind. Burch said that the city is focused on growing international investment and part of the record job growth has been fueled by global investment.</p><p>“New York City remains a top market of investment for international groups,” she said, noting that the city has been successful in securing international investment in housing, office and industrial real estate projects.</p><p>Dr. Gordon noted that life sciences is a major driver of new jobs in Westchester County, including the significant growth in Westchester and the Capitol Region by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/11/D-ANZICA-SPEAKS-AT-GLOBAL-SUMMIT.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1069" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/D-ANZICA-SPEAKS-AT-GLOBAL-SUMMIT.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/D-ANZICA-SPEAKS-AT-GLOBAL-SUMMIT.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/11/D-ANZICA-SPEAKS-AT-GLOBAL-SUMMIT.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Global Real Estate Summit Co-Chair Tony D’Anzica said the event attracted the most Realtor association participation of any event in the United States.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Burch also discussed the movement to rezone certain sections of the city that will enable the conversion of office properties to housing and highlighted a number of new laws that should spur new development and domestic and foreign investment in the city.</p><p>Connecticut’s Pugliese noted that the state recently registered its third consecutive year of positive population growth. State government has posted record surpluses that have allowed the state to invest in a total of 600 capital projects that are currently in the pipeline.</p><p>Both Burch and Pugliese said that New York City and Connecticut are working to address housing shortages. New York City has a goal of adding 500,000 units of housing, while Pugliese highlighted Electric Boat’s and General Dynamics’ aim of hiring more than 5,000 new workers and the need to develop housing for those workers in the New London region.</p><p>Other highly informative presentations at the Global Real Estate Summit were:</p><p>“Marketing &amp; Digital Media” presented by Ines Hegedus-Garcia, executive vice president, Avanti Way Realty;</p><p>Key Note Address: “Global Success” by Jorge Guerra, president, CEO, Real Estate Sales Force;</p><p>“Visa &amp; Global Real Estate Trends” by Russell Rigs, director, environmental and sustainability policy/advocacy group, National Association of Realtors;</p><p>“The Future is Here—Realtors &amp; the Reality of Remote Work Opportunities” by Mike Cobb, president and CEO, Real Estate Sales Force;</p><p>“Real Estate Proptech” moderated by Christina Prostano, associate real estate broker, CP Global Team, Compass New York, panelists: Alina Aeby, founder/president, Silicon Valley Association, NAR Global Coordinator for Eastern Europe; Amy Polvado, founder and CEO, Facilimax; and Andrew Ackerman, strategic advisor, head of REACH Labs for Second Century Ventures and</p><p>“NAR Global Update” by Stephanie Aker, NAR Global.</p><p>The sponsors for the Global Real Estate Summit were: ShowingTime, OneKey MLS, Realtor.com, GV Axxesories, SentriLock, Onsight, AyalaLand, Residential Real Estate Council, CRS (Certified Residential Specialist) and AppFolio.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“Mortgage rates in Trump’s first term (at 4%) were the good old days. Are we going to go back to 4%? Per my forecast, unfortunately, we will not. It’s more likely that we’ll go back to 6%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BOSTON—The worst of the housing inventory shortage is coming to an end, mortgage rates are stabilizing and job additions are continuing, according to NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.</p><p>Yun analyzed the current state of the U.S. residential real estate market and shared his 2025-2026 outlook on Nov. 8 during the Residential Economic Issues and Trends Forum at 2024 NAR NXT, The REALTOR Experience, in Boston.</p><p>“Over the years, you see your past clients doing well, because they’re homeowners,” explained Yun. “There’s an intangible value that [Realtors] provide. 2024 has been a very difficult year on many fronts. We did not get the home sales recovery this year after an awful 2023.”</p><p>However, Yun explained that household equity in real estate is at a record high. This means there has been a huge increase in wealth for Realtors’ past clients, to the tune of $35 trillion. Yun highlighted the glaring difference in estimated median net worth between homeowners ($415,000) and renters ($10,000) in 2024.</p><p>“Homeowners’ wealth steadily rises while renters’ wealth does not,” said Yun. “If you don’t enter the housing market, you are in the renter class where wealth is not being accumulated. If you want to participate in the housing market, the sooner you get in, the sooner you accumulate wealth.”</p><p>Yun also highlighted that the homeownership rate is much lower among younger Americans, and first-time home buyers are having trouble entering the market.</p><p>Yun pointed out that US job gains since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) have led to record-high payroll employment as of September 2024.</p><p>“When more people work, they have the capacity or they’re in a better position to buy a home,” stated Yun.</p><p>Yun explained to the room of Realtors that, “Home sales depend mainly on jobs and mortgage rates.”</p><p>Regarding whether we are going to see an acceleration of job growth, Yun stated, “The stock market is very optimistic.”</p><p>Yun addressed mortgage rates during a second Donald Trump presidency, saying, “Mortgage rates in his first term (at 4%) were the good old days. Are we going to go back to 4%? Per my forecast, unfortunately, we will not. It’s more likely that we’ll go back to 6%. That will be the new normal, bouncing around 5.5%-6.5%.”</p><p>Yun said we can expect six-to-eight more interest rate cuts. He also gave advice to the chair of the Federal Reserve on when to make these cuts: “My advice to Jerome Powell: do it in January, rather than December.”</p><p>Yun expects there will be four different rounds of rate cuts in 2025. He also addressed the budget deficit.</p><p>“Today, we have a massive budget deficit at a time when we are not in an economic recession,” explained Yun. “Clearly president-elect Trump will not stop tax cuts—he will extend or expand them.”</p><p>Yun added, “There will be less mortgage money available because the government is borrowing so much money. However, if the Trump administration can lay out a credible plan to reduce the budget deficit, then mortgage rates can move downward.”</p><p>He also explained that another way to address the budget deficit is to bring down the price of housing.</p><p>“We have to have more supply,” said Yun. “Per our advocacy efforts, we’re trying everything we can to boost supply.”</p><p>Yun noted that 2023 was difficult for existing-home sales and 2024 looks to be the same. However, he flagged that we did get an increase in pending home sales in September and provided his forecast for existing-home sales.</p><p>“Maybe the worst is coming to an end,” added Yun. “Directionally, I think there’s going to be roughly a 10% boost of existing-home sales in 2025 and 2026.”</p><p>Yun projects new home sales to be 11% higher in 2025 and 8% higher in 2026. Yun forecasts the median home price to be 2% higher in both 2025 and 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Despite representing different parties, Latimer and Lawler share a bipartisan focus on housing policy solutions. Both have expressed support for raising the cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the whirlwind 2024 election season concludes, the dust is beginning to settle on a year that has reshaped the political landscape locally and nationally. While presidential and congressional races often dominate headlines, New York saw several pivotal outcomes that directly impact Realtor priorities, especially in housing affordability and policy. </p><p>In Westchester County’s 16th Congressional District, George Latimer, the Westchester County Executive achieved victory over incumbent Congressman Jamaal Bowman back in the spring primaries. After that contentious and record-breaking Democratic primary, Latimer’s easy general election win marks a shift in representation for this district. Notably, Latimer’s politically moderate track record includes spearheading the 2019 Westchester County Housing Needs Assessment, positioning him as a key ally for addressing the region’s affordability crisis.</p><p>Next door, in the 17th Congressional District, Republican Congressman Mike Lawler successfully defended his seat against former Representative Mondaire Jones in one of the nation’s most-watched races. This contest attracted national attention and significant financial backing, including strong support from the National Association of Realtors. </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY– OneKey MLS reported data earlier today (Nov. 19) for October 2024 reflecting continued strength in the housing market with higher-value transactions despite market and interest rate volatility.</p><p>In October, the regional single-family closed median sale price was $706,000, marking an 8.6% year-over-year increase from $650,000 in October 2023. OneKey MLS’ market area includes: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange and Sullivan counties in the Hudson Valley, as well as the Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties.</p><p>OneKey reported that the closed median sale price of condominiums of $500,000, reflecting no change from the same price reported a year ago. The closed median sale price for co-ops was $285,000, a 1.7% decrease from $290,000 in October 2023.</p><p>In terms of transactional activity, closed sales for single-family homes were up compared to last year while condominiums and co-ops were down. There were 3,335 single-family closed transactions in October 2024, a 3% increase from October 2023.

Looking forward, we anticipate that while monthly variances may continue, the broader trend of gradual annual growth will persist, backed by strong market fundamentals.”</p><p>OneKey MLS, the largest MLS in New York State, is a subsidiary of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the Long Island Board of Realtors. It aggregates the real estate transactional data from the counties making up the regional MLS service area, and reports individually on each county therein.

Year-over-year, sales progressed 2.9% (up from 3.85 million in October 2023).</p><p>“The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important. While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of October was 1.37 million units, up 0.7% from September and 19.1% from one year ago (1.15 million).

All four U.S. regions registered price increases.</p><p>“The ongoing price gains mean increasing wealth for homeowners nationwide,” Yun added. “Additional inventory and more home building activity will help price increases moderate next year.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 29 days in October, up from 28 days in September and 23 days in October 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 27% of sales in October, up from 26% in September but down from 28% in October 2023.

    <description><![CDATA[The real estate industry has expressed concerns regarding the potential repercussions of the FARE Act.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Nov. 13, 2024, the New York City Council passed the “Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act” (FARE Act) [<u>see</u> Introduction Bill No. 360-A at <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3Zgcl7W">https://on.nyc.gov/3Zgcl7W</a>]. The FARE Act will require any individual who engages a real estate agent in a residential real estate rental transaction to be responsible for paying that agent’s fees. Landlords will no longer be permitted to charge broker fees to tenants for the landlord’s broker. It has long been the custom in New York City for tenants to pay the broker’s fee in connection with a lease, even if the broker was engaged by a landlord. The FARE Act will go into effect 180 days after it becomes law.</p><h3 id="proponents-of-the-fare-act">Proponents of the FARE Act</h3><p>The City Council passed the FARE Act by a 42-8 vote, which makes the legislation veto-proof and able to withstand any potential veto by Mayor Eric Adams. The legislation requires that landlords, rather than tenants, pay any broker fees when the broker represents the landlord’s interests. Those who voted in favor of the legislation argue that it brings New York City in line with standard practices observed in other parts of the country, where landlords typically cover broker fees. Councilmember Chi Ossé, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized that the legislation aims to address the city’s housing crisis by eliminating what he described as a “cruel and archaic” practice. The proponents of the FARE Act believe that it will significantly reduce housing costs, thereby increasing housing availability and accessibility to more affordable housing.</p><h3 id="opponents-of-the-fare-act">Opponents of the FARE Act</h3><p>The real estate industry has expressed concerns regarding the potential repercussions of the FARE Act. Critics, including the Real Estate Board of New York and the New York State Association of Realtors, warn that landlords will likely offset the additional costs by increasing monthly rents, which will inevitably lead to higher costs and will negatively affect the intended benefits for tenants. According to <em>The Real Deal </em>[<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZchBJQ">https://bit.ly/3ZchBJQ</a>], REBNY’s President, Jim Whelan, stated that “REBNY will continue to pursue all options to fight against this harmful legislation on behalf of our members and the renters they serve.”<br><br>NYSAR, in its Call-For-Action – Stop the FARE Act [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3CKKTq6">https://bit.ly/3CKKTq6</a>]—urged its members to contact their local Council Members and urge them to “vote NO on this misguided legislation that threatens brokers’ livelihoods, lead[s] to increased rents, and limit[s] housing access.” NYSAR pointed out that “this legislation will undoubtedly lead to higher rents for tenants and limit housing access.” NYSAR also points out that the FARE Act will:</p><ul>
<li>Restrict Dual Agency;</li>
<li>Empower New York City agencies to issue fines on real estate licensees and landlords;</li>
<li>Assume that any broker advertising an open listing rental unit works for and is being paid by the landlord;</li>
<li>Allow a tenant to sue a broker over a purported violation;</li>
<li>Would prohibit landlords from paying the fee for a tenant’s broker, and</li>
<li>Result in higher rents for tenants.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <em>New York Post</em> article [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4hTwLLx">https://bit.ly/4hTwLLx</a>], it was reported that “Mayor Eric Adams also expressed skepticism about the legislation, suggesting to reporters… that there was nothing preventing a property owner from passing on the expense to the renter on the lease.” The <em>Associated Press</em> also pointed out that Mayor Eric Adams, who was also formerly a real estate broker, “has raised concerns about the legislation and possible unintended consequences.” According to the AP, Mayor Adams was quoted as stating that “sometimes our ideas are not fleshed out enough to know what are the full long-term ramifications.”</p><h3 id="the-basic-requirements-restrictions-of-the-fare-act">The Basic Requirements &amp; Restrictions of the FARE Act</h3><p><br><em>Liability of Landlord and Landlord’s Agent</em><br><br>Landlord’s agents, under Subsection a.1. of Section 20-699.21 of the FARE Act, are expressly prohibited from “impos[ing] any fee on, or collect[ing] any fee from, a tenant related to the rental of residential real property….” Subdivision a.2. also prohibits “any agent who publishes a listing for a rental of residential real property with the permission or authorization of the landlord for such property” from imposing or collecting a fee from a tenant.<br><br>The FARE Act also extends liability to a landlord under subsection b. if “1. a landlord’s agent of such landlord violates such subdivision [a]; or 2. any agent who publishes a listing for a rental of residential real property with the permission or authorization of such landlord violates such subdivision.” Additionally, under subdivision c. a landlord and landlord’s agent are prohibited from making it a condition of any rental agreement that a tenant engage any agent, including a dual agent. Again, this would restrict the use of dual agency, which is expressly permitted by New York State law.<br><br><em>Rebuttable Presumption: Posting of A Listing for Residential Real Property</em><br><br>Subdivision d. provides that “No person shall post a listing for the rental of residential real property that represents that fees must be paid in a manner that would violate this section.” Under subdivision e. “There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an agent who publishes a listing for a rental of residential real property does so with the permission or authorization of the landlord of such property.” Therefore, if an agent lists a property and that agent is not working for nor has been engaged by a landlord, the law presumes that the agent is doing so with the authorization and/or permission of the landlord. The onus would then be on the landlord to establish that the agent did not act with the permission or authorization of the landlord.<br><br><em>Expansive Definition of Residential Real Property</em><br><br>The FARE Act defines “residential real property” as any “dwelling unit, as defined in paragraph 13 of subdivision a of section 27-2004, including a dwelling unit held in the condominium or cooperative forms of ownership.” It is important to note that Section 27-2004, subsection a, paragraph 13 of the NYC Housing Maintenance Code [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3Vo1qHl">https://bit.ly/3Vo1qHl</a>] includes in the definition of a “dwelling unit” as an “accommodation in a multiple dwelling or private dwelling.” In essence, the FARE Act applies to all forms of real property (i.e., private dwellings consisting of 1-2 family dwellings as well as multiple dwellings consisting of three or more families).<br><br><em>“Total Fee Disclosure” to a Tenant</em></p><p>Section 20-699.22 further requires that all fees be disclosed to a tenant in advance in any listing for the subject property. Under subsection a. “[e], every listing related to the rental of residential real property shall disclose in such listing in a clear and conspicuous manner any fee to be paid by the prospective tenant for the rental of such property.”<br><br>Therefore, all fees must be disclosed in a “clear and conspicuous” (e.g., bold type font, italicized, etc.) manner in the listing.<br><br>Subdivision b. further requires that “Prior to the execution of an agreement for the rental of residential real property, the landlord or landlord’s agent shall provide to the tenant an itemized written disclosure of any fees that the tenant must pay to the landlord or to any other person at the direction of the landlord in connection with such rental.” It is also important to note that any fees are subject to the restrictions relating to the fees a landlord may charge under subdivision 1 of Section 238-a of the Real Property Law, which was passed in 2019 as part of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4eG7jX4">https://bit.ly/4eG7jX4</a>].<br><br>The written disclosure must include “a short description of each fee” being charged and the tenant must sign the written disclosure before signing any lease or rental agreement for the residential real property. The landlord or landlord’s agent is also required to retain the signed and written disclosure for three (3) years and shall also provide a copy to the tenant.</p><h3 id="tenant%E2%80%99s-private-cause-of-action-liability-and-penalties-of-landlords-and-agents">Tenant’s Private Cause of Action, Liability and Penalties of Landlords and Agents</h3><p>Under Section 20-699.23 of the FARE Act, any person who violates the provisions of section 20-699.21, with respect to the fees charged to a tenant, will be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for the first violation, and not more than $2,000 for any subsequent violation that occurs within a two-year period. If any person violates the provisions of section 20-699.22, relating to the required written disclosures, that person will be subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 for the first violation and not more than $1,000 for each subsequent violation occurring within a two-year period.<br><br>The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be responsible for enforcing the provisions of the FARE Act. In any proceeding, the DCWP may seek an order imposing all applicable civil penalties authorized by the FARE Act and it can also require restitution of any impermissible fees charged by a landlord or landlord’s agent.<br><br>Additionally, Section 20-699.24 also allows a tenant the right to commence a private cause of action against a landlord or landlord’s agent. Any person alleging a violation of this subchapter may “file civil action, in accordance with applicable law, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such court may order compensatory, injunctive and declaratory relief.”</p><h3 id="the-effects-of-the-fare-act-on-the-real-estate-market-in-nyc">The Effects of the FARE Act on the Real Estate Market In NYC</h3><p>As the FARE Act moves toward implementation, stakeholders will closely monitor its impact on the rental market, housing affordability, and the dynamics between landlords, tenants, and real estate professionals. The legislation represents a pivotal shift in New York City’s approach to rental transactions, with the potential to influence housing policies beyond New York City. The Commissioner of the DCWP is required to establish an outreach and education campaign for real estate brokers, agents, tenants, prospective tenants and other members of the public who may be affected by the FARE Act. While there is still some time before the FARE Act goes into effect, brokers, agents, landlords and tenants need to be prepared for its implementation. One thing is clear, there will likely be opposition to the FARE Act in the coming months by those who firmly believe that this will hurt, rather than help, the market and prospective tenants.<br><br><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KANSAS CITY, MO—A little over a year ago, the real estate industry was shaken to its core when an eight-person jury in the U.S. District Court in Western District of Missouri found that the National Association of Realtors and two co-defendants liable in the federal <em>Sitzer/Burnett</em> trial, which challenged MLS rules and the real estate compensation model. The jury verdict on Oct. 31, 2023, of $1.78 billion under federal law could have been trebled to more than $5 billion.<br><br>Yesterday, Nov. 26, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri granted final approval of the National Association of Realtors’ proposed $418-million settlement agreement reached in March 2024 to resolve the class action claims related to broker commissions. The ruling could finally put the matter “in the rearview mirror” after NAR agreed to practice changes to settle the case that covered the Missouri markets of Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield and Columbia but had national implications.<br><br>NAR officials noted yesterday that the court heard from all parties as well as objectors and the Department of Justice. Once arguments concluded, the court quickly ruled to grant final approval. The court is expected to issue a formal written order of the ruling soon.<br><br>The settlement secures a release of liability for more than 1.4 million NAR members, all state/territorial and local Realtor associations, Realtor Multiple Listing Services (MLSs), NAR’s affiliate organizations and all brokerages with an NAR member as principal that had a residential transaction volume in 2022 of $2 billion or below. The settlement also releases MLSs and brokerages that chose to opt-in to the agreement.<br><br>“This is an important moment for NAR members, home buyers and sellers, and the real estate industry,” said NAR President Kevin Sears, broker-associate of Sears Real Estate/Lamacchia Realty of Springfield, MA. “As consumer champions, NAR’s members have been working tirelessly to implement the practice changes required by the settlement and shepherd consumers through this period of transition. The principles of transparency, competition and choice are core to the settlement agreement and empower real estate professionals and consumers to negotiate the services and compensation that work for them.”<br><br>NAR CEO Nykia Wright said, “NAR is committed to empowering Realtors to help home buyers and sellers successfully navigate what is often the most important financial transaction of their lives. Today and every day, NAR is focused on demonstrating the importance of agents who are Realtors in the marketplace, creating a transparent and inclusive home buying and selling process, and advancing the right to real property for all.”<br><br>Under the settlement, NAR will pay $418 million over approximately four years to the settlement fund. Membership dues for 2025 will remain unchanged from 2024.<br><br>NAR President Sears, in a<sup> </sup>meeting with HGAR leaders in White Plains on Oct. 7, 2024, said that if the settlement was approved, NAR would likely make the first payment in connection with the settlement—approximately $197 million—sometime during the first quarter of 2025. He said the funds would come out of NAR’s reserves.<br><br>He related that in 2026, 2027 and 2028, NAR will pay approximately $72 million each year to satisfy the settlement.<br><br>“If approved (by the court) on Nov. 26, we can finally put this in our rearview mirror,” Sears said at the HGAR meeting.<br><br>Yesterday, in an e-mail, NAR President Sears noted that “NAR’s goal throughout this process was to protect as many NAR members and their businesses; state, local, and territorial associations of Realtors; and multiple listing services as possible while preserving choice for consumers in their approach to buying or selling a home. The principles of transparency, competition, and choice are core to the settlement agreement and empower real estate professionals and consumers to negotiate the services and compensation that work for them. Preserving this optionality, including whether to offer compensation, is important to NAR’s efforts to support first-time homebuyers and buyers from marginalized communities.”<br><br>He continued, “With this step behind us, NAR members must remain focused on implementing the practice changes and helping consumers navigate the new landscape. NAR and its membership must all continue to communicate and demonstrate the unique value of Realtors today and every day.”<br><br>While the commission case is settled, NAR’s issues with the U.S. Justice Department appear to remain unresolved. In a court filing on Nov. 24, the U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division stated, “The United States continues to scrutinize policies and practices in the residential real estate industry that may stifle competition. It is a matter of public record that the United States has an open investigation into these practices.”<br><br>The Justice Department later stated. “Because the United States did not participate in either this litigation or the proposed settlement, the proposed settlement does not limit the United States’ ability to enforce the antitrust laws, including to seek greater relief for the conduct at issue here.”<br><br>NAR released a statement in response to the DOJ’s filing, stating: “Based on our interpretation, the DOJ does not appear to be concerned about the use of written buyer agreements, as many states require these agreements as a matter of law. Rather, the DOJ seems to take issue with the practice change that requires the use of written buyer agreements as a part of the settlement. The DOJ’s filing, however, lacks specificity, and this is our best understanding with the information we have available. NAR fully disagrees with the DOJ’s position and stands behind written buyer agreements as a tool to create transparency and empower consumer choice in residential real estate transactions.”<br><br>More information about the practice changes in the settlement agreement can be found at <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/nar-settlement-faqs#realestate">NAR Settlement FAQs</a>. NAR officials stated that its 1.5 million members must adhere to the practice changes in good faith to maintain released status under the settlement agreement. NAR strongly opposes any attempts to circumvent the settlement.<br><br>For complete information about the settlement and the approval order once available, please visit <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts">facts.realtor</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales increased in October—the third consecutive month of increases, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>All four major U.S. regions experienced month-over-month gains in transactions, with the Northeast leading the way with a 4.7% increase from September’s pending transactions.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA, CA—Broader economic factors are expected to have a larger impact on the housing market than potential new federal policies in 2025, according to the “Realtor.com 2025 Housing Forecast released today. Realtor.com's forecast predicts home sale prices will grow by 3.7%, mortgage rates will stay above 6% and rents will remain virtually unchanged (-0.1%).</p><p>Growth in inventory with single-family home starts expected to grow 13.8% and existing for-sale home inventory expected to grow by 11.7%, which will help bring the first balanced market in nine years. Realtor.com predicts the New York metro region will see 11% home sales growth next year and a 5.9%% bump up in sales prices.</p><p>“While President-elect Trump can work quickly with his administration to implement some regulatory changes, other policies that will affect housing, such as tax changes and broad deregulation, require the cooperation of other branches and levels of government,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist, Realtor.com. “The size and direction of a Trump bump will depend on what campaign proposals ultimately become policy and when. For now, we expect a gradual improvement in housing market dynamics powered by broader economic factors. The new administration's policies have the potential to enhance or hamper the housing recovery, and the details will matter.”</p><p>In 2025, Realtor.com forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:</p><ul>
<li>Average mortgage rates of 6.3%, with rates edging down over the year to reach 6.2% by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Home prices will grow by 3.7% continuing growth trends since 2012.</li>
<li>Rents will remain about the same with a slight 0.1% drop.</li>
<li>A 11.7% increase in existing home inventory continuing the trend from 2024.</li>
<li>Single-family new home starts will grow an impressive 13.8%, reaching 1.1 million homes, a figure not seen since 2006.</li>
<li>Home sales will grow 1.5% year over year to 4.07 million</li>
<li>Months' supply, a key market balance indicator, is expected to improve from a 3.7-month average in 2024 to 4.1 months in 2025. Anything under 4 is typically considered a seller's market, while 4 to 6 months of supply is typically considered a balanced market.</li>

<h3 id="how-could-president-elect-trump%E2%80%99s-policies-impact-the-housing-forecast-in-2025">How Could President-Elect Trump’s Policies Impact the Housing Forecast in 2025?</h3><p>A Republican sweep of the presidency and both houses of Congress will likely result in pros and cons for the housing market. Among President Trump's proposals to address the housing shortage is making more federal land available for homebuilding and addressing regulation, which estimates suggest contributes to more than $90,000 of the cost of a new home, and could help bolster supply. Post election, markets have generally pushed longer-term rates higher, anticipating either higher inflation, larger deficits, stronger economic growth or some combination.</p><h3 id="what-should-buyers-and-sellers-expect-in-2025">What Should Buyers and Sellers Expect in 2025?</h3><p>Overall buyers and sellers should expect to see a more balanced market in 2025, which will require some give and take on both sides. Homebuyers frustrated by higher interest rates will have some buyer-friendly conditions in 2025, such as the highest for-sale inventory since December 2019 and nearly 20% of listings coming with price cuts. Mortgage rates are expected to improve slowly in 2025, but the drop likely won't move the needle back toward a seller's market. Buyers should expect a friendlier, less competitive housing market than in past years, although one that is still costly because of stubbornly high mortgage rates and home prices.</p><p>Limited inventory and strong demand in many areas could mean that sellers still have the upper hand in terms of negotiating prices, especially in desirable locations. However, higher interest rates or slower than expected income growth could lead to fewer buyers being able to afford homes, which might result in longer selling times or price reductions in some markets.</p><h3 id="key-trends-and-wildcards-to-watch-in-2025">Key Trends and Wildcards to Watch in 2025</h3><p><strong>Slight rebound in overall home sales</strong>—The 2025 forecast has home sales slightly increasing, with an expected annual count of sales to be 1.5% more than 2024, for an annual tally of 4.07 million sales. As mortgage rates ease back in 2025, the market is likely to see slightly more activity during the busier summer months, compared to last year.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/cd46e58e653514f992df802ea64c7292w-c992010485rd-w832_q80-2.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="832" height="619" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/cd46e58e653514f992df802ea64c7292w-c992010485rd-w832_q80-2.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/cd46e58e653514f992df802ea64c7292w-c992010485rd-w832_q80-2.jpg 832w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Mortgage rates</strong>—While markets are factoring in expectations of a higher-rate environment than previously thought, there is uncertainty around which policies will take priority and whether the specifics match or merely rhyme with campaign promises. These details will matter for the outlook and for mortgage rates.</p><p><strong>Rent prices will largely remain the same, more rental supply growth in the South</strong>—While the surge in new multifamily supply offers renters more options, the large renter population will dampen any significant impact on rental prices. The median asking rent in 2025 is expected to be only slightly lower than in 2024 (-0.1%). Looking ahead to 2025, recent construction trends suggest all four regions will see continued growth in rental stock, with the South leading at an annual increase rate of 1.5%, followed by the West (1.2%), Midwest (0.9%) and Northeast (0.7%). It is likely that Southern rental markets will maintain a relative affordability advantage in 2025.</p><p><strong>Big increases in both new home sales and new home starts</strong>—While existing home sales are expected to remain largely unchanged for the year in 2025, new home sales and single-family housing starts are expected to outperform. With a substantial construction deficit over the last decade, builders have room to run and may get an additional boost from a builder-friendly administration that understands the need for more construction. Single-family starts are expected to total 1.1 million in 2025, an impressive 13.8% pickup over 2024.</p><p>“While more inventory means buyers will likely have more time to make purchase decisions in 2025, in any market, a fast-acting buyer will have a higher likelihood of making the winning offer,” said Hale. “For this reason, it's wise to get prepared financially and for the home search overall. Thankfully for homebuyers there are more tools, like Realtor.com’s dynamic map layer, to help home buyers and sellers get ready."</p><p>When faced with an overwhelming amount of market information, Realtor.com's dynamic map layers can help consumers make better sense of it. These new map-based search features allow buyers and sellers to explore a wide range of neighborhood and home details with just a quick glance, such as home estimates, lot size, year built, sold price, sold price per sq ft, market hotness, climate factors and more.</p><p>For more information about the Realtor.com® 2025 housing forecast, visit: <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/2025-national-housing-forecast/">https://www.realtor.com/research/2025-national-housing-forecast/</a></p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/Realtor_com___infographic-2.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1569" height="2700" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/Realtor_com___infographic-2.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Realtor_com___infographic-2.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/Realtor_com___infographic-2.jpg 1569w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

This recognition is a testament to the incredible leadership, staff, and members of HGAR, whose dedication and support make the work I love possible.

    <description><![CDATA[Yun noted that a key trend going forward is that for-sale inventory has been increasing of late and is expected to continue next year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors held its annual Real Estate Forecast Summit yesterday and the consensus from industry economists that participated in the virtual program was conditions in the residential real estate markets will improve in some key areas in 2025.</p><p>National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun began the session by noting that the “worst is over” after the markets experienced difficult sales activity in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>He predicted that existing home sales will rise between 7% to 12% in 2025 and 10% to 15% in 2026. New home sales volume will rise 11% in 2025 and another 8% in 2026.</p><p>Sales price growth will slow down in the next two years with the median sale price increasing nationally by 2% each year. Yun noted that a key trend going forward is that for-sale inventory has been increasing of late and is expected to continue next year.</p><p>While the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates this month and in 2025, its impact will not be significant, the economists agreed. The nation’s estimated average rate (for the week ended Dec. 6) for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 6.67% from 6.69% the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. NAR’s Yun predicts that the average mortgage interest rate will be just above 6% in 2025 and will be at roughly the same level in 2026.</p><p>All agreed that there will be only marginal improvement in the current housing affordability crisis in 2025 as inventory levels continue to rise from record-low levels.</p><p>Yun predicted that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates once again at its meetings next week and in total will implement another four to six rate cuts in 2025.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/IMG_4790-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1385" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/IMG_4790-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/IMG_4790-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/12/IMG_4790-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/12/IMG_4790-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Source: National Association of Realtors</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Jessica Lutz, NAR Deputy Chief Economist and Vice President of Research, covered 2024 sales data and noted that 26% of primary residence sales involved all-cash transactions, which was an all-time high. In addition, the for-sale-by-owner or FSBO share of the market was just 6% overall in 2024.</p><p>“We know that high-income and high-equity homebuyers are really the winner in today’s housing market,” Lutz said. Realtor.com data also indicates that while first-time homebuyer income has increased over the past two years, the high cost of housing and low inventory are shutting out first responders, teachers, etc.</p><p>Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale agreed with Yun that sales will rise. She predicts a 1.5% increase in home sales in 2025 and that sales prices will rise, but at a slower pace than prior years. She noted that Fed rate cuts will not have a dramatic impact on long-term rates. She predicts that mortgage rates will fall to just above 6% and will average 6.3% in 2025. One positive for the market will be an increase in for-sale inventory, driven in part by new home construction.</p><p>“Despite the positives with inventory expected to rise, it is still going to be a challenging market for first-time homebuyers in part because availability will be stretched,” Hale said. Another impediment to increased first-time homebuyer activity will be that average rents are expected to be flat in 2025 and therefore “the short-term cost is very much in favor of renting. You have to think very long term for the financial benefits of homeownership to pay off given the cost structure today.” Hale said Realtor.com believes the homeownership rate will fall once again in 2025.</p><p>In terms of lending rate predictions, Robert Dietz, senior vice president and chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, expects rates to be “somewhat below 6%” by the start of 2026. Michael Fratantoni, Ph.D, Chief Economist, Senior Vice President, Research and Business Development for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said he believes rates will average a little below 6.5% in 2025. Fratantoni agreed with Yun and expects the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week, but believes the Fed will only cut rates three more times in 2025. He expects the U.S. economy to slow and the unemployment rate to rise in 2025.</p><p>Some great news for the mortgage industry, Fratantoni predicts mortgage origination volume will increase 20% in 2025. Home sale prices will rise 1.5% in 2025, while average rents will be flat as compared to this year. Fratantoni expects existing home sales to rise 5%, while new home sales will jump 10% in 2025.</p><p><em>Editor’s Note:</em> Check back with <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> for further coverage on predictions and perspectives on the national and local real estate markets in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales rose nearly 5% in November, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales advanced in three major U.S. regions and remained steady in the West. Year-over-year, sales climbed in all four regions.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—improved 4.8% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.15 million in November. Year-over-year, sales bounced 6.1% (up from 3.91 million in November 2023), according to data released by NAR on Dec. 19.</p><p>“Home sales momentum is building,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “More buyers have entered the market as the economy continues to add jobs, housing inventory grows compared to a year ago, and consumers get used to a new normal of mortgage rates between 6% and 7%.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of November was 1.33 million units, down 2.9% from October, but up 17.7% from one year ago (1.13 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.8-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 4.2 months in October but up from 3.5 months in November 2023.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in November was $406,100, up 4.7% from one year ago ($387,800). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><p>“Existing homeowners are capitalizing on the collective $15-trillion rise in housing equity over the past four years to look for homes better suited to their changing life circumstances,” Yun added.</p><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 32 days in November, up from 29 days in October and 25 days in November 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 30% of sales in November, up from 27% in October but down from 31% in November 2023. NAR's 2024 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released November 2024—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%, the lowest ever recorded.</p><p>Cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions in November, down from 27% in both October 2024 and November 2023.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 13% of homes in November, down from 17% in October and 18% in November 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in November, virtually unchanged from last month and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates">Mortgage Rates</h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.6% as of December 12. That's down from 6.69% one week earlier and 6.95% one year ago.</p><h3 id="single-family-and-condoco-op-sales">Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</h3><p>Single-family home sales progressed 5.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.76 million in November, up 7.4% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $410,900 in November, up 4.8% from November 2023.</p><p>Existing condominium and co-op sales increased 2.6% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 390,000 units, down 4.9% from one year ago (410,000). The median existing condo price was $359,800 in November, up 2.8% from the prior year ($350,100).</p><h3 id="regional-breakdown">Regional Breakdown</h3><p>Existing-home sales in the Northeast in November jumped 8.5% from October to an annual rate of 510,000, up 6.3% from November 2023. The median price in the Northeast was $475,500, up 9.9% from last year.</p><p>In the Midwest, existing-home sales grew 5.3% in November to an annual rate of 1 million, up 5.3% from the previous year. The median price in the Midwest was $302,000, up 7.3% from November 2023.</p><p>Existing-home sales in the South rose 5.6% from October to an annual rate of 1.87 million in November, up 3.3% from one year before. The median price in the South was $361,300, up 2.8% from one year earlier.</p><p>In the West, existing-home sales were unchanged in November at an annual rate of 770,000, up 14.9% from a year ago. The median price in the West was $628,200, up 4.0% from November 2023.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-11-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-19-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/2024-11-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-19-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-11-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-19-2024-1000w-1500h-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Fines issued by the DOS in these Consent Orders have ranged between $500 and $6,000. Brokers must carefully monitor all websites and social media pages of their associated licensees.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year has been one filled with unprecedented legal and market-changing developments. In 2024, the real estate industry dealt with the monumental NAR Settlement relating to commissions and allegations of anti-trust violations, the enactment of the statewide Good Cause Eviction Law, the amendment to the Property Condition Disclosure Act, changes to the definition of a “squatter,” the FARE Act, the Corporate Transparency Act, and the new Freelance Law. There have also been notable trends relating to increased DOS enforcement actions and fines against brokers and licensed salespersons.</p><h3 id="the-nar-settlement-is-approved-by-the-court">The NAR Settlement Is Approved by The Court</h3><p>On March 15, 2024, the National Association of Realtors proposed its settlement that would end the homeowner litigation known as the Sitzer/Burnett case related to broker commissions. The settlement would be applied globally to all similar national lawsuits filed or claims made by sellers. On Nov. 26, 2024, the court formally and finally approved the terms of the Settlement.</p><p>The Department of Justice, however, just days before the court was set to approve the settlement, interjected itself into the Sitzer/Burnett case for the first time, and filed a last-minute Statement of Interest. As reported in <em>Real Estate News</em> [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3VKEsu2">https://bit.ly/3VKEsu2</a>], the DOJ “asked that if the court approves the settlement, it should clarify that using these new NAR policies does not shield NAR or other potential defendants from future enforcement by the DOJ.” The DOJ’s Statement pointed out that the settlement “does not address whether the proposed settlement prevents and restrains current antitrust violations, remedies past violations, or contains revised policies and practices that comply with the antitrust laws….”</p><p>The DOJ also raised concerns about the new requirements relating to agreements that buyers and agents must enter into before showing a property, and took the position that these agreements “may harm buyers and limit how brokers compete for clients.” The court nevertheless approved the settlement as originally proposed and did not address any of the issues raised by the DOJ.</p><h3 id="review-of-dos-enforcement-actions">Review of DOS Enforcement Actions</h3><p>It is recommended that all real estate licensees monitor DOS enforcement actions and trends. Licensees should frequently review DOS consent orders and decisions issued by Administrative Law Judges relating to complaints and enforcement actions filed against licensees, as these decisions and orders provide invaluable insight as to some of the examples of the unlawful behavior and violations that licensees engage in and the enforcement trends.</p><p>According to S. Anthony Gatto, Esq., NYSAR’s General Counsel, a review of recent DOS Consent Orders issued in 2024 reveals that the DOS has been citing brokers and associated licensees for not including the required disclosures, namely the Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination Notice [<u>see</u> <a href="https://on.ny.gov/4iEnDL3">https://on.ny.gov/4iEnDL3</a>], the Broker Standard Operating Procedure [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4gEwN8B">https://bit.ly/4gEwN8B</a>], and Reasonable Accommodation/Modification Disclosure [<u>see</u> <a href="https://on.ny.gov/4gB9FYu">https://on.ny.gov/4gB9FYu</a>], on their website and social media pages.</p><p>All of these required notices need to be displayed prominently and conspicuously on the broker’s and agent’s home page and must be located “above the fold”—meaning that consumers should not be required to scroll down or click through several layers in order to access or locate these notices. Additional violations by agents included the use of improper license type or corporate titles and the use of improper team names. Fines issued by the DOS in these Consent Orders have ranged between $500 and $6,000. Brokers must carefully monitor all websites and social media pages of their associated licensees.</p><h3 id="good-cause-eviction">Good Cause Eviction</h3><p>On Apr. 20, 2024, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law, as part of the 2025 Budget, the Good Cause Eviction Law and accompanying notice requirements and procedural amendments [<u>see</u> <em>The Legal Corner</em> article<em> </em>at<em> </em><a href="https://bit.ly/49H3Pmi">https://bit.ly/49H3Pmi</a>]. The new law prohibits the eviction or removal of tenants from all housing accommodations without “good cause” as defined in the legislation. The Good Cause Eviction law automatically applied to New York City, however, other municipalities in New York State need to specifically “opt-in” and may make two modifications.</p><p>If the local law enacted by a municipality does not provide for a different monthly rent exemption amount or does not provide a different definition of “small landlord,” then the terms contained in the Good Cause Eviction Law would apply. Some of the municipalities that have adopted the Good Cause Eviction law include Albany, Kingston, Ithaca, Poughkeepsie, Beacon and Newburgh.</p><p>Landlords renting units subject to the Good Cause Eviction law are required to attach a specific notice [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4gH5TNe">https://bit.ly/4gH5TNe</a>] to any initial lease, lease renewal, default or arrears notice, and legally require documents indicating that the unit is subject to the good cause eviction law. If the unit is exempt, a landlord is required to identify each applicable exemption in the notice.</p><h3 id="the-amended-property-condition-disclosure-act">The Amended Property Condition Disclosure Act</h3><p>On Mar. 20, 2024, the amendment to the existing Property Condition Disclosure Act went into effect [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3VK4f5n">https://bit.ly/3VK4f5n</a>]. One of the main differences in the new PCDA is that there is no longer the option for a seller to provide a $500 credit and opt-out of delivering to a purchaser a completed Property Condition Disclosure Statement, which has been revised to include some additional items that require disclosure.</p><p>The completed PCDS is now required to be attached to the Contract of Sale and must be signed by both the seller and the buyer. One important note is that the obligations of seller and buyer agents have not changed and they are still required to timely (i.e., at first substantive contact) provide notice to their buyer and seller clients of their rights and obligations under Section 466 of the PCDA.</p><h3 id="changes-to-the-definition-of-a-%E2%80%98squatter%E2%80%99">Changes to the Definition of A ‘Squatter’</h3><p>Another important development in 2024 was the change to the definition of a “squatter” under Section 711 of the New York Real Property Actions and Procedure Law. Prior to this change, squatters, in most instances, would acquire the rights of tenants once they take illegal occupancy of a property, and owners would be required to initiate costly and lengthy eviction proceedings in order to remove a squatter and regain possession.</p><p>Section 711 of the RPAPL now specifically states that “a tenant shall not include a squatter.” It further provides that “a squatter is a person who enters onto or intrudes upon real property without the permission of the person entitled to possession, and continues to occupy the property without title, right or permission of the owner or owner's agent or a person entitled to possession.”</p><h3 id="an-update-regarding-the-nyc-fare-act">An Update Regarding the NYC FARE Act</h3><p>In November’s article, the <em>Legal Corner</em> reported on the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act (the “FARE Act”) which was passed by the New York City Council on Nov. 13, 2024 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://realestateindepth.com/legal-corner-nyc-passes-the-fare-act-and-restricts-the-payment-of-commissions-by-tenants/">NYC Passes the FARE Act</a>]. Under the FARE Act, it is presumed that the broker who advertises a rental has been hired by the landlord even if that is not the case and the landlord would have the burden to prove that the broker was not hired by the tenant. The FARE Act further provides that if the landlord advertises a property for rent, the tenant cannot be forced to pay the broker’s fee. On Dec. 17<sup>th</sup>, the Real Estate Board of New York, the New York State Association of Realtors and a number of other plaintiffs sued the City of New York to block the implementation of the FARE Act.</p><h3 id="important-update-to-the-corporate-transparency-act">Important Update to the Corporate Transparency Act</h3><p>In October’s article, <em>Legal Corner</em> reported on the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2024 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZWrPP4">https://bit.ly/3ZWrPP4</a>].&nbsp; Since that time, there have been several important developments. On Dec. 3rd, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary nationwide injunction enjoining the enforcement of the CTA. As a result, the CTA’s Jan. 1, 2025 deadline for “reporting entities” to file their BOI applications has been delayed pending a decision by the court. On Dec. 5th, the DOJ appealed the U.S. District Court’s decision to issue a nationwide injunction.&nbsp; On Dec. 13th, the DOJ filed an emergency motion with the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals requesting that the nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Corporate Transparency Act be stayed. On Dec. 23rd, a three-member panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the nationwide injunction and reinstated FINCEN’s BOI filing requirements.</p><p>However, on Dec. 26th, the full panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in a surprise ruling issued an order once again staying the previous nationwide injunction. Therefore, the BOI filing requirement is once again on hold until the full panel hears oral arguments. <em>Forbes </em>reported that the Appeals Court stated that “in order to preserve the constitutional status quo while the merits panel considers the parties' weighty substantive arguments, that part of the motions-panel order granting the government's motion to stay the district court's preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the CTA and the Reporting Rule is vacated.” [See <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/12/27/in-whiplash-maneuver-court-rules-beneficial-ownership-information-boi-reporting-requirements-are-on-hold/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/12/27/in-whiplash-maneuver-court-rules-beneficial-ownership-information-boi-reporting-requirements-are-on-hold/</a>]. Reporting companies that have not filed yet can wait to file, but must closely follow the progress of the pending appeal and be ready to file in case the BOI filing requirement is reinstated.</p><h3 id="the-new-freelance-law-went-into-effect-statewide-in-2024">The New Freelance Law Went into Effect Statewide in 2024</h3><p>The new ‘Freelance Isn’t Free Law” (“Freelance Law”) went into effect on Aug. 28, 2024 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S5026">NY State Senate Bill 2023-S5026</a>]. Prior to this new legislation, New York City had enacted a similar freelance law. The new law applies to all “freelance” workers and independent contractors, including licensed real estate brokers and salespersons. The Freelance Law requires that a written agreement be entered into between the parties and that a fully executed copy of the agreement must be provided to the “Freelance Worker” by the “Hiring Party.” NYSAR has now updated its standard independent contractor form to include all of the provisions required under the new law and has made it available to its members.</p><p>One important and noteworthy provision (Section 1413) protects the “freelance worker” from retaliatory actions by the “hiring party” and provides that “no hiring party [i.e., the broker or brokerage firm]…shall threaten, intimidate, discipline, harass, deny a work opportunity to, or discriminate against a freelance worker, or take any other action that penalizes a freelance worker for exercising any right guaranteed under this article, or from obtaining any future work opportunity because the freelance worker has done so.”</p><h3 id="what-a-2024-what%E2%80%99s-in-store-for-2025">What a 2024! What’s In Store for 2025?</h3><p>This past year in the real estate industry has been one for the ages. There have been more developments in the real estate industry in 2024 than in almost any other year in recent history. The changes in 2024 are substantial and real estate agents, attorneys and other industry professionals need to take it all in. While it is not easy for real estate agents to keep up with all of these significant changes, they should take advantage of the support and informational resources provided to them by HGAR, NYSAR, and NAR. It is also important for brokers and agents to reach out to their own attorneys for guidance when they are not sure what to do. There are simply too many legal requirements, and trying to keep track of everything will be nearly impossible.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales gained 2.2% in November—the fourth consecutive month of increases and the highest level since February 2023, according to data released today (Dec. 30) by the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>The Midwest, South and West experienced month-over-month gains in transactions, while the Northeast decreased. Year-over-year, contract signings increased in all four U.S. regions, with the West leading the pack.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—advanced 2.2% to 79.0 in November. Year-over-year, pending transactions improved 6.9%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“Consumers appeared to have recalibrated expectations regarding mortgage rates and are taking advantage of more available inventory,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Mortgage rates have averaged above 6% for the past 24 months. Buyers are no longer waiting for or expecting mortgage rates to fall substantially. Furthermore, buyers are in a better position to negotiate as the market shifts away from a seller’s market.”</p><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI fell 1.3% from last month to 67.8, up 5.6% from November 2023. The Midwest index increased 0.4% to 78.1 in November, up 1.6% from the previous year.</p><p>The South PHSI improved 5.2% to 94.5 in November, up 8.5% from a year ago. The West index rose by 0.5% from the prior month to 64.3, up 11.8% from November 2023.</p><p>“It appears that some markets will outperform, driven primarily by local job gains and the flow of new inventory supply,” Yun explained.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/NAR-November-202024-PHS-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/NAR-November-202024-PHS-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2024/12/NAR-November-202024-PHS-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2024 in the real estate sector was highlighted by controversy and radical change on the national level as the National Association of Realtors reacted to scandal and later announced a landmark $418-million settlement in the broker-commission litigation. For the remainder of the year, the industry learned and implemented practice changes mandated by the settlement.</p><p>On the state and local levels, the real estate industry coped with high demand, low inventory and volatile interest rates as the Federal Reserve tried to battle inflation, which by the end of the year included three rate cuts with promises of several more in 2025.</p><p>The first major change in 2024 on an association basis was the conversion of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> from a print publication to an all-digital format and the launch of realestateindepth.com. HGAR, which had published a monthly print news publication since 1926, decided that its membership required more timely news delivery and heralded the new platform as “more robust, intuitive, versatile, and cost-effective.” HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez stated in her December 2023 column: “Most importantly, it will allow our members and subscribers the ability to better access and leverage the content and information to use with contacts and clients.”</p><p>The following are some of the major news stories covered in <em>Real Estate In-Depth </em>(<a href="https://realestateindepth.com/">https://realestateindepth.com/</a>) in 2024.</p><h3 id="january-2024">January 2024</h3><ul>

<p>Developments in the ongoing fallout from sexual harassment allegations leveled against former NAR President Kenny Parcell took a surprising turn when NAR President Tracy Kasper resigned on Jan. 8 over a blackmail threat she received to disclose a “past personal, non-financial matter unless she compromised her position at NAR.” (see <a href="https://realestateindepth.com/breaking-news-nar-president-kasper-resigns-over-blackmail-threat-sears-takes-over-as-association-president-immediately/">https://realestateindepth.com/breaking-news-nar-president-kasper-resigns-over-blackmail-threat-sears-takes-over-as-association-president-immediately/</a>).

The California Insurance Commissioner [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4ji1wKA">https://bit.ly/4ji1wKA</a>] has at least provided some short-term protections for homeowners by implementing a one-year moratorium and ban on cancellations and non-renewals in the affected areas.</p><p>However, this temporary action will likely not stop large nationwide companies from raising rates or from leaving this and other markets entirely. The New York Post reported in April 2024 [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40uXzLo">https://bit.ly/40uXzLo</a>] that California “which has seen costs soar due to natural disasters like wildfires, has had seven of its top 12 home insurers—including Farmers Insurance, State Farm and Allstate—pause or restrict coverage, saying they can’t afford to take on new clients.”</p><h3 id="nar-provides-guidance-regarding-insurance-coverage">NAR Provides Guidance Regarding Insurance Coverage</h3><p>It is important for real estate agents, attorneys, and other real estate professionals to be familiar with the issues involving homeowner’s insurance and to advise their buyer clients of the many issues relating to same. The National Association of Realtors recently made available the “Consumer Guide: Homeowners Insurance” (“Guidance”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4jdBDMa">https://bit.ly/4jdBDMa</a>], which practitioners should utilize and provide to their buyer clients when they are first engaged. As NAR’s Guidance explains, “Homeowners insurance covers you for unexpected losses at your home or property. It can include provisions to repair or rebuild the property, replace assets within the home, cover accidents that happen to you or someone else on the property, or even pay for living expenses if a covered incident forces you to live elsewhere temporarily.”</p><h3 id="purchasing-property-on-an-%E2%80%98all-cash%E2%80%99-basis">Purchasing Property on an ‘All Cash’ Basis</h3><p>As NAR points out in its guidance, homeowner’s insurance is not always required particularly when there is no lender or financing being obtained in connection with a purchase. When a buyer is purchasing a property on an “all cash” basis, there is no legal requirement that homeowner’s insurance coverage be put in place prior to a closing. Therefore, it is imperative to inform buyers who are purchasing a property on an “all cash” basis to begin researching insurance coverage options as early as the acceptance of an offer by the seller. When there is no lender, it is up to the real estate agent and attorney to inform their clients about obtaining homeowner’s insurance on the premises.</p><h3 id="the-cost-of-homeowner%E2%80%99s-insurance-an-important-consideration-when-purchasing">The Cost of Homeowner’s Insurance:<br>An Important Consideration When Purchasing</h3><p>As NAR explains, “The cost of homeowners insurance depends on several factors, including your credit history (in some states), the house’s age, square footage, condition of the property, and location.” These various factors may make it difficult, and sometimes even impossible, for buyers to obtain insurance coverage, or at least coverage that is affordable. Many buyers and real estate practitioners focus on the usual expenses when purchasing a home, such as the interest rates, monthly mortgage payments and real estate taxes. In most instances, buyers fail to consider the cost of homeowner’s insurance, which can be several thousands of dollars annually and which can increase the monthly payments significantly.</p><p>It is also important for real estate attorneys to take these factors into account and consider including provisions in the contract of sale allowing a purchaser to cancel the contract if the purchaser is unable to obtain insurance coverage due to reasons beyond the purchaser’s control. Events like the wildfires in California, and other severe weather events such as hurricanes and storms like the ones that hit Rockland and Westchester counties in 2023 and New York City in 2021, have inevitably led to an increase in rates and difficulty in obtaining coverage on homes located in these areas. It is important for attorneys to include protections and contingencies in the contract in the event a buyer is unable to obtain coverage for any reason.</p><h3 id="consideration-of-lender-requirements-when-obtaining-insurance">Consideration of Lender Requirements When Obtaining Insurance</h3><p>When a lender is involved in providing financing for a real estate transaction, it is recommended that buyers check with their lenders to make certain that they do not have any unexpected or overly burdensome requirements. It is common for lenders to require that certain coverages be obtained. Lenders may also restrict the homeowner’s ability to choose a higher deductible in an attempt to reduce the annual premium. As previously mentioned, properties may also be located in areas where insurance companies have deemed to be high-risk locations and may have certain restrictions and/or added costs for those areas, or may simply not provide coverage at all in those areas.</p><h3 id="use-of-aerial-images-to-drop-coverage">Use of Aerial Images to Drop Coverage</h3><p>Another new phenomenon a homebuyer should be aware of is the use of aerial and satellite imaging by insurance companies to drop coverage or not allow a homeowner to renew a policy. The New York Post article [see <a href="https://bit.ly/40uXzLo">https://bit.ly/40uXzLo</a>] highlights the risks surrounding these practices utilized by insurance companies. As reported by the New York Post, “The Geospatial Insurance Consortium, an industry-funded group that carries out aerial surveillance missions, said it has photographed 99% of homes in the US.” The article points out that insurance companies are now using these photos to determine the condition of a roof, or to pinpoint risks that exist on the property such as trampolines, pools, tree branches and even moss, and as a result sends out non-renewal or cancelation notices to a homeowner.</p><p>It is important for purchasers to be aware of these practices and the possibility that after a closing, their insurance company may send out an unexpected cancellation or non-renewal notice if any of the conditions above are found to exist. For example, while most purchasers have a property inspected prior to entering into contract, many may choose to accept the property “as is” with respect to the condition of the roof (which may require replacement but not immediately), the existence of a trampoline, or other issue. However, after the closing an insurance company could utilize these aerial photos and require the homeowner to repair and/or replace the roof at a substantial expense (which the buyer did not expect and was not financially able to undertake right away) by a date certain or risk the cancellation of coverage.</p><h3 id="nar%E2%80%99s-guidance-important-to-understand-what%E2%80%99s-covered">NAR’s Guidance: Important to Understand What’s Covered</h3><p>NAR’s Guidance also provides important information on the different types of coverages that are available to homebuyers. According to NAR, there are two types of coverages: (1) “Named Peril” and (2) “Open Peril.” “Named Peril” coverage “pays only if the damage is caused by a specifically named peril. The most popular policy, HO-3, covers the home structure and personal belongings for disasters including fire, hail, lightning, freezing, theft, and vandalism.” “Open Peril” coverage “pays in all instances except for when the damage is caused by an incident that is specifically excluded. HO-5 insurance policies may offer more extensive, open-peril coverage, but they often have higher premiums and more eligibility requirements.”</p><h3 id="important-differences-in-claim-reimbursements">Important Differences in Claim Reimbursements</h3><p>As NAR explains there are four different reimbursements that are available: (1) Actual Cash Value; (2) Replacement Cost Value; (3) Guaranteed Replacement Cost; or (4) Extended Replacement Cost. For policies that pay out claims based on “Actual Value” an “insurer pays out the cost to fix the home and replace your personal belongings, minus any depreciation. For example, if you bought a new table five years ago for $1,500, but due to normal wear and tear, it’s only worth $750 at the time of the covered incident, then your insurer will only pay out up to $750.” This coverage will likely cost less but may reimburse a homeowner significantly less than expected in the event of a casualty loss.</p><p>A second type of policy will reimburse a homeowner for a covered claim based on a “Replacement Cost Value” basis. This coverage “will reimburse the money needed to make repairs and/or purchase a comparable new model at today’s prices without taking depreciation into account.” As NAR points out, “In this case, even if you only paid $1,500 for the table five years ago, if a comparable model is $2,500 today, then you may be paid $2,500 to replace the damaged furniture.” This coverage is clearly more favorable and provides a homeowner with the money needed to repair the home and replace personal property at present-day value without a reduction in the reimbursement amount as a result of depreciation.</p><p>According to NAR, the best (and more expensive) available coverages are known as “Guaranteed Replacement Cost” and “Extended Replacement Cost” policies. A “guaranteed replacement policy” will reimburse the homeowner the actual cost of replacement regardless of any policy limit. An “extended replacement policy” will pay up to a certain set percentage above the policy limit contained in a policy. NAR provided examples and explained that “a home insured for $500,000 that takes $750,000 to rebuild would be completely covered with a guaranteed replacement policy. But an extended coverage policy at 20% would mean the insurer pays 120% ($600,000), or $100,000 above the limit.”</p><h3 id="knowledge-of-insurance-issues-is-critical">Knowledge of Insurance Issues is Critical</h3><p>All real estate professionals, homeowners, and purchasers should be aware of the issues and potential pitfalls surrounding homeowner’s insurance. Knowledge of the coverage options available, the costs and the risks of non-renewal and cancellation will only serve to assist and protect homebuyers when making decisions to purchase a home in a particular area, or purchasing a home that may have certain risks associated with it. Researching the availability of the appropriate coverages and costs in advance will make the buying process smoother and less risky. Arming a buyer-client with this important information in advance will only add value to the services a real estate professional provides and will set that individual apart from the others.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the coming prime spring selling season on the horizon and recent inflation data pointing to a pause in rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the short term and less rate cuts than anticipated in 2025, <em>Real Estate In-Depth </em>recently polled a group of veteran Realtors and Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors officials for their sense of the local markets going forward.</p><p>A key theme in their assessments was that activity will be driven in large part by available inventory and whether buyers will come to the realization and be comfortable with the fact that lending rates of 4% and lower are in the rear-view mirror and that rates are likely going to fluctuate between 6% and 7% this year. In fact, earlier this week National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun predicted that rates could fall slightly to 6.5% by the time the spring selling season begins.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/01/The-Pulse-of-the-market1--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1415" height="1080" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/The-Pulse-of-the-market1--1-.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/The-Pulse-of-the-market1--1-.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/01/The-Pulse-of-the-market1--1-.png 1415w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="hgar-president-vlora-sejdi-associate-broker-homesmart-homes-and-estates-white-plains">HGAR President Vlora Sejdi<br>Associate Broker<br>HomeSmart Homes and Estates, White Plains</h3><p>“The Hudson Valley isn’t slowing down. Our housing market is shaped by three key drivers: demographic shifts, housing supply, and interest rates,” she said. “Demand will stay strong, with Millennials and Gen Z entering their peak home-buying years. But the inventory issue isn’t going away—Westchester had less than two months of supply during the peak spring market. We need six for a healthy, balanced market.”</p><p>She added that even with rate cuts by the Fed, “relief will be slow and measured, and affordability will still be the biggest hurdle for buyers, especially in areas where new construction lags.” She noted that home builders are trying to fill the inventory gap, but it will take time for availability to return to normal.</p><p>Despite the market headwinds, Sejdi, who is an agent for HomeSmart Homes and Estates in White Plains, predicts solid home sales activity in the New York metro area with sales 11% higher than 2024 and prices increasing by approximately 6%.</p><p>“This market is ever evolving, and staying ahead means embracing change. If we want real progress, we need smart solutions—zoning updates, better policies for new builds, and creative reuse of existing spaces. Smart policies will be critical to keeping this market moving forward—and keeping buyers in the game,” said Sejdi, who is being officially installed as the 2025 HGAR President at a gala event on Jan. 30 at the Villa Barone Hilltop Manor in Mahopac.</p><h3 id="joseph-rand-chief-creative-officer-howard-hanna-rand-realty-nanuet">Joseph Rand<br>Chief Creative Officer<br>Howard Hanna | Rand Realty, Nanuet</h3><p>“The key market driver for 2025 is inventory. The market has been starved for inventory for three years now, which has driven sales down to the lowest level since the Financial Crisis of 2008-09,” Rand, who also serves as the Mayor of Nyack, said. “But we’ve seen some positive signs in the past few months, and if that continues, we expect that 2025 sales will be much stronger than this past year. I expect sales will go up in 2025 from their current levels, only because I think we hit a bottom last year and won’t go any lower.”</p><p>Rand echoed the refrain from many real estate professionals that the Hudson Valley needs more housing, which would stabilize prices at current levels. “In particular, we need entry-level housing: condos, coops, and smaller, more modest, homes. We need starter homes for people in their 20s or 30s, or they’re not going to be able to afford to live here,” he said.</p><p>In terms of mortgage rates and their impact on the market, Rand related, “I think people have to accept that 4% interest rates are not coming back, and even 5% interest rates are unlikely to return anytime soon. Rates at 6% are the new normal, and from a historical perspective they’re completely fine, especially given the strength of the economy and inflation adjusted wage gains over the past few years.”</p><h3 id="hgar-chief-executive-officer-lynda-fernandez">HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez</h3><p>On a positive note, Fernandez, who has served as HGAR’s Chief Executive Officer since September 2023, said, “Momentum continues to build in the Hudson Valley real estate market and in markets throughout the country. Pending sales in Westchester, the Bronx, and Rockland counties increased in November, reflecting more buyers coming into the market,” she said. “Despite a healthy job market and buyers seemingly adjusting to the new normal of interest rates hovering between 6% and 7 %, insufficient supply continues to impact sales activity.”</p><p>She added, “In 2025, we expect to continue to see more demand than supply, resulting in historically low months of supply and fewer sales. Since demand continues to outpace supply, home values are expected to continue to rise significantly. HGAR will continue to advocate on behalf of homeowners and renters, supporting legislation and initiatives that increases supply and create more housing opportunities for all segments of our population.”</p><h3 id="anthony-domathoti-ahwd-crs-c2ex-ci-broker-owner-exit-realty-premium-bronx">Anthony Domathoti, AHWD, CRS, C2EX, CI<br>Broker-Owner<br>EXIT Realty Premium, Bronx</h3><p>Domathoti, who served as HGAR President in 2022, said the 2025 housing market will be heavily influenced by the interplay of housing inventory shortages, fluctuating interest rates, and evolving policies from the National Association of Realtors and recent developments involving the Department of Justice.</p><p>“Inventory levels remain a challenge in all three regions. According to HGAR and OneKey MLS data, Manhattan continues to experience limited new housing supply despite ongoing redevelopment projects like Hudson Yards Phase 2,” he said. “Inventory in the Bronx remains tight, particularly for multi-family properties, as demand outpaces new development. In the Hudson Valley, competition for single-family homes has resulted in a 15% decrease in active listings compared to 2024, driving up home prices.”</p><p>While interest rates are expected to stabilize in 2025 after recent volatility, affordability remains a concern. Mortgage rates hovering between 6% and 6.5% may deter some first-time buyers, particularly in the Bronx and Hudson Valley, he related.</p><p>In terms of how he feels the local residential markets will fare this year, Domathoti said, “The housing markets in Manhattan, the Bronx, and the Hudson Valley will be shaped by inventory shortages, mortgage rate trends, and regulatory developments in 2025. Manhattan’s luxury market will remain strong despite limited supply, while the Bronx’s affordability challenges and infrastructure investments will drive demand for multi-family homes.”</p><p>He added, “In the Hudson Valley, low inventory coupled with Fannie Mae’s forecast of mortgage rate stabilization around 6% will sustain strong competition for suburban homes. Additionally, NAR mandates and DOJ-driven reforms will enhance transparency, benefiting buyers and sellers while reshaping brokerage practices in these regions.”</p><h3 id="tony-l-danzica-jd-cips-ahwd-broker-owner-dynamax-realty-nyc-inc-manhattan">Tony L. D'Anzica, JD, CIPS, AHWD<br>Broker-Owner<br>DynaMax Realty NYC, Inc., Manhattan</h3><p>D’Anzica, who served as the 2023 HGAR President, also stressed that the lack of inventory will be the key driver for the regional housing market this year.</p><p>“Supply driven market forces will continue to dictate the real estate market's behavior in our region. A lack of housing inventory will ensure that home prices will continue to appreciate, exacerbating the affordability crisis. Sellers will also remain hesitant to sell and then buy a new home with a higher mortgage rate,” he said.</p><p>D'Anzica also doesn’t expect any action taken by the Federal Reserve to have any immediate impact on market conditions in the region. “While the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates modestly, mortgage rates have not substantially followed suit. Even if mortgage rates do respond positively to the Fed's actions, they would do so slowly and over time,” he said. “Renewed optimism in a more favorable business environment because of a more business-friendly administration in Washington will likely have more impact on the housing market in 2025 than Federal Reserve action.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales climbed in December, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales advanced in three major U.S. regions and slipped in the Midwest. Year-over-year, sales accelerated in all four regions, NAR stated in its report released earlier today (Jan. 24)</p><p>Northeast home sales grew nearly 4% in December as compared to a month earlier and the median sale price grew by almost 12% in the region year-over-year.</p><p>On an annual basis, existing-home sales (4.06 million) declined to the lowest level since 1995, while the median price reached a record high of $407,500 in 2024.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—elevated 2.2% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.24 million in December. Year-over-year, sales swelled 9.3% (up from 3.88 million in December 2023).</p><p>“Home sales in the final months of the year showed solid recovery despite elevated mortgage rates,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Home sales during the winter are typically softer than the spring and summer, but momentum is rising with sales climbing year-over-year for three straight months. Consumers clearly understand the long-term benefits of homeownership. Job and wage gains, along with increased inventory, are positively impacting the market.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of December was 1.15 million units, down 13.5% from November, but up 16.2% from one year ago (990,000). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.3-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 3.8 months in November but up from 3.1 months in December 2023.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $404,400, up 6.0% from one year ago ($381,400). All four U.S. regions posted price increases.</p><p>“The median home price was elevated partly due to the upper-end market’s relative better performance,” Yun added. “Sales rose by 35% from a year ago for homes priced above $1 million, while sales fell for homes priced under $250,000.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 35 days in December, up from 32 days in November and 29 days in December 2023.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 31% of sales in December, up from 30% in November 2024 and 29% in December 2023. NAR’s 2024 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released November 2024—found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%, the lowest ever recorded.</p><p>Cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in December, up from 25% in November but down from 29% in December 2023.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 16% of homes in December, up from 13% in November and identical to December 2023.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in December, unchanged from November and the previous year.</p><h3 id="mortgage-rates">Mortgage Rates</h3><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.96% as of January 23.

    <description><![CDATA[Contract activity fell more sharply in the high-priced regions of the Northeast and West, where elevated mortgage rates have appreciably cut affordability.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON —Pending home sales retracted 5.5% in December—following four consecutive months of increases—the National Association of Realtors reported today (Jan. 30). All four U.S. regions experienced month-over-month losses in transactions, with the most significant fall in the West. Year-over-year, contract signings fell in all four U.S. regions, with the Midwest seeing the largest decrease.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index slid 5.5% to 74.2 in December. Year-over-year, pending transactions declined 5.0%. Last year’s cyclical low point occurred in July 2024 at 70.2. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“After four straight months of gains in contract signings, one step back is not welcome news, but it is not entirely surprising,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Economic data never moves in a straight line. High mortgage rates have not significantly dented housing demand due to greater numbers of cash transactions.”</p><p>“Contract activity fell more sharply in the high-priced regions of the Northeast and West, where elevated mortgage rates have appreciably cut affordability,” Yun added. “Job gains tend to have greater impact in more affordable regions.

    <description><![CDATA[Sullivan County’s December sales of single-family homes increased by 49.1%—the highest in the six-county region.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—For the first time in several months, December single-family home sales experienced double-digit growth in all areas of the lower Hudson Valley, including the Bronx. Sullivan County reported the highest sales gains at almost 50%.</p><p>Single-family median sales prices also increased in all regions, with the Bronx leading with a 10.1% uptick, from $631,000 in December 2023 to $695,000 in December 2024. Westchester County still held the lead for the highest median sales price at $911,500—up 6% from last year at $860,000.</p><p>Rockland County saw the highest growth in condo sales at 67.6%, but Orange County’s median condo prices topped the other regions with a 25.5% increase from $255,000 last December to $319,000 in December 2024.</p><p>Sales in the co-op market were down in most areas, with the exception of the Bronx, which experienced a 21.9% hike over last year. Median sales prices for co-ops were mixed, but Westchester’s prices grew 13.1% to $225,000, as compared to $199,000 last December.</p><p>Single-family home inventory declined in all areas except Sullivan County, which saw a 22.6% growth. Condo inventory soared by 73% in Orange County, and 53.2% in Rockland. Orange and Rockland also dominated the inventory increases in the co-op market, with Rockland leading at a 112.5% growth rate, from eight to 17 co-ops on the market in December. While there are few co-op sales in Orange, the inventory rose by 40% from five to seven co-ops.</p><p>New listings for all property types varied throughout the region in December. The report released on Jan. 30 by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors was based on data supplied by OneKey MLS.</p><blockquote>“New York City and the Hudson Valley remain two of the most desired destinations in the world, offering an exciting and culture-rich lifestyle and robust job market. We expect to see a more balanced real estate market in most of our service area in 2025,” said Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO. “While extremely low supply coupled with very high demand persists, increased inventory will allow more housing choices for potential homebuyers throughout the Bronx and New York City, and the lower Hudson Valley.”</blockquote><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>The Bronx co-op market took the lead on closed sales in December with a 21.9% gain over last year. Single-family home sales were close behind with a 21.2% increase, but condo sales dropped by 40.9% over December 2023. Median sales prices rose by 10.1% for single-family homes to $695,000, and condos by 1.6% to $289.000. Only co-op median prices declined by 10.1% to $240,000 from the December 2023 sales price of $267,000.</p><p>New listings for co-ops were up by 20.8% but declined for both condos and single-family homes at 33.3% and 19%, respectively. Inventory also decreased for all three property types, with condos seeing the largest drop at 38.8%, compared to single-family homes at 11.5% and co-ops at 1.6%. Months of supply declined by 11.1% to 5.6 months, and pending sales decreased by just 1.1%. A balanced market between buyers and sellers usually has between 6.0 months and 9.0 months of supply.</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>Closed sales of Westchester County condos grew by 29.1%, and single-family homes by 12.2% in December. Co-op sales increased by 2.1%. Median sales prices for all three property types rose, with co-ops experiencing the largest growth at 13.1% to $225,000. Single family home prices rose by 6% to $911,500, and condos by 0.9% to $482.500.</p><p>New listings for single-family homes grew by 15.2% but decreased for both condos and co-ops by 29.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Only the co-op market saw a slight increase in inventory by 2.5%. Inventory for single-family homes declined by 24.3% and 3.8% for condos. Months of supply for all property types was down 10.1% to 1.7 months, and pending sales were up by 8.6%.</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Putnam County’s single-family home sales grew by 15.5% in December, while the condo market saw a decrease in sales by 23.1%. There were no co-op sales reported last month. The median single-family home sales price rose by 9% to $566,900, and condo prices by 14% to $382,000.</p><p>New listings for single-family homes jumped by 33.3%, but condo listings declined by 28.6%. Inventory for both property types decreased in December by 13.3% for condos and 6.4% for single-family homes. There were no changes in months of supply for all property types, which stood at two months in December. Pending rose sales by 1.7%.</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Rockland’s condo sales saw the highest increase at 67.6%, followed by single-family homes sales a 15.1% hike. Co-op sales, however, decreased by12.5%. The condo median sales price had the highest increase at 16.5% to $419,250, while co-op prices rose 6.9% to $140,000. Single-family home prices gained a modest 2.6% to $718,000.</p><p>New listings for the condo market soared by 56.5% while dropping 28.3% for single-family homes and 25% for co-ops. The co-op market was the big winner for inventory in December, with a huge increase of 112.5%. However, Rockland’s co-op market remains small, with just 17 properties listed in December 2024, over eight listed last year. Condo inventory increased by 53.2%, while inventory of single-family homes declined by 20.7%. Months of supply for all property types dropped by 12.5% to 2.1 months, but pending sales rose by 16%.</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>In Orange County, sales of single-family homes grew by 19% in December. Condos saw a mild 3.2% uptick in sales, but co-op sales declined by 33.3%. Median sales prices for condos rose by 25.5% to $319,000, and 8.9% for single-family homes to $473,000. The co-op market prices declined by 14.5% to $141,000.</p><p>Condos led the way in new listings with a 42.9% rise, while new listings for single-family homes decreased by 7.5%. New co-op listings remained unchanged from last December, with just two currently listed on the market. However, inventory for co-ops rose by 40% from 5 to 7 co-ops. Condos saw a huge increase in inventory at 73%, while single-family home inventory modestly declined at just 0.4%. Months of supply for all property types was up 6.0% to 3.1 months, and pending sales grew by 3.9%.</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>Sullivan County’s December sales of single-family homes increased by 49.1%—the highest in the six-county region. There were no condo sales reported, and just one co-op sale. While Sullivan’s co-op market is very small, that one sale did represent a huge hike of 188.9% in the median sales price of $130,000, as compared to the December 2023 co-op median sales price of $45,000.</p><p>New listings for single-family homes dropped by 18.2% but inventory grew by 22.6%. New listings for both condos and co-ops were flat in December. Months of supply advanced by 20.8% to 6.4 months. Pending sales increased by 8.8%.</p><p><em>(NOTE : Link to ALL regional reports:&nbsp; </em><a href="https://www.hgar.com/news-stats/market-stats" rel="noreferrer"><em>Market Data (hgar.com)</em></a><em> Scroll down to 2024 Market Stats)</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—The 2024 real estate market across the New York metropolitan area, experienced rising home prices, continued inventory constraints, and a slight decline in closed sales, officials with OneKey MLS reported today.</p><p>The closed median sale price for the region reached $637,500, reflecting a 9.5% increase over 2023. Individual property types saw varying degrees of appreciation, with single-family homes up 9.4%, condominiums rising 6.3%, and co-ops increasing slightly by 0.7%.</p><p>Despite higher home prices, 48,857 closed sales transactions were recorded in 2024, representing a 2.5% decrease compared to the previous year. The highest number of closed sales occurred in Suffolk County with 12,913, followed by Nassau County with 9,748, and Westchester County with 7,127.</p><p>One of the most significant market challenges remained low inventory. The number of available homes for sale fell by 6.8% to 13,091, continuing a trend that has constrained buyer options. However, pending sales increased by 1.5% to 51,060, indicating a steady level of buyer demand heading into 2025.</p><p>OneKey MLS has the most accurate listings in metropolitan New York, straight from the largest Realtor-run MLS in the Empire State with more than 45,000 Realtors across Long Island, Manhattan, and the Hudson Valley.</p><p>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, said of the market conditions last year: “The 2024 housing market was defined by rising prices and tight inventory, which continued to challenge affordability and limit choices for buyers. While total closed sales declined slightly, strong buyer demand kept home prices moving upward across all property types.”</p><p>He continued, “With pending sales showing a slight uptick and economists predicting a more active housing market in 2025, we expect to see a more balanced environment as conditions gradually improve for buyers and sellers alike.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[In the past five years, from 2019 to 2024, the median home price rose by 49.9%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Almost 90% of metro markets (201 out of 226, or 89%) experienced home price increases in the fourth quarter of 2024, as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.12% to 6.85%, according to the National Association of Realtors’ latest quarterly report. Fourteen percent of the 226 tracked metro areas posted double-digit price gains over the same period, up from 7% in the third quarter.</p><p>“Record-high home prices and the accompanying housing wealth gains are definitely good news for property owners,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, renters who are looking to transition into homeownership face significant hurdles.”</p><p>Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price elevated 4.8% to $410,100. In the previous quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 3.2%. In the past five years, from 2019 to 2024, the median home price rose by 49.9%.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South registered the largest share of single-family existing-home sales (45.1%) in the fourth quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 2.1%. Prices also increased 10.6% in the Northeast, 8.0% in the Midwest and 4.0% in the West.</p><p>The top 10 metro areas with the largest year-over-year median price increases, which can be influenced by the types of homes sold during the quarter, all experienced gains of at least 14.9%. Six of the markets were in the Midwest. Overall, those markets were Jackson, MS (28.7%); Peoria, IL (19.6%); Chattanooga, TN-GA (18.2%); Elmira, NY (17.6%); Fond du Lac, WI (17.6%); Cleveland-Elyria, OH (16.4%); Bismarck, ND(15.8%); Akron, OH (15.5%); Blacksburg-Christiansburg, VA (15.0%); and Canton-Massillon, OH (14.9%).</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/02/Infographic-NAR-Q4-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Infographic-NAR-Q4-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Infographic-NAR-Q4-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/02/Infographic-NAR-Q4-2024-Metro-Home-Prices-2.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Eight of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Overall, those markets were San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA. ($1,920,000; 9.7%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,360,000; 4.7%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,315,600; 5.2%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,103,100; 3.2%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($985,000; 5.7%); Salinas, CA ($943,900; -5.0%); Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CZ ($939,700; 6.3%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($927,200; 1.7%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($920,000; 0.3%); and Boulder, CO ($840,700; -1.0%).</p><p>Almost 11% of markets (24 of 226) experienced home price declines in the fourth quarter, down from 13% in the third quarter.</p><p>"While recognizing many workers may not have the option to relocate, those who can or are willing to move may find more affordable conditions, especially given the wide variance in home prices nationwide," Yun said.</p><p>Housing affordability marginally improved in the fourth quarter. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,124, down 0.8% from the third quarter ($2,141) and 1.7%—or $37—from one year ago. Families typically spent 24.8% of their income on mortgage payments, down from 25.2% in the previous quarter and 26.5% one year ago.</p><p>First-time buyers found slightly better affordability circumstances compared to the prior quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $348,600 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment declined to $2,083, down 0.9% from the previous quarter ($2,101). That was a decrease of $35, or 1.7%, from one year ago ($2,118).

    <description><![CDATA[NYPA will construct the first major commercial office building in Westchester County in nearly a half-century.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The New York Power Authority is making commercial real estate history in Downtown White Plains. NYPA recently spent a likely record $30 million to acquire a pad site at the Hamilton Green development property in Downtown White Plains that will eventually be home to its new more than 350,000-square-foot corporate headquarters building, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has learned.</p><p>In addition to the historically lofty land purchase price, NYPA will construct the first major commercial office building in Westchester County in nearly a half-century at the former White Plains Mall site. A spokesperson for the New York Power Authority confirmed reports sources gave to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that NYPA had purchased the pad site recently for $30 million from the ownership of Hamilton Green (LRC Construction of White Plains and RXR of New York City). The transaction closed during the first week of this month. The exact size of the pad site was not known at press time.</p><p>The NYPA spokesperson said that Hamilton Green and NYPA are still in negotiations for the design and construction of the new 360,000-square-foot corporate headquarters office building. The authority is currently headquartered at 123 Main St. in Downtown White Plains but has deemed that building out of date and too expensive to upgrade. NYPA, according to an RFP issued a year and a half ago and recent documents, is currently considering disposing of the more than 417,000-square-foot office building.</p><p>Developer Louis Cappelli, a principal of LRC Construction, had no comment on the NYPA transaction when contacted by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>. The ownership of the Hamilton Green development, which is currently under construction, did notify the City of White Plains of the changes to its development plans to accommodate the new NYPA headquarters building.</p><p>The new corporate headquarters transactions stem from an RFP issued by NYPA in August 2023 detailing the company’s search for a new corporate headquarters site limited strictly to the White Plains Central Business District.</p><p>Previously, NYPA had determined Hamilton Green as the preferred developer for the project and last October, at its Board of Trustees meeting approved a resolution to move forward on a binding agreement with Hamilton Green. If that project moves forward as expected, sources have indicated the development project for the new state-of-the-art headquarters would exceed $300 million.</p><p>At the NYPA Board of Trustees meeting on Jan. 28, the Board approved a security design services contract and a real estate consulting services contract in connection with the new headquarters project that detailed other expenditures and previewed some of its plans going forward.</p><p>The NYPA Board approved a security design services contract with The Clarient Group, LLC of Iselin, NJ. The Board had initially awarded a $20,000 contract on Dec. 18, 2024, and approved a three-year deal for $300,000 at its Jan. 28 meeting. In NYPA documents, it stated: “The Authority is engaged in the construction of a new White Plains Office Headquarters Building. The project scope includes the construction of a new 360,000 square feet commercial tower, turn-key by the Developer to relocate the Authority from their existing offices on 123 Main Street.”</p><p>The second contract award at the NYPA Board of Trustees’ session on Jan. 28 was with Chicago-based commercial real estate brokerage firm Jones Lang LaSalle Brokerage, Inc. According to NYPA documents, JLL was paid $300,000 for the completion of feasibility studies and scenario planning in November 2023. A month later the Board of Trustees approved $1 million in funding to JLL for its services pertaining to the release of the new corporate headquarters RFP. At its May 2024 meeting, the NYPA Board approved another $2.9 million to JLL to provide project planning, design development services, the preparation of final construction contract documents, as well as advisory services.</p><p>The NYPA Board approved a staff request for another $1.68 million to JLL on Jan. 28 for negotiation and advisory services associated with the contract executions for the acquisition of the new building site.</p><p>NYPA further stated that “further funding may be requested if it is determined that we proceed with the disposal of (the) 123 Main Street building.” The NYPA RFP also included the possible disposal of its 123 Main St. headquarters building. NYPAA has not made a final decision on that possible sale and did not provide any update when contacted by <em>Real Estate In-Depth.</em></p><p>At a meeting of the Building Owners and Managers Association last month, Bruce Berg, chief executive officer of Cappelli Development Company of White Plains, discussed the NYPA headquarters project. “It is our hope that we will be building a headquarters for them on Hamilton Green on the corner of MLK and Hamilton Avenue directly across the street from where they are today,” Berg said.</p><p>The transaction would have NYPA acquire the land and contract with a Cappelli affiliate (LRC Construction) to build the new headquarters. Cappelli would serve as the developer and general contractor for the project. He shared that NYPA plans to have the building feature geothermal, solar panels and electrochromic glass that will have the glass change color depending on the direction of sunlight to reduce glare and heat inside the building.</p><p>Berg said the building will be highly energy efficient and all electric, with the exception of gas for building generators.</p><p>While some work has been started at the pad site for the NYPA building, it is not known at press time when construction will commence and when the project is anticipated to be completed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[For real estate professionals, particularly real attorneys and real estate agents, it is important to be aware of potential adverse possession issues that could exist when marketing a property.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent decision, <em>Gelles v. Sauvage,</em> issued on Jan. 9, 2025 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4gI7CBv">https://bit.ly/4gI7CBv</a>], the Bronx County Supreme Court granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on a cause of action to quiet title and held that the plaintiff-acquired title by adverse possession to a portion of the defendant’s property, which was occupied by a stone garage that encroached upon the defendant’s property. For real estate professionals, particularly real attorneys and real estate agents, it is important to be aware of potential adverse possession issues that could exist when marketing a property and also when preparing a contract of sale in connection with a real estate transaction.</p><p><strong>The Facts in <em>Gelles v. Sauvage</em></strong></p><p>In 1997, the plaintiff purchased real property in the Bronx which abutted the property of the defendant. The garage was present since before the plaintiff purchased the property. It consisted of “three walls made of 18–inch–thick stone, a roof, a floor, and (at one point) doors.” In 2005–2006, the plaintiff also submitted evidence that “her husband poured new concrete in the garage, painted the exterior walls, and installed new roofing.”</p><p>In April 2015, the defendant hired workers to demolish that portion of the stone garage that was located on her property, which they did in fact demolish. The plaintiff soon commenced this action to quiet title to the area where the stone garage was located and claimed that “she had acquired the stone garage area by adverse possession during the 10 years following her acquisition of her property.”</p><h3 id="the-basic-elements-of-adverse-possession">The Basic Elements of Adverse Possession</h3><p>The Supreme Court points out that in order to establish adverse possession, a plaintiff must “must establish that the character of the possession is: (1) hostile and under a claim of right; (2) actual; (3) open and notorious; (4) exclusive; and (5) continuous for a period of at least 10 years.” The court further explains that “where a claim of right is not based on a written instrument, [the] former [Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law Section (“RPAPL”)] 522, which the parties agree applies, requires that the land must have been ‘usually cultivated or improved’ or ‘protected by a substantial enclosure.’” It is important to note that there were some significant changes in the adverse possession law in 2008, however, since the events leading to the adverse possession claim predated the 2008 changes, the previous requirements and case law governed in this action. In this action, the plaintiff was able to show not only that the property was “protected by a substantial enclosure” but that the plaintiff also “improved” the property.</p><h3 id="higher-standard-of-proof-%E2%80%98clear-and-convincing%E2%80%99-evidence">Higher Standard of Proof: ‘Clear and Convincing’ Evidence</h3><p>The court also points out that a plaintiff in an adverse possession action is “required to prove each element by clear and convincing evidence.” According to the Ninth Circuit, citing the United States Supreme Court in <em>Colorado v. New Mexico (1984)</em>, “When a party has the burden of proving any claim or defense by clear and convincing evidence, it means that the party must present evidence that leaves you with a firm belief or conviction that it is highly probable that the factual contentions of the claim or defense are true. This is a higher standard of proof than proof by a preponderance of the evidence, but it does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” [<u>See</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/3EMwpr6">https://bit.ly/3EMwpr6</a>]. Establishing a claim by “clear and convincing evidence” is not an easy burden to overcome in a lawsuit, and justifiably so, particularly where individuals stand to lose their ownership rights in real property.</p><h3 id="actual-open-and-notorious-possession">Actual, Open and Notorious Possession</h3><p>The court points out that the defendant did not challenge the actual, open and notorious elements of adverse possession. The evidence presented by the plaintiff clearly established that the plaintiff had actual possession of the property and did so in an “open and notorious” manner leaving little room for any challenge that these elements were not met. However, the defendant “contend[ed] that [the] plaintiff failed to establish entitlement to summary judgment…and did not establish the elements of continuous, hostile, and exclusive possession.”</p><h3 id="the-element-of-%E2%80%98continuous-possession%E2%80%99">The Element of ‘Continuous Possession’</h3><p>The court explained that “As to continuous possession for the requisite 10–year period…, plaintiff submitted evidence that she and her husband continuously used the garage for either rental purposes, the proceeds of which went exclusively to plaintiff, or personal parking and storage since they took ownership of the Gelles property in June 1997.” As previously indicated, the plaintiff and her husband also made significant improvements to the garage. The court pointed out that “Their affidavits are neither equivocal nor open to opposing presumptions.” Additionally, the court held that the defendant failed to produce any evidence establishing that the plaintiff’s possession of the garage, and particularly the portion of the garage located on the defendant’s property, was not continuous for the requisite 10-year period.</p><h3 id="the-element-of-%E2%80%98hostile-possession%E2%80%99">The Element of ‘Hostile Possession’</h3><p>The court also explains what constitutes the element of “hostile possession” and pointed out that “[a] party…is not required to show enmity or specific acts of hostility.” Instead, the court explains that the plaintiff need only to show she possesses the property and exhibits “usual acts of ownership.” There is then a “presumption of hostility,” which the defendant must rebut. In this case, the plaintiff testified that she never sought the permission of the defendant “to use or improve the stone garage area and had no agreement, oral or written, to use it.” The plaintiff presented proof that she used, improved and even rented out the garage since 1997. The plaintiff’s husband also testified and presented an affidavit that they refused the defendant’s request to allow her and her son to park their car in the garage.</p><h3 id="rebuttable-presumption-of-the-hostility-element">Rebuttable Presumption of the Hostility Element</h3><p>The court points out that the defendant argued, relying on existing caselaw (<u>see</u> <em>Estate of Becker v. Murtagh</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/4hKcnfi">https://bit.ly/4hKcnfi</a>], that “where there is a close and cooperative relationship between the record owner and the person claiming title through adverse possession, the presumption of hostility may not apply.” A “close and cooperative” relationship could “rebut” the presumption that the element of hostility exists. However, the plaintiff and her husband testified that they did not have a good relationship with the defendants. The defendants also confirmed this at a deposition, and the court held that the defendants failed to rebut the presumption of hostility.</p><h3 id="the-requirement-of-%E2%80%98exclusive-possession%E2%80%99">The Requirement of ‘Exclusive Possession’</h3><p>The court explained that “in order to demonstrate ‘exclusive’ possession, the party claiming adverse possession ‘must alone care for or improve the disputed property as if it were his/her own.’” The court further explained that the same evidence presented by the plaintiff to establish the elements of “continuous” and “hostile” use also provided the “clear and convincing” evidence to establish the “exclusive” use element.</p><p>The defendant, in an attempt to counter the “exclusive use” element, argued that the plaintiff no longer had exclusive use of that portion of the garage since they had demolished it. Unfortunately, the court points out that this exercise of control by the defendants occurred after 18 years, which is long after the requisite 10-year period and by then the plaintiffs had already acquired adverse possession rights. Ultimately, the court decided the case in favor of the plaintiff and not only awarded summary judgment, but awarded the plaintiff costs as well.</p><h3 id="be-aware-of-adverse-possession-and-other-potential-encroachments">Be Aware of Adverse Possession and Other Potential Encroachments</h3><p>As is evident in the <em>Gelles</em> case, adverse possession and other encroachment issues can end up being very costly. The defendant actually demolished the structure which the court ultimately decided belonged to the plaintiff. While not always the case, sometimes issues, such as the one that arose in the Gelles case, can be avoided early on if there is a survey available for review. While the plaintiff here ultimately succeeded in court, it came at great time and expense.</p><p>Potential issues such as a garage or other encroachments (e.g., fences, sheds, walls, etc.) may be discernible on a survey and could, at the very least, raise a red flag early on. It is important for real estate practitioners, especially those representing buyers, to ask the other side for a copy of an existing survey or a prior title report or title policy. Many times, a prior title report or title policy may contain survey exceptions highlighting potential title and adverse possession claims, and alert a buyer to potential issues before entering into contract and ultimately purchasing the property.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales retreated in January, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales slipped in three major U.S. regions and held steady in the Midwest. Year-over-year, sales rose in three regions and were unchanged in the South, according to the data released by NAR on Feb. 21.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—descended 4.9% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.08 million in January. Year-over-year, sales improved 2.0% (up from 4 million in January 2024).</p><p>“Mortgage rates have refused to budge for several months despite multiple rounds of short-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “When combined with elevated home prices, housing affordability remains a major challenge.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of January was 1.18 million units, up 3.5% from December and 16.8% from one year ago (1.01 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.5-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.2 months in December and 3.0 months in January 2024.</p><p>"More housing supply allows strongly qualified buyers to enter the market," Yun added. "But for many consumers, both increased inventory and lower mortgage rates are necessary for them to purchase a different home or become first-time homeowners."</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in January was $396,900, up 4.8% from one year ago ($378,600).

    <description><![CDATA[HGAR believes that the law could have significant consequences for both landlords and tenants.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors is partnering with the Building &amp; Realty Institute of Westchester &amp; Mid-Hudson Region to present a crucial informational session on “Good Cause Eviction,” exploring its potential impact on the real estate industry. The session will be held at HGAR’s White Plains headquarters on Friday, February 28 from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.</p><p>Tim Foley, CEO of the BRI, will clarify how municipalities can modify the bill, and explain any unintended consequences as well as advocacy efforts regarding Good Cause Eviction. The Good Cause Eviction Law generally prohibits landlords from evicting residential tenants or refusing to renew residential leases without a court order and a valid legal justification, unless an exemption applies.</p><p>Ann Heaney-Korchak, Board President of the Small Property Owners of New York, will also participate in the session, providing valuable insights and firsthand experiences from New York City property owners who have already navigated the implementation of Good Cause Eviction laws. She will offer guidance to HGAR members on how to effectively advocate on this issue and navigate the practical implications should the law be enacted.</p><p>While the law aims to provide greater security and fairness to tenants by preventing evictions without good cause, some landlords argue that it imposes excessive restrictions. HGAR believes that the law could have significant consequences for both landlords and tenants, potentially making it more challenging for renters to secure quality, affordable housing while also impacting property owners' rights.</p><p>“In addition, the law could discourage property owners from investing in essential upgrades, and could eliminate ‘mom and pop’ landlords,” said Alex Roithmayr, HGAR Government Affairs Director. “As a result, this could create an opening for larger corporate landlords to take over the market.”</p><p>HGAR also argues that the law could restrict property rights, potentially reducing the availability of affordable rental housing if property owners choose to sell rather than navigate the new regulations. Additionally, it may lead to de facto perpetual residential leases, limiting a property owner’s ability to decide whether to renew a lease upon expiration. Ultimately, these decisions could be left to the courts to determine, resulting in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings for both tenants and landlords.</p><p>This session is open for HGAR members and non-members and will offer valuable insights from property managers and owners in NYC who are already dealing with the effects of Good Cause Eviction laws that have been passed. “This is a critical opportunity for HGAR members to unite and advocate against the proposed bill before the upcoming City of Middletown public hearing on this issue on March 4,” added Roithmayr.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales pulled back 4.6% in January according to the National Association of Realtors. The Midwest, South and West experienced month-over-month losses in transactions—with the most significant drop in the South—while the Northeast saw a modest gain. Year-over-year, contract signings lowered in all four U.S. regions, with the South seeing the greatest falloff.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—fell 4.6% to 70.6 in January, an all-time low. (Last year's cyclical low point in July 2024 was revised from 70.2 to 71.2.) Year-over-year, pending transactions declined 5.2%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><p>“It is unclear if the coldest January in 25 years contributed to fewer buyers in the market, and if so, expect greater sales activity in upcoming months,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, it's evident that elevated home prices and higher mortgage rates strained affordability.”</p><p>Housing affordability suffered in January as mortgage rates ranged from 6.91% to 7.04%. Compared to one year ago, the monthly mortgage payment on a $300,000 home increased by an extra $50 to $1,590.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/02/2025-01-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-02-27-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/2025-01-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-02-27-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/02/2025-01-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-02-27-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI rose 0.3% from last month to 63.4, down 0.5% from January 2024.

The West index fell by 1.2% from the prior month to 57.6, down 4.5% from January 2024.</p><p>“Even a slight reduction in mortgage rates will likely ignite buyer interest, given rising incomes, increased jobs and more inventory choices,” added Yun.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors held a highly informative in-person and virtual session on Feb. 25 that focused on the significant value Realtors can tap into by engaging in global real estate transactions.</p><p>The session held at HGAR’s offices in White Plains was entitled “Why Global? Understanding the Value of HGAR’s Global Business Council,” and was led by Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez and also featured Christina Prostano, HGAR Global Business Chair, and Holly Gluck, HGAR Global Business Vice Chair.</p><p>Fernandez, who earlier in her career spent more than 16 years at the Miami Association of Realtors, detailed the significant market share global real estate has in the Greater Miami area and noted that the Hudson Valley/New York City market area is also a major market for global transactions.</p><p>“The Hudson Valley is a region that marries timeless charm with dynamic global real estate appeal,” Fernandez said. “Not only does the Hudson Valley attract international homeowners and investors, but is home to international homeowners and investors.” She added that each county in the Hudson Valley has its own distinctive character “that presents a mosaic of opportunities for those looking to invest in real estate.”</p><p>Prostano, an Associate Broker and Founding Principal Global Collective Team at Compass in Manhattan, and Gluck, a real estate salesperson with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices New York Properties, shared their experiences in expanding their geographic reach to markets outside the United States.</p><p>The panel discussed the various international organizations that provide resources to Realtors interested in engaging in global real estate. Prostano related that many Realtors are already doing some international business and can increase their market share if they access the collective resources available for both inbound and outbound international transactions.</p><p>HGAR’s Global Networking Partner organizations include: the National Association of Realtors; the Asian Real Estate Association of America (AREAA); FIABCI, the International Real Estate Federation; the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP); the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) and the LGBTQ Real Estate Alliance.</p><p>Gluck noted that while New York City is a global destination and major market for international investors, the Hudson Valley is also an attractive market for global real estate deals.</p><p>She related that Realtors who take advantage of HGAR’s global offerings and affiliations “can be exposed to opportunities where you can network and grow whatever your interest might be.” Gluck later added, “We are all here to collaborate, share our ideas and see how we can help you expand or grow your business in the international arena.”</p><p>Some of the key takeaways from the program included:</p><p>According to the most recent data: the top sources for foreign direct investment in New York were: United Kingdom, 28%; France, 8%; Canada, 8%; Germany, 7%, Israel, 5% and Other, 43%.</p><ul>
<li>Approximately 3.2 million New York residents were born outside of the United States, which has resulted in ethnic enclaves statewide that offer residential and commercial business opportunities for Realtors.</li>
<li>New York State is actively creating innovative workforce development programs geared at attracting global commercial investors to generate new opportunities for business and regional economic growth.</li>
<li>New York is a global business and technology hub.</li>
<li>One out of 10 private jobs in the city are with a foreign-based company.</li>
<li>The New York metro region has a high percentage of foreign students that attend such prestigious universities as NYU, SUNY, CUNY, Long Island University, Columbia University, Manhattanville College, Brooklyn College, Iona University, Fordham University, Pace University, FIT, MCNY, IE NY College, Mercy University and others.</li>
<li>To reach foreign buyers, HGAR’s Global Business Council advises Realtors: to attend global events locally and abroad; connect with foreign delegates at NAR’s NXT The Realtor Experience Real Estate Conference and HGAR’s Global Summit; join bilateral Chambers of Commerce and multicultural organizations and attend foreign trade events.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HGAR Global Council will be holding Global Chats in the near future and is also planning its annual Global Summit to be held in November. HGAR will host the 19th Annual Global Real Estate Summit in New York City in collaboration with more than 10 real estate associations, along with NYSAR and NAR. The program attracts top real estate leaders and global practitioners who explore emerging trends and new opportunities in the international market. Further details will be released shortly on both the Global Chat and Global Summit program offerings.</p><p>Another upcoming local offering is The Long Island Board of Realtors Annual Global Breakfast on March 13 at 8:30 a.m. at the Hamlet /Golf &amp; Country Club in Commack.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With spring just around the corner, homeowners eager to prepare their property for the market, or just give it a fresh look, are seeking the latest interior design and staging trends to make their house stand out from the rest. And this year, deeper, richer colors, larger accessories and artwork, bonus spaces for multi-purpose usage, and connecting the inside with the outside could make a big difference in your home’s appearance.</p><p>Earlier this year, Pantone, a world-renowned company that provides color standards for design, printing, fashion and other industries, revealed its 2025 Color of the Year as Mocha Mousse, a rich, earthy brown. Benjamin Moore Paints’ Color of the Year remains in the same family with Cinnamon Slate, a warm chocolate grey tone, while Sherwin Williams introduced Grounded, another vibrant earth tone.</p><p>With rich browns dominating the color scheme this year, Pantone’s choice was based on evoking a feeling of the comfort of home and home décor including wood, stone, rattan, wicker, leather and linen. “Mocha Mousse expresses a level of thoughtful indulgence,” said Leatrice Eiseman, Executive Director, Pantone Color Institute. “Sophisticated and lush, yet at the same time an unpretentious classic, Mocha Mousse is infused with subtle elegance and earthy refinement.”</p><p>While continuing the trend of deeper shades, Glidden Paints chose Purple Basil as its 2025 Color of the Year, cleverly mixing hues of purple and dark green. Both Valspar and Dutch Boy decided on blues for this year with the deep Encore shade and a somewhat lighter Mapped Blue.</p><p>Susan Atwell, owner of AtWell Staged Home in Somers, is happy to see color making a comeback. “Grey has been out there for so long and I think most designers and stagers are tired of it,” she said. “These colors are cozier and create a comfortable mood that makes people feel right at home.”</p><p>Atwell noted she’s not abandoning neutral colors and does rely on off-whites with maybe a tint of grey for her staging clients. “Keeping the look clean and free of clutter, with a modern twist and a hint of warmth will make any home show very well,” she said. Atwell often adds furnishings and artwork that her clients already own to mix in with the rooms for optimal showings.</p><p>While staging a home in Ridgefield, CT, Atwell re-converted a dining room that had been serving as the family’s gym. They repainted using a bright, neutral shade, removed all of the gym equipment, relocated the table and light fixture from the kitchen, and even staged the bookcase using items from around the home, including a vintage model red car.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/dining1_before.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/dining1_before.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/dining1_before.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/dining1_before.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Before and after pictures of a Ridgefield, CT home gym to dining room conversion.

It’s all about the possibilities of how spaces can be used.”</p><p>Marie Graham, owner of The Refreshed Home in White Plains, agrees that color and specialty spaces in the home are the interior design trends for attracting buyers for Spring 2025. “We all know what to expect from a living and dining room, but if you can showcase unexpected spaces, people will remember that,” she said. Graham’s ideas include a meditation room, crafts space, mini yoga studio, or dedicated workspace.</p><p>She recently created a children’s reading area for one of her clients, using part of a larger room. “I got a pair of lime green, child-sized beanbag chairs and a basket full of books and all of sudden, you had a new, separate space,” she shared.</p><p>While she does believe in keeping rooms streamlined and free from clutter, Graham said it’s also best to “choose things important to the heart for the home.” For kitchens, she recommends classic designs with neutral tones, and warmer, denser colors for the living and family rooms. “You always want to create a soothing atmosphere,” she added.</p><p>Another trick that works well for both staging and interior design is bringing the outdoors inside. “Some people have created greenhouse windows in their kitchens, or you could simply open up French doors to bring in more light and connect to the outdoors,” Graham noted.</p><p>She also likes to use bright colors for accent pieces like pillows, books, or even a bowl of fruit on a coffee table. For sofas, she prefers solid colors rather than prints and suggests stretch slipcovers as an easy, quick fix.</p><p>One re-emerging design trend for 2025 is wallpaper. “It used to be very expensive, and you’d have to live with it for a long time,” said Graham. “But with these new ‘peel and stick’ versions, it can be much more affordable and not permanent. It’s a perfect choice for a power room or other small area.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[For the first time since 2016, new construction activity outpaced household formations. Yet, the nation still faces a supply shortfall of 3.8 million homes.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—More than a decade of underbuilding has left the U.S. with a shortage of nearly 4 million homes, according to a new analysis from Realtor.com released on May 10. With home prices and rents stretching budgets to their limits, this persistent supply gap is pushing homeownership increasingly out of reach for millions of Americans.</p><p>While recent construction gains show progress, they highlight the urgent need for bold policy action. Realtor.com's recent analysis found that in 2024, home completions grew to 1.6 million, the highest level in nearly two decades, driven by an increase in both single- and multi-family construction. For the first time since 2016, new construction activity outpaced household formations. Yet, the nation still faces a supply shortfall of 3.8 million homes—the third-largest annual gap since 2012, trailing only 2020 and 2023. At the 2024 pace, closing the gap would take 7.5 years, with the South catching up in three years, the West in 6.5 years, the Midwest in a staggering 41 years, and the Northeast making little to no progress.</p><p>The report stated: “Although the supply gap improved in 2024, it is still the third-largest annual gap since 2012, behind 2020 and 2023. The improvement compared with 2023 (4.3-million home gap) was due to a combination of lower household formations, lower pent-up demand, and higher new-construction activity, especially in the single-family segment. The largest single-year gap in the period of the analysis was in 2020 (an approximately 4.5-million home gap), though it was more of a blip than a trend due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p><p>Despite more homes being started last year, rising housing costs compounding on top of a lack of availability has kept many young adults from forming new households. Instead, many Millennials and Gen Zers opted to live with family or roommates, leading to an estimated 1.63 million “pent-up” households that didn't materialize in 2024. These households are an important part of understanding the challenge, and contribute to the almost 4 million total housing supply gap, highlighting the unmet demand for homes.</p><p>“While builders made strides last year, the scale of the historic housing shortage, paired with strong pent-up demand, meant that new supply couldn't fully close the nearly 4 million-home gap,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist, Realtor.com. “Young households are particularly feeling the strain, as buying a home on an early- to mid-career salary is increasingly out of reach for many. Though a rise in both multi- and single-family construction offered some relief amid low existing inventory, addressing the gap will take sustained effort and smart policy.”</p><h3 id="new-construction-overtakes-household-formations-costs-sideline-young-households">New Construction Overtakes Household Formations;<br>Costs Sideline Young Households</h3><p>For the first time since 2016, Realtor.com's report found new home construction outpaced household formations in 2024. Fewer than 1 million new households were formed in 2024—the slowest annual pace since 2016. Meanwhile, 1.36 million homes were started, exceeding household formations by nearly 400,000. Despite overtaking household formations, total housing starts were at their lowest level since 2020, largely from a slowdown in multi-family construction, while single-family housing starts surged to their second-highest level since 2007, as builders ramped up production to address the shortage of existing homes on the market.</p><h3 id="multi-family-construction-slows-amid-rising-rental-supply">Multi-Family Construction Slows Amid Rising Rental Supply</h3><p>While overall home completions grew last year, multi-family housing starts fell to their lowest level since 2017. After several years of strong multi-family activity, builders pulled back, particularly in high-density developments, responding to an oversupply in the rental market post-pandemic. This is likely foreshadowing a lower pace of new multi-family rental supply that will be completed in the near future. Still, the increase in both single- and multi-family completions helped drive overall inventory gains.</p><h3 id="regional-shifts-south-leads-the-way">Regional Shifts: South Leads the Way</h3><p>Housing supply trends varied widely by region. The South saw the most significant improvements in their housing gap in 2024, shrinking by 24.9%; however, it still has the largest gap by volume, with 1.15 million units needed. In the West, decent levels of new construction combined with only modest household formation contributed to the region's progress in narrowing its housing gap by 13.4%. The Midwest saw only modest progress, with a 2.4% reduction in its gap. In contrast, the Northeast was the only region where the housing supply gap widened, growing by 1.2% over the year, with 1.04 million units needed.</p><p>To tackle one of the biggest barriers to affordability, Realtor.com is launching “Let America Build,” a national campaign advocating for solutions that expand housing supply. Realtor.com's national Let America Build campaign is advocating for solutions that cut through red tape, restrictive zoning, and outdated regulations that are constricting the ability to build the homes America needs. The initiative calls on lawmakers at every level to make bold, pro-building choices. Realtor.com aims to join forces with some of the biggest industry leaders, including builders, policymakers and housing advocates to push for actionable change that will help create more homes—faster.</p><p>“America's housing shortage is holding back economic growth, driving up costs, and making it harder for millions of families to find a home,” said Damian Eales, CEO of Realtor.com. “Through Let America Build, we're rallying the right voices to push for real solutions that will unlock supply and make homeownership more attainable. That's a win for families, communities, and the entire economy—because when housing works, everything works.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Apicella noted that the Trump administration seems intent on eliminating or severely cutting back on federal green energy funding, which he said is critical to many new development projects.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—While the session was focused on highlighting transformational mixed-use projects in Westchester County, the major news from the program came from several developers and business executives who say that new anti-green funding policies and increased costs due to tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration could cause significant adverse impacts on development projects under construction and others on the drawing boards.</p><p>The conference presented by the Business Council of Westchester entitled: “Focus on Westchester’s Most Transformational Projects” featured: Joseph Apicella, executive vice president of MacQuesten Development LLC of Pelham; Adam Bosch, president of Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress of Newburgh; Bill Balter, president of WBP Development LLC of Chappaqua; Joan McDonald, director of operations, Westchester County; Richard Nightingale, president and CEO of Westhab of Yonkers and Stuart Rabin, village manager of the Village of Port Chester. The moderator of the program was Marsha Gordon, president and CEO of the Business Council of Westchester.</p><p>For the majority of the program, held on March 10 in White Plains, the panelists discussed how developers and investors are attracted to municipalities that welcome new development, particularly mixed-use projects that include some affordable units to address the shortage of workforce housing. In addition, larger developments tend to be located near Metro-North train stations in Westchester County. They also noted that without subsidies or incentives from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, New York State, municipalities and the federal government, many of their projects could not move forward.</p><p>However, when broaching potential headwinds to the new development sector, several panelists did not hold back on potential negative impacts from policies and tariffs either proposed or implemented by the Trump administration.</p><p>Apicella noted that the Trump administration seems intent on eliminating or severely cutting back on federal green energy funding, which he said is critical to many new development projects, particularly those that are focused on including sustainability-related amenities.</p><p>If those green funds are not available or clawed back by the Trump administration, “Some of the projects that we already have in the pipeline that are going to begin construction or are already under construction may become economically challenged as a result of this,” Apicella said.</p><p>He added that the business community needs to understand, “This is not about politics. This is about endangering the ability of us (developers) to move forward and build quality affordable housing,” he said.</p><p>Pattern for Progress’ Bosch interjected that he recently had conversations with four developers in the Hudson Valley who are very concerned over President Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canadian lumber, which is used extensively in the homebuilding industry, including by most home builders in the Hudson Valley.</p><p>The developers told Bosch, “If they started building it already, they are going to forge ahead. But for the projects that they have not sort of started to put into the ground, they are sticking them in neutral. They are going back and sitting on the bench.”</p><p>He added that one developer noted that a project that 30 days ago was estimated to cost $15 million, has recently shot up another $1.3 million in cost due to higher lumber costs related to the uncertainty about tariffs on Canadian goods. The developer told Bosch: “I can’t find enough nickels in my couch cushions to cover that $1.3 million.”</p><p>Westchester County’s McDonald noted that if developers have projects in the pipeline with federal funding in place, the county’s Planning Department will assist them in completing paperwork to help them qualify for federal funds so they can move their projects forward expeditiously.</p><p>She added, “Let’s not leave any money on the table that we know of right now. The future is unpredictable. We don’t know what is going to happen, but if you know you have money, we will help you get it.”</p><h3 id="major-takeaways-from-the-panel">Major Takeaways from the Panel:</h3><ul>
<li>WBP Development’s Balter, whose firm recently completed the adaptive reuse of the former YMCA property in Tarrytown, said the regulatory process has become harder over the past few years, but communities that are proactive in providing affordable housing are “changing the game.”</li>
<li>He noted that his firm has seen interest rates more than double over the past five years and construction costs rise approximately 30% since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. “We really want to go to communities that want us and there is now enough of an understanding of affordable housing and the asset that it is for communities that there are a lot of communities that are pulling us into their world and saying, ‘This is what we want, here is how we are going to help you,’” Balter said.</li>
<li>Westhab’s Nightingale said that the county currently has a “housing supply crisis and an unbelievably acute affordable housing supply crisis.” Westhab, which is a not-for-profit affordable housing developer, requires a host of funding sources to build quality developments for families that earn well below the county’s median income. Nightingale said that more than 40% of Westchester households (renters and home owners) are housing cost burdened (paying approximately 30% or more of their monthly income on housing).</li>
<li>Port Chester’s Rabin said that approximately 5,000 units of housing have been approved in the village, which includes approximately 500 affordable units (at 60% AMI) based on the village’s recently adopted form-based code.</li>
<li>MacQuesten Development’s Apicella said that demand for multifamily housing is still very strong. He noted that for its latest mixed-use, affordable project at 1510 Broadway in Brooklyn, his firm received 60,000 qualified applications for its 108 units.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[OneKey MLS has emerged as the go-to-location for essential data on the New York metro area and is an indispensable resource for real estate professionals and consumers across the region it serves.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY—It was five years ago this month that OneKey MLS®, went live for the first time to more than 42,000 Realtor subscribers. Since that time, OneKey has grown and adapted to many social and economic changes and challenges, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began at the same time as its launch, as well as the radical changes that have transpired in the industry and in the diverse markets it serves.</p><p>In that short time, OneKey MLS has emerged as the go-to-location for essential data on the New York metro area and is an indispensable resource for real estate professionals and consumers across the region it serves—Long Island, Manhattan and the Hudson Valley.</p><p>OneKey, which was formed by the merger of the multiple listing services owned by the Long Island Board of Realtors and the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, went live to consumers in June 2020 and first offered more than 41,000 listings in 500 communities in the New York metro region.</p><p>Originally headed by CEO Jim Speer, OneKey’s current CEO Richard Haggerty was at first the president of OneKey, while serving as CEO of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. He replaced Speer upon his retirement in September 2022.</p><p>To mark OneKey’s five-year milestone, <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> reached out to longtime HGAR member Mark Boyland, who was one of OneKey MLS’s founding Board of Managers. Other HGAR members that served on the original OneKey MLS Board of Managers were Leah Caro, Nancy Kennedy and Renee Zurlo.</p><p>OneKey officials noted that Boyland, an Associate Broker with Keller Williams in Bedford, played a critical role in shaping OneKey’s vision and ensuring that it remains committed to integrity, service and innovation. He is the current chairperson of the OneKey MLS’ Board of Managers.</p><p>In addition to being a top performing Realtor, from 2007 to 2009, he served as President of the Multiple Listing Service and as Director of the National Association of Realtors. During his time as Director of the Hudson Gateway MLS—from 2009 to 2014—he traveled the US as a national real estate speaker and trained more than 1,500 real estate professionals to sell their clients’ properties in a challenging and shifting market.</p><p>Other HGAR members who currently serve on the OneKey MLS Board are Leah Caro of Park Sterling Realty of Bronxville; Pati Holmes of Julia B. Fee Sotheby International Realty of Rye and Mary Stetson of Stetson Real Estate of Mamaroneck.</p><p>The following are excerpts from Real Estate In-Depth’s conversation with OneKey MLS Board of Managers Chairman Boyland.</p><p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth: </strong>Take us back five years ago and your feelings about helping launch OneKey MLS?</p><p><strong>Boyland: </strong>It was very exciting to merge those two MLSs—Hudson Gateway and Long Island—it was a big deal. I think at the time when we merged, we became the fifth largest MLS... Back then, a good amount of my focus was on the public portal and there were a lot of discussions surrounding that. I was involved in everything including picking the name OneKey. We worked with consultants to determine the name, the mission and the vision and the public portal and how that was going to function and how that was going to be competitive beyond my real estate space. We just wanted to give as much value to our members as possible.</p><p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What makes OneKey MLS an essential tool for real estate professionals?</p><p><strong>Boyland:</strong> Any producing Realtor is on the system every single day. The obvious benefit is it allows us to search for real estate for them (buyers) and research data for them so that when they are making an offer on a property, we can provide them with a sense of value based on what is selling in the area and what is similar. On the listing side, the same thing, we are meeting with clients and we have to provide them with information to make good decisions on pricing their homes and the collective data showing months of supply, inventory, average median sale prices, days on market, list data and closed date. All those things, all that data is really important to educate our clients to make good decisions…</p><p>It's a big resource and just tapping into the data and having the listings are just one part of it. There is more to that because you have your IDX feeds. When I go back and think about the early days of Internet posting, when if you had to post a listing, you had to go on to individual websites to post the same data. Now, that data is fed into these marketing sites, your CMA software and other software programs automatically, so it eliminates a lot of data entry. And having it on (OneKey) MLS also helps the agents make sure that the data is correct because our membership is pretty keen….</p><p>We spend a significant amount of money to make sure that we have the best technology, a system that is reliable, moves fast and maintains accuracy. We also add on different products to the MLS to make our members more productive. For example, we have the showing service (Showing Time) that is tied in, which collectively saves our members thousands of hours each year as opposed to what they used to do which was call each other to book appointments.</p><p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> How does OneKey MLS promote fair housing and equitable access to information?</p><p><strong>Boyland: </strong>The mere fact that anything that goes into the multiple listing service gets populated on thousands of different real estate websites and portals, whether they are broker-owned sites or third-party sites or agent-driven sites. That is full exposure to the entire market so there is no one that is not gaining access. No one is shut out. The challenge that we see in the marketplace is we do see some brokerages that are moving toward private networks or in-house listing systems and that is shutting people out because they don’t have access to that or are even aware that is an option to go that route. So, they are missing out on that real estate and it is also hurting the home seller because they may be under the impression that somehow there is a benefit to not exposing it (the listing) to the entire world, but in fact when you reduce the exposure of any product you are trying to sell, the value of that product is compromised.</p><p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth: </strong>How does OneKey MLS help agents demonstrate their professionalism?</p><p><strong>Boyland: </strong>Well, I think it goes to having that accurate data. Having the data to be able to go into a seller’s home or meet with a buyer and show them what is really happening in the market in real time adds trust and value to that agent and their client. The other part is that everybody is trying to make their listing as good as the next guy. So, there is competition there. I want to make sure my photos are better than the other agent, I want to make sure that the data is more accurate, the write-up is better, along with the attachments and floor plans. It raises, it elevates everybody’s professionalism because we are all trying to compete and look as good as the next person.</p><p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> What resources does OneKey MLS provide to help its customers stand out?</p><p><strong>Boyland:</strong> We have a service called InfoSparks that is linked to the MLS that you can click on above any listing and it will pull up the stats for the town or municipality for that listing. So, you can see a chart and a graph and you can customize it based on bedrooms and baths and your style of home and price range. It has everything there from median average sale price, average pending price, how many new listings there are, closed sales, days on market, percent of list price, percent of original price, dollar volume. There are so many pieces of information but the cool thing with InfoSparks is you can send a live link to the report you created to your client, which updates automatically in real time. That’s huge…</p><p>The other thing we provide to agents is FastStats, which are static reports on the quarterly numbers for the markets. So, an agent can print these out—and they are in full color—or put them on an I-Pad and they can show these really nice reports with charts and graphs showing what is going on in the county to their clients. It is really impressive information.</p><p><strong>Real Estate In-Depth:</strong> How does OneKey MLS align with the values of integrity, collaboration, and innovation?</p><p><strong>Boyland: </strong>I would say that in terms of integrity, we are very focused on providing accurate data. The members make sure that the data is accurate whether they are putting something in or they are notifying the MLS that there is misinformation or a mistake. Collaboration is huge. Everyone has buyers that need something and we all collaborate. When you list something, my buyers have access to it and when I list something, your buyers have access to it. When I list something, I want your buyers to come so that collaboration means a better price and a quicker sale for my client. And, that is really what it is all about is that collaboration.</p><p>In terms of innovation, we are well aware that there are a lot of changes happening in the industry and in the tech space and we are constantly looking at new tools and new ways of doing things. We look at other MLSs across the country that are successful offering new technologies and strategies and we seriously consider those. And, if they seem like they will be a good fit for us here, we are going to roll those in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The New York State Department of State has established clear guidelines for real estate brokers regarding the content that must be publicly available on their brokerage websites.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a real estate licensee in New York State, compliance with the Department of State’s Rules and Regulations is not just a legal requirement—it is the cornerstone of ethical and professional practice. These regulations are designed to protect consumers, ensure fair business practices, and promote accessibility and equity in housing.</p><p>Among some of the critical obligations for real estate licensees is the requirement to maintain a compliant brokerage website, including specific notices and links, as well as adhering to strict prohibitions on the use of corporate titles. A failure to adhere to these requirements leaves licensed brokers and their affiliated licensees open to significant fines and a potential revocation or suspension of their real estate license.</p><h3 id="website-requirements-essential-links-and-notices">Website Requirements: Essential Links and Notices</h3><p>The New York State Department of State has established clear guidelines for real estate brokers regarding the content that must be publicly available on their brokerage websites. These requirements are rooted in the need for transparency, consumer protection, and adherence to federal and state laws. Key notices and links are found below that must be included on the brokerage’s website, ensuring they are accessible and up to date.</p><p><em>Standards Operating Procedures Notice</em></p><p>Under New York Real Property Law Section 442-h [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4215FMn">https://bit.ly/4215FMn</a>], real estate brokers are required to institute standardized operating procedures (SOPs) that outline the prerequisites prospective homebuyers must meet before receiving services. This requirement, effective since April 20, 2022 [<u>see</u> <a href="https://on.ny.gov/3DqQQcP">https://on.ny.gov/3DqQQcP</a>], as explained by the DOS, aims to create consistency and fairness in how brokers engage with clients. The SOPs must address, at a minimum:</p><ul>
<li>Whether prospective clients must show identification.</li>
<li>Whether an exclusive broker agreement is required.</li>
<li>Whether pre-approval for a mortgage loan is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>These procedures must be prominently displayed on the brokerage website and any mobile device applications. Additionally, if there are associated agents or teams operating under your brokerage, their individual websites or applications must either post the SOPs directly or provide a direct link to the procedures on the brokerage firm’s main website.</p><p>It’s not enough to simply draft these procedures—they must be actively maintained and updated. Any changes to the SOPs must be date-stamped, notarized, and posted online within thirty (30) days. Brokers are also required to keep an archive of all versions of their SOPs for as long as they are actively licensed. Failure to adhere to these requirements can result in disciplinary action from the DOS, underscoring the importance of diligence in maintaining compliance.</p><p><em>Tenant’s Rights to Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities Notice</em></p><p>Under the New York State Human Rights Law, tenants and prospective tenants with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to and use of housing. Real estate licensees play a pivotal role in ensuring that these rights are upheld, and part of this responsibility includes making the Tenant’s Rights to Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities Notice (Reasonable Accommodations Notice) prominently available on the brokerage’s website [<u>see</u> <a href="https://dhr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2022/06/466.15-notice-tenants-reasonable-accommodation.pdf">9 New York Code of Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) §466</a>].</p><p>The Reasonable Accommodations Notice informs tenants of their right to request accommodations—such as modifications to policies (e.g., allowing service animals in no-pet buildings) or physical changes to the property (e.g., installing ramps or grab bars)—that enable them to fully enjoy their housing. The notice should also clarify that housing providers are obligated to engage in a good-faith dialogue to determine appropriate accommodations, provided they do not impose undue hardship.</p><p>Including this notice on the brokerage’s website not only fulfills a legal requirement but also signals the brokerage firm’s commitment to fair housing practices. Again, brokerage firms must ensure that this notice is easy to find and consider providing a downloadable PDF version for accessibility.</p><p><em>The Fair Housing Notice</em></p><p>The NYS Housing and Anti-Discrimination Notice, also known as the Fair Housing notice [<u>see</u> <a href="https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/03/nys-housing-and-anti-discrimination-notice_02.2025.pdf">nys-housing-and-anti-discrimination-notice_02.2025.pdf</a>], is another mandatory element that must be prominently displayed on the brokerage’s website. This notice underscores the obligation to comply with both the federal Fair Housing Act and the New York State Human Rights Law, which prohibit discrimination in housing based on protected characteristics, including race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, familial status, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status and lawful source of income.</p><p>In order to comply, brokerages must ensure the notice is clearly labeled, easy to locate, and includes contact information for the New York State Division of Human Rights and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for filing complaints. This not only meets regulatory requirements but also serves as an educational tool for clients, helping them understand their rights, and the broker’s and agent’s obligations as licensees.</p><h3 id="practical-tips-for-website-compliance">Practical Tips for Website Compliance</h3><p>Maintaining a compliant brokerage website requires more than just posting the required notices—it demands ongoing vigilance and strategic design. Here are some practical tips to ensure the website meets DOS standards:</p><p><strong>Visibility and Accessibility</strong>: Ensure all required notices and links are prominently displayed at the top of the broker’s website’s homepage (i.e., “above the fold”) or in a dedicated “Compliance” or “Consumer Resources” section with prominent links at the top of the homepage. It is important to utilize clear, conspicuous, and user-friendly language to make the information accessible to all visitors, including those with disabilities.</p><p><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Review your website regularly to ensure all notices and links are current, especially if laws or regulations change. For example, updates to fair housing protections or ADA requirements may necessitate revisions to the notices.</p><p><strong>Mobile Optimization</strong>: With the increasing use of mobile devices, ensure the website and all required notices are fully functional and readable on all mobile platforms utilized by brokers, associate brokers, and licensees affiliated with a particular brokerage firm. This is particularly important for SOPs, which must be accessible on mobile applications.</p><p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Keep detailed records of all website updates, including date-stamped and notarized versions of the SOPs, to demonstrate compliance in case of a DOS audit or investigation.</p><h3 id="prohibition-on-the-use-of-corporate-titles">Prohibition on the Use of Corporate Titles</h3><p>In addition to website requirements, New York State real estate licensees must adhere to strict prohibitions on the use of corporate titles. Under the DOS Rules and Regulations, real estate brokers and salespersons are barred from using corporate titles such as “president,” “vice president,” “executive vice president,” “secretary,” “treasurer,” among others, in connection with their real estate activities, unless they are duly authorized officers of a licensed real estate corporation. This prohibition is designed to prevent confusion among consumers and ensure that titles accurately reflect a licensee’s role and authority.&nbsp; The only titles that a licensee is permitted to utilize are the following: (1) real estate broker, (2) associate real estate broker, or (3) real estate salesperson, as applicable.</p><p>This requirement underscores the importance of transparency in real estate dealings. Misrepresenting the role or authority can erode consumer trust and expose licensees to disciplinary action from the DOS, including fines, license suspension, and/or revocation. To ensure compliance, review all marketing materials, website content, and professional communications to confirm that no prohibited titles are used. It is important to consult with legal counsel or the DOS to clarify obligations with respect to the use of titles other than those permitted by the DOS.</p><h3 id="dos-fines-and-sanctions-can-be-substantial">DOS Fines and Sanctions Can Be Substantial</h3><p>Under Article 12-A of the Real Property Law, specifically Section 441-c, the DOS can impose fines, revoke, suspend, or reprimand a real estate broker or salesperson for violations, including untrustworthy conduct or breaches of advertising and disclosure regulations. The NYS DOS has wide discretion in determining penalties, but the law does not specify exact fine amounts for each type of violation, such as website notice requirements or misuse of titles.</p><p>While exact fine ranges for these specific violations are not publicly codified in a single source, disciplinary actions by the DOS typically result in fines that can range from $500 to $2,000 for each violation, depending on the circumstances. More severe or repeated violations may lead to higher fines, license suspension and/or revocation.</p><h3 id="compliance-is-critical">Compliance is Critical</h3><p>Compliance with the New York State Department of State’s Rules and Regulations is a non-negotiable aspect of being a real estate licensee. By ensuring the brokerage website includes the required notices, one not only meets legal obligations but also demonstrates a commitment to ethical practice and consumer protection. Similarly, adhering to the prohibition on corporate titles reinforces transparency and trust in the firm’s professional dealings.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Reviewing February’s closed sales of single-family homes, only Rockland County and The Bronx saw gains of 7.1% and 4.2%, respectively.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Median sales prices of single-family homes in the Bronx and the lower Hudson Valley all experienced increases in February, and Putnam County led the way with a 13.4% gain. Putnam’s new median stands at $535,000, as compared to $467,500 in February 2024. Orange County homes presented a close second place, with median prices rising by 12.5% to a new high of $478,500, over $425,000 last year. Sullivan County’s condo median prices, meanwhile, soared by almost 60% to $150,000, over just $95,000 in February 2024.</p><p>Reviewing February’s closed sales of single-family homes, only Rockland County and The Bronx saw gains of 7.1% and 4.2%, respectively. Sales in all other regions declined, with Sullivan County taking the biggest hit at 31.4%. Rockland County held first place in closed condo sales with a 66.7% increase. In all other regions, condo and co-op sales declined, with The Bronx condo sales plummeting by 47.6%.</p><p>Inventory for almost all property types was mixed across the region. Sullivan County’s single-family home inventory grew by 1.9% and The Bronx, by 1.7%. Sullivan, which rarely offers condos, experienced an inflated 500% growth rate in condo inventory, from just one last year to six last month. New listings declined in most regions, with the exception of The Bronx, showing a 20.4% increase for single-family homes and a 7.4% hike for co-ops.</p><p>The report released on March 20th by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR) is based on data supplied by OneKey® MLS. </p><blockquote>“We continue to experience greater demand than supply for housing in the Hudson Valley, a reality that continues to drive increases in home values,” said Lynda Fernandez, HGAR CEO. “Higher interest rates and low inventory will continue to impact sales activity and affordability, particularly for first-time and lower-income consumers.”</blockquote><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Sales of single-family homes in the Bronx saw a slight uptick at 4.2%, while sales of condos dropped by 47.6% and co-ops by 4.3%.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales ascended in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. For both monthly and year-over-year sales, two major U.S. regions experienced growth, one region remained stable and the other registered a decline.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—progressed 4.2% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.26 million in February. Year-over-year, sales slid 1.2% (down from 4.31 million in February 2024).</p><p>“Home buyers are slowly entering the market,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Mortgage rates have not changed much, but more inventory and choices are releasing pent-up housing demand.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of February was 1.24 million units, up 5.1% from January and 17% from one year ago (1.06 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.5-month supply at the current sales pace, identical to January and up from 3.0 months in February 2024.</p><p>“On a technical note, raw sales in February were down 5.2% from last year, which was a leap year with one extra day of business,” Yun added. “However, after adjusting for this effect, combined with the winter seasonal factors, the momentum for home sales is flashing encouraging signs.”</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in February was $398,400, up 3.8% from one year ago ($383,800). All four U.S. regions registered price increases.</p><p>“Each one percentage point gain in home price translates into an approximately $350 billion increase in housing equity for American property owners,” Yun said. “That means a gain of nearly $1.3 trillion in home value appreciation at a time when the current stock market is undergoing a correction. Moreover, the ongoing housing shortage, coupled with historically low mortgage default rates, implies a solid foundation for home values.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2025-02-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-20-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/2025-02-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-20-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/2025-02-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-20-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2025-02-existing-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-20-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 42 days in February, up from 41 days in January and 38 days in February 2024.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 31% of sales in February, up from 28% in January 2025 and 26% in February 2024.

    <description><![CDATA[“My computer model is indicating that (for) home sales, the worst is over. The worst in inventory is over. I think the recession probability is still slim,” Yun said.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—While noting that there are significant headwinds for the real estate industry this year, such as low inventory, high mortgage rates, tariffs and a record federal deficit, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun predicts “the worst is over” in terms of low home sales and high mortgage rates.</p><p>Yun and NAR Senior Economist and Director of Real Estate Research Nadia Evangelou offered a mostly positive outlook on the residential and commercial real estate markets in their “Real Estate and Economic Outlook” virtual presentation on March 21. The two economists predict the housing and office sectors will be in recovery in 2025 with higher sales and lower vacancies respectively.</p><p>“My computer model is indicating that (for) home sales, the worst is over. The worst in inventory is over. I think the recession probability is still slim,” Yun said when releasing a modestly revised forecast for this year.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2021-01-28-Lawrence-Yun-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="525" height="525"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of some of the key metrics, Yun now predicts existing home sales will rise 6% this year and 11% in 2026; new home sales will increase 10% in 2025 and 5% in 2026. The median home sale price is expected to increase overall 3% this year and 4% in 2026. The mortgage rate will average 6.4% this year and 6.1% in 2026 and overall job gains will reach 1.6 million by the end of this year and 2.4 million in 2026.</p><p>In his revised outlook, Yun lowered his GDP forecast from 2.1% growth to 1.7% growth in 2025 and increased his predicted national inflation rate from 2.5% to 2.7% this year.</p><p>Yun noted that a major factor in the high-interest rate environment is the large federal deficit. He said that the Fed rate cuts in September did little to lower mortgage rates. Yun predicted two to three more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve by the end of this year or into early 2026 that will result in perhaps moderate rate reductions if inflation is kept in check. However, unless tangible measures are taken to reduce the more than $35-trillion federal deficit, the market will continue to see rates in the 6% range this year and in 2026, Yun warned.</p><p>On a positive note, Yun related that although home sales have suffered in the last two years, real estate values are near or at record levels in many markets across the country.</p><p>In regards to the persistent low inventory, Yun said, “We are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel,” as for-sale inventory has risen in recent months. However, for the moment, the new home sector has sufficient inventory for sale, while the existing home sales market’s inventory remains at low levels that are insufficient to meet buyer demand.</p><p>In terms of economic policy, Yun said tariffs are inflationary, but deregulation has the potential for being disinflationary.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/Headshot_Nadia.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/Headshot_Nadia.jpg 600w"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NAR Senior Economist and Director of Real Estate Research Nadia Evangelou</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>NAR’s Evangelou said the office market is finally showing some signs of improvement, while the multifamily sector, which is overbuilt in some markets, faces some challenges in 2025.</p><p>She noted that the national office market posted positive absorption of 2.3 million square feet in the first quarter of 2025, reversing negative absorption rates in 2024. It should be noted that in the first quarter of 2015 (pre-pandemic) the national office space absorption stood at 76.6 million square feet. The national office vacancy rate at the end of the first quarter of 2025 was slightly lower at 13.8%. Ten years earlier it stood at 10.6%.</p><p>New York City was a standout performer in the office market, posting 6.5 million square feet of positive absorption at the end of the first quarter of 2025 as compared to a year earlier. Pre-pandemic, New York City was averaging 3.0 million square feet of positive absorption during that same one-year period.</p><p>Evangelou said that despite headlines of corporate downsizing programs, “We are also seeing that there is still significant demand for office space in the nation’s largest business hub,” she said. “And office fundamentals in New York City are on the upswing.”</p><p>In terms of the multifamily sector, Evangelou reported that at the end of the first quarter of 2025, the national vacancy rate rose to 8.1%, while rent growth remained relatively flat at 1.1%. In the first quarter of 2015, the multifamily vacancy rate stood at 6.3% and rent growth was 3.5%.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The policy introduces a new category of exempt listings called “delayed marketing exempt listings.”]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHICAGO—Following what the association termed was an “in-depth assessment of the Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP)”, the National Association of Realtors announced earlier today (March 25) that while it is retaining the CCP, it is now offering a new policy, “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers,” to complement its existing MLS policies.</p><p>“Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” will exist in conjunction with CCP and other MLS policies to provide sellers and their agents more options and choice when marketing a property, while also supporting fair housing by providing buyers and their agents with equal access to important MLS property information, NAR officials stated.</p><p>The policy—developed following many months of consultation with MLS and association leadership, brokerages, agents, multi-cultural organizations, and industry experts—introduces a new category of exempt listings called “delayed marketing exempt listings.” The exemption will allow a seller the option to instruct the listing agent to delay marketing a listing through Internet Data Exchange (IDX) and syndication for a period of time. Each MLS (OneKey MLS in the HGAR market area) will have discretion to determine a delayed marketing period that is most suitable for their local marketplace.</p><p>During the delayed marketing period, the home seller and the listing agent can market the listing in a manner consistent with the seller’s needs and interests. At the same time, the delayed marketing exempt listing will still be available to other MLS Participants through the MLS Platform. Listing agents representing sellers who choose to delay the public marketing of their listing must secure from their seller a signed disclosure documenting the seller’s informed consent to waive the benefits of immediate public marketing through IDX and syndication. Seller disclosure is required for both delayed marketing exempt listings and office exclusive exempt listings.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2024-lt-kevin-sears-full-size-headshot-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NAR President Kevin Sears</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>NAR President Kevin Sears said, “NAR continually reviews its MLS policies to ensure they best serve its members and their consumers while also mitigating and avoiding potential legal risks. As such, NAR undertook a comprehensive review of CCP as part of our efforts to ensure home sellers and home buyers have the information and flexibility they need to make decisions that work for them. These policy changes allow for greater choice for sellers in marketing their properties while considering buyers' need to access information through MLSs. NAR is grateful for our members' engagement throughout this process, and we are pleased to have reached an outcome that balances the needs and perspectives of our diverse membership.”</p><blockquote>Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez said, “NAR's decision to retain and enhance CCP by adopting the new Multiple Listing Options for Sellers will have positive repercussions for both buyers and sellers. Buyers will continue to have equitable, fair, and transparent access to listings while offering sellers more flexibility in how brokers and agents market their properties.”</blockquote><p>“Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” is effective today, March 25, 2025, and must be implemented by Sept. 30, 2025, allowing for technical changes associated with this new seller option of delayed marketing exempt listings. Prior to local implementation, NAR encourages MLSs to consult with brokers and stakeholders in their market to get their input on the allowed time period for delayed marketing exempt listings.</p><p>The new policy does not change an MLS's local mandatory submission deadlines or CCP and its requirement to file a listing with the MLS within one (1) business day from public marketing.</p><p>NAR is also clarifying its policy interpretation that one-to-one, broker-to-broker communications about listings do not trigger CCP requirements. However, multi-brokerage communications about a listing will constitute public marketing under CCP.</p><p>Realtor Magazine reports that both the CCP and the new policy statement, “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers,” are part of NAR’s Handbook on Multiple Listing Policy, which guides Realtor associations in the operation of MLSs. The rules are designed to permit optimum service and efficiency in MLS systems.</p><p>To educate members on these changes, NAR launched new resources for “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” on facts.realtor, which will be continually updated and augmented to meet member needs.</p><p>For an in-depth look at the decision to retain the CCP and further details of the new “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” read the Realtor Magazine article “NAR Introduces New Flexibility for Sellers While Retaining Clear Cooperation Policy at: <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/nar-introduces-new-flexibility-for-sellers-while-retaining-clear-cooperation-policy">https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/nar-introduces-new-flexibility-for-sellers-while-retaining-clear-cooperation-policy</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Buyers paid 14.4% as a share of purchase price and $29,900 on average in 2024, up from 14.2% and $27,200 in 2023.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—The typical down payment in the fourth quarter was $30,250, according to a new report released today (March 27) from Realtor.com, ever-so-slightly below the third quarter's level but roughly $3,000 higher than one year prior. Last year saw the highest down payments in the data's history, both as a dollar amount and as a share of purchase price. Down payments were 3.4 percentage points higher than pre-pandemic (2019 Q4) in the fourth quarter of 2024, emphasizing the trend toward bigger down payments.</p><blockquote>“As inventory recovers, the housing market is very slowly tilting toward more balance between buyers and sellers. But down payments are still high—hitting an annual record in 2024,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com. “Today's home sales are skewed toward higher-end homes, and this means larger down payments from more financially prepared, high-earning buyers as entry-level and lower-earning buyers sit out. Additionally, higher mortgage rates give homebuyers good reason to limit their loan size and interest costs by putting more down upfront. As long as the market remains tilted toward buyers who are less sensitive to home prices and mortgage rates, down payments are likely to remain relatively high.”</blockquote><p>Buyers paid 14.4% as a share of purchase price and $29,900 on average in 2024, up from 14.2% and $27,200 in 2023, and as the housing market is not expected to shift dramatically in the coming months, recent down payment trends are likely to persist.</p><h3 id="homebuyers-utilize-pandemic-era-savings-and-home-equity">Homebuyers Utilize Pandemic-Era Savings and Home Equity</h3><p>Homebuyers have been utilizing pandemic-era savings to fuel consumer spending and larger down payments. In the three years before the pandemic, consumers saved 6.5% of their disposable income; however, during the pandemic that number spiked to over 30% and was above the pre-pandemic norm for more than 20 months.</p><p>Despite a lower savings rate since the pandemic highs, which would normally suggest buyers would have a harder time saving for a large down payment, the typical down payment dollar amount is still more than double the pre-pandemic median, and the typical down payment as a share of purchase price was more than three percentage points higher.</p><p>Still-large accumulations of pandemic savings likely help some homebuyers, especially buyers who also have the benefit of near-record high existing home equity that can boost a down payment, as well.</p><h3 id="down-payment-trends-vary-by-home-price-point">Down Payment Trends Vary by Home Price Point</h3><p>Housing activity is growing in the high-priced segment while shrinking in lower-priced segments, which has pushed the median sale price and median down payment amount higher. Home sales picked up in the $750,000-plus price range in 2024 by 7.4%, while fewer homes sold for less than $750,000 compared to 2023, down 9.3%.</p><p>Modest down payments, those typically used by a first-time home buyer or buyers utilizing government-backed loan options such as FHA or VA-loans, saw growth in payments as well but are below the pandemic peak.</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2024, the 30th percentile down payment, a good proxy for modest down payments, was $8,200, less than one-third of the median down payment amount, up 6.5% year-over-year, but down from the peak in the second quarter of 2022 at $10,300. The highly competitive pandemic-era market pushed even the low end of down payments much higher as buyers paid more as a means of competition and as a result of the pandemic-era boost in savings. Pre-pandemic 2019, the typical modest down payment was $4,600, nearly $4,000 below what was seen in 2024.</p><p>“As mortgage rates ease, a more diverse set of buyers, in terms of budgets, will likely enter the market, and the incentive to minimize their home loan will soften,” said Hale. “However, if for-sale inventory fails to keep up with increased buyer demand, down payments could climb once again as the result of increased competition.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales improved 2.0% in February, the National Association of Realtors reported on March 27. The Northeast and West experienced month-over-month losses in transactions—with a larger decrease in the West—while the Midwest and South saw gains, which were greatest in the South. Year-over-year, contract signings dropped in all four U.S. regions, with the Midwest undergoing the greatest reduction.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index grew 2.0% to 72.0 in February. Year-over-year, pending transactions declined 3.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><blockquote>“Despite the modest monthly increase, contract signings remain well below normal historical levels,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “A meaningful decline in mortgage rates would help both demand and supply—demand by boosting affordability, and supply by lessening the power of the mortgage rate lock-in effect.”</blockquote><h3 id="nar-quarterly-economic-forecast">NAR Quarterly Economic Forecast</h3><p>“Considering the Federal Reserve's recent forecast for slower economic growth, we expect mortgage rates to slide moderately lower,” said Yun. “But the current high national debt will prevent mortgage rates from falling drastically—and certainly not to the 4%-to-5% range seen during President Trump's first term.”</p><p>NAR forecasts mortgage rates will average 6.4% in 2025 and 6.1% in 2026. The association expects existing-home sales will rise by 6% in 2025 and accelerate another 11% in 2026. The new-home sales market has plentiful inventory and, therefore, NAR anticipates it will rise by 10% in 2025 and another 5% in 2026. It predicts that the national median home price will increase by 3% in 2025 and 4% in 2026.</p><p>“Home price growth will moderate due to more supply coming onto the market,” added Yun. “Having income and wages rise faster than home prices are welcome to improve affordability.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2025-02-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-27-2025-1000w-1500h-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/2025-02-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-27-2025-1000w-1500h-3.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/03/2025-02-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-03-27-2025-1000w-1500h-3.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI fell 0.9% from last month to 62.8, down 2.5% from February 2024.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—On April 29, members of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors will descend on the state capital here to meet with lawmakers and advocate for a slate of housing policies aimed at expanding homeownership opportunities, increasing transparency in real estate transactions and addressing long-standing discrimination in the housing market. </p><p>The annual Albany Lobby Day serves as a critical forum for real estate professionals to press legislators on issues that impact homebuyers, renters and property owners across New York. With housing affordability at the forefront of the state’s political discourse, this year’s agenda seeks to remove barriers to homeownership while strengthening consumer protections. Since the end of the pandemic, HGAR is proud to have the greatest number of members participating compared to all the other Realtor organizations in the state. HGAR offers complimentary transportation to the capital and typically has members back at the pick-up locations by mid-afternoon.</p><p>Recently, the HGAR Legislative Committee has been finalizing our HGAR’s 2025 Albany agenda. Our list of topics ranges from issues that deal with affordable and fair housing as well as other issues impacting Realtors and consumers. Below are brief explanations of what we will be discussing.</p><h3 id="expanding-access-to-homeownership">Expanding Access to Homeownership</h3><p>One of the top priorities for HGAR is the First-Time Homebuyer Savings Account Program (S.1157/A.5098), a proposal that would allow prospective homeowners to create tax-deductible savings accounts dedicated to purchasing a home. Supporters say the initiative would provide much-needed financial relief for first-time buyers struggling to enter an increasingly competitive market.</p><p>In addition to affordability concerns, Realtors are also advocating broader policies to expand workforce and affordable housing through zoning reforms, tax incentives and streamlined approvals for commercial-to-residential conversions. The push also includes support for legalizing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and basement apartments, which proponents argue would increase housing supply and provide additional rental opportunities.</p><h3 id="protecting-consumers-and-enhancing-transparency">Protecting Consumers and Enhancing Transparency</h3><p>Amid growing calls for greater transparency in real estate transactions, HGAR is backing a measure that would require written buyer representation agreements between brokers and homebuyers. The policy, which has yet to receive a bill number, aims to ensure that consumers fully understand the services provided by their real estate representatives.</p><p>The organization is also championing legislation to combat discrimination in cooperative housing (S.1452/A.4507). The bill would require co-op boards to provide clear timelines for application reviews and written explanations for denial steps that fair housing advocates say would bring much-needed oversight to a process that has long been criticized for its opacity.</p><h3 id="addressing-systemic-bias-in-housing">Addressing Systemic Bias in Housing</h3><p>Housing discrimination remains a pressing concern, and HGAR is pushing for stronger enforcement against bias in home appraisals, which has been linked to racial disparities in property valuations. A provision included in the governor’s executive budget seeks to increase penalties for discriminatory appraisals, with Realtors advocating for fines that exceed the current $2,000 cap.</p><p>Additionally, the group is calling for action to curb rising insurance premiums, particularly policies that disproportionately impact affordable housing units or tenants receiving government assistance. Advocates argue that insurance companies should not be allowed to hike premiums based on a renter’s source of income.</p><h3 id="a-call-to-action">A Call to Action</h3><p>With New York’s housing crisis continuing to dominate legislative discussions, HGAR members should be eager to make their case in Albany. This is a pivotal moment for housing policy in New York. We need policies that make homeownership more accessible, protect buyers and ensure fair treatment for all New Yorkers. We hope that you can join us on April 29 and make your voice heard.</p><p>HGAR’s Albany Lobby Day will take place on April 29, 2025, bringing together Realtors and housing advocates for a day of meetings with lawmakers. Registration is open now. <a href="https://www.hgar.com/events/find-an-event?event=LB042925&ref=realestateindepth.com" rel="noreferrer">www.hgar.com/events</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The report revealed that 24% of recent home buyers were purchasing for the first time, a significant drop from 32% last year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—In a shift that underscores changing dynamics in the housing market, baby boomers now make up the largest generational group of home buyers, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>NAR's 2025 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends report, which examines the similarities and differences among recent home buyers and sellers across generations, found that the combined share of younger boomers (ages 60–69) and older boomers (ages 70–78) rose to 42% of all home buyers in the past year. Millennials dropped to 29% of all buyers—down notably from 38% a year ago. Generation X buyers (ages 45–59) held steady at 24%.</p><blockquote>“In a plot twist, baby boomers have overtaken millennials—the largest U.S. population—to become the top generation of home buyers,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “What's striking is that half of older boomers and two out of five younger boomers are purchasing homes entirely with cash, bypassing financing altogether.”</blockquote><p>While older buyers were more likely to pay cash, younger generations were much more likely to rely on financing and family support. More than 90% of buyers 44 years and younger financed their home purchase. Twenty-seven % of younger millennials (ages 26-34) and 13% of older millennials (ages 35-44) cited a gift from a relative or friend as one of the sources for their down payment.</p><p>The report revealed that 24% of recent home buyers were purchasing for the first time, a significant drop from 32% last year. First-time buying was most common among younger millennials (71%), while older millennials are now more likely to be repeat buyers.</p><p>“Older millennials are buying bigger and newer homes with larger down payments than their younger counterparts,” Lautz added. “This shift reflects the increasing role of equity in enabling repeat purchases, especially among older generations, while younger buyers continue to face affordability challenges.”</p><p>Generation X home buyers continued to lead all generations with a median household income of $130,000, followed by older millennials at $127,500.</p><p>Seventeen percent of all home buyers purchased a multigenerational home—up from 14% last year. Generation X led the way, with 21% choosing multigenerational living, followed by younger boomers at 15%.</p><p>“Gen Xers are today’s sandwich generation,” said Lautz. “They are purchasing multigenerational homes to accommodate aging relatives, children over the age of 18 and even for cost savings. While Gen X are purchasing at the highest household incomes, they may still feel the squeeze as they aim to find a home that serves everyone.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Generation Z—though still a small segment of the market (3% of all buyers)—had the highest share of single-female home buyers at 30%, and like millennials, they tend to purchase older homes compared to other age groups.</p><p>“Gen Z is slowly entering the housing market with the lowest household income and they’re more likely to be single than other buyers,” Lautz noted.</p><p>Nearly nine out of 10 buyers (88%) purchased their homes with the help of a real estate agent. Younger millennials (90%) were the most likely to use an agent. Referrals remain the primary method most buyers use to find their agent. Referrals by friends, neighbors or relatives were higher among younger millennials (54%) and older millennials (42%) compared to older generations, who were more likely to work with an agent they had previously used to buy or sell a home.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of buyers—88%—said they would use their real estate agent again or recommend them to others. This sentiment was even stronger among Generation X buyers (91%) and those in the Silent Generation (93%), underscoring the enduring value of professional guidance across generations.</p><p>On the selling side, baby boomers again dominated, accounting for 53% of all sellers. Across all generations, sellers stayed in their homes for a median of 10 years. Younger millennials remained more mobile, typically selling after five years, while older boomers sold after 16 years.</p><p>Ninety percent of home sellers worked with a real estate agent, and homes typically sold for 100% of the final list price. Younger millennials were the most likely to use an agent (94%) and often saw the strongest returns—27% sold their homes for 101% to 110% of the list price, and 13% sold for more than 110% of the list price.</p><p>NAR mailed a 127-question survey to 167,750 recent home buyers in July 2024 using a random sample weighted to be representative of sales on a geographic basis. Home buyers had to have purchased a primary residence home between July 2023 and June 2024. The survey received 5,390 responses from primary residence buyers. After accounting for undeliverable questionnaires, the survey had an adjusted response rate of 3.2%.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The top remodeling projects that Realtors recommend sellers complete before listing their homes include painting the entire home (50%), painting a single interior room (41%) and installing new roofing (37%).]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Top remodeling projects for homeowner satisfaction and cost recovery continue to vary as individuals remodel their homes for diverse reasons, according to the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of the Remodeling Industry's 2025 Remodeling Impact Report released on April 9.</p><p>The report assesses the reasons homeowners undertake remodeling projects, the outcomes of these projects and the increased happiness experienced in the home once a project is completed. This year's report features a significantly different structure compared to prior editions, with expanded sections about Realtors and consumers.</p><p>Americans spent an estimated $603 billion on home remodeling projects in 2024.</p><p>According to the report, the remodeling projects that received the highest Joy Scores – a ranking from 1 to 10 based on the happiness homeowners reported upon completion—include the addition of a primary bedroom suite (10), a kitchen upgrade (10) and new roofing (10). In contrast, the remodeling projects with the highest cost recovery—as estimated by members of NARI—include a new steel front door (100%), closet renovation (83%) and new fiberglass front door (80%).</p><p>“Homeowners undertake remodeling projects for numerous reasons, but what remains intriguing is the disparity between the joy experienced post-remodel and the actual cost recovery,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “While homeowners take pride in seeing their personal tastes and design choices come to life, Realtors may recommend different strategies to enhance the property’s resale value."</p><p>The top remodeling projects that Realtors recommend sellers complete before listing their homes include painting the entire home (50%), painting a single interior room (41%) and installing new roofing (37%). Additionally, the projects for which Realtors have observed the highest increase in demand are a kitchen upgrade (48%), new roofing (43%) and a bathroom renovation (35%).</p><p>When consumers remodel their homes, the primary reasons include upgrading worn-out surfaces, finishes and materials (27%); improving energy efficiency (19%); desiring a change (18%) and preparing to sell within the next two years (18%).</p><p>“This report demonstrates that demand for remodeling remains robust, with 42% of NARI members experiencing an increase in contracting projects and 57% observing larger project scopes over the past two years,” says NARI President Jason Hensler. “Homeowners are discovering significant value and joy in these investments—from smaller upgrades, such as front doors and windows, to major renovations like kitchens and primary suites."</p><p>While housing affordability and rising mortgage rates have been considered potential motivators for home remodeling, most consumers (89%) reported that housing affordability was not a deciding factor in their decisions to remodel. However, for a smaller segment of consumers (9%), housing affordability did serve as a motivating factor for undertaking remodeling projects.</p><p>To finance their remodeling projects, consumers primarily relied on home equity loans or lines of credit (54%), savings (29%) and credit cards (10%).</p><blockquote>“Interestingly, despite the lock-in effect—where low-interest-rate mortgages discourage homeowners from moving—housing affordability isn’t a significant reason why consumers choose to remodel their homes,” added Lautz. "Instead, the substantial housing equity that homeowners have built up over time enables them to invest in transforming their homes while they remain in place."</blockquote><p>Homeowners report that the most important outcomes from remodeling projects are improved functionality and livability (28%); durable and long-lasting results, materials and appliances (23%); and enhanced beauty and aesthetics (23%). Following their remodeling projects, 64% of homeowners expressed a greater desire to be in their homes, while 46% reported increased enjoyment of their living spaces.</p><p>If cost were not a factor, 92% of consumers indicated they would choose to remodel additional areas of their homes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Looking ahead, the second quarter of 2025 is expected to bring a modest increase in listing activity as would-be sellers grow more comfortable with the new normal of interest rates and recalibrated expectations.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RYE BROOK—Despite an atmosphere of uncertainty from rising mortgage rates, stubborn inflation and geopolitical frictions, the residential real estate markets North of NYC exhibited remarkable adaptability and, in many cases, quiet strength in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Houlihan Lawrence Q1 2025 Westchester-Putnam-Dutchess Market Report released on April 14.</p><blockquote>“From south to north, a familiar pattern has re-emerged: as affordability continues to be tested in Southern Westchester, buyer activity has radiated outward. Lower Westchester, historically one of the most competitive areas, saw resilient pricing and a slight uptick in sales,” said Liz Nunan, President &amp; CEO of Houlihan Lawrence.</blockquote><p>“But as inventory remained limited and prices climbed, buyers expanded their search parameters geographically, first into Northern Westchester, then into Putnam, and increasingly into Dutchess. This outward flow has created a subtle ripple effect, with each ring absorbing demand from the one below it,” Nunan added.</p><p>In Westchester County, single-family home sales rose 8.5% in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024. This was accompanied by a 5% increase in the average sale price, which reached $1.18 million. Despite a notable rise in average days on the market, from 39 to 67, the sale-to-list price ratio remained a robust 101.5%, suggesting that well-positioned homes are still finding ready buyers.</p><p>In Putnam County, total sales volume declined 9% versus Q1 2024, but that headline masks a more nuanced reality. Median prices rose 10%, indicating that demand has not disappeared; it has simply shifted upmarket. Mahopac, Carmel, and Brewster remain highly active, with buyers drawn to the relative affordability and quality of life just beyond Westchester’s northern border, the report stated.</p><p>Dutchess County continues to attract interest, particularly in commuter-friendly hubs like Beacon, LaGrange and Red Hook. These areas are benefiting from the same centrifugal force seen elsewhere as affordability narrows in southern Westchester and buyers continue moving north in search of value, space, and long-term upside.</p><p>“Looking ahead, the second quarter of 2025 is expected to bring a modest increase in listing activity as would-be sellers grow more comfortable with the new normal of interest rates and recalibrated expectations. Buyers remain ready, but selective,” Nunan said.</p><p>“In this shifting environment, the connective thread is movement, both literal and strategic. Buyers are moving farther, thinking more holistically, and stretching beyond traditional boundaries. Sellers who recognize and adapt to this reality will continue to find success. As Q1 closes, the tone is one of cautious confidence: grounded in data, shaped by macro forces, and propelled by the enduring desire for home,” Nunan added.</p><h3 id="westchester-putnam-dutchess-markets-at-a-glance-q1-2025-vs-q1-2024">Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess Markets at a Glance<br>(Q1 2025 vs Q1 2024)</h3><h3 id="westchester-county"><br>WESTCHESTER COUNTY</h3><p>Homes Sold: Up 9.4%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 4.5%</p><p><strong>New York City Gateway</strong><br>(Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Pelham, and Yonkers)<br>Homes Sold: Down 1%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 1%</p><p><strong>Lower Westchester</strong><br>(Bronxville, Eastchester, Edgemont, Scarsdale, and Tuckahoe)<br>Homes Sold: Up 6%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 4%</p><p><strong>Rivertowns</strong><br>(Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Hastings, Mount Pleasant, Pleasantville, Tarrytown, Briarcliff Manor, Elmsford, Irvington Ossining, and Pocantico Hills)<br>Homes Sold: Up 20%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 5%</p><p><strong>Greater White Plains</strong><br>(Greenburgh, Valhalla and White Plains)<br>Homes Sold: Up 42%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 13%</p><p><strong>Sound Shore</strong><br>(Blind Brook, Harrison, Mamaroneck, Port Chester, Rye City and Rye Neck<br>Homes Sold: Down 3%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 6%</p><p><strong>Northern Westchester</strong><br>(Bedford, Byram Hills, Chappaqua, Katonah-Lewisboro, North Salem and Somers)<br>Homes Sold: Up 16%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 19%</p><p><strong>Northwest Westchester</strong><br>(Croton-on-Hudson, Hendrick Hudson, Lakeland, Peekskill and Yorktown)<br>Homes Sold: Up 2%<br>Median Sale Price: 0%</p><h3 id="putnam-county">PUTNAM COUNTY</h3><p>(Brewster, Carmel, Garrison, Haldane, Lakeland, Mahopac and Putnam Valley)<br>Homes Sold: Down 8%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 10%</p><h3 id="dutchess-county">DUTCHESS COUNTY</h3><p>Homes Sold: Down 4%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 12.2%</p><p><strong>Southwest Dutchess</strong><br>(Beacon, East Fishkill, Fishkill, La Grange, Poughkeepsie, City of Poughkeepsie and Wappinger)<br>Homes Sold: Down 19%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 12%</p><p><strong>Southeast Dutchess</strong><br>(Beekman, Dover, Pawling and Union Vale)<br>Homes Sold: Up 27%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 5%</p><p><strong>Northwest Dutchess</strong><br>(Clinton, Hyde Park, Milan, Pleasant Valley, Red Hook and Rhinebeck)<br>Homes Sold: Up 9%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 16%</p><p><strong>Northeast Dutchess</strong><br>(Amenia, North East, Pine Plains, Stanford and Washington)<br>Homes Sold: Up 5%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 10%</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS, the leading real estate marketplace serving the New York regional market from Montauk to Manhattan and north through the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains, released its monthly residential statistics for March 2025 on April 15, which reflected a continued competitive market that favors sellers.</p><p>In March, the closed median sale price for single-family homes in the region reached $718,500, an increase of 10.5% from $650,000 in March 2024. Condominium prices also saw a modest rise, with a closed median sale price of $515,000, up 3.6% year-over-year. In contrast, the co-op market experienced a decline, with a closed median sale price of $285,000, down 5% from $300,000 in the same period last year.</p><p>Transactional sales activity remained relatively steady for single-family homes, with closed sales rising 1.4% year-over-year. Meanwhile, closed sales for condominiums and co-ops declined by 4.7% and 8.8%, respectively.</p><blockquote>“As we move into the spring market, we're seeing renewed activity across several counties, particularly in the Bronx and Queens,’ said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “While pricing trends remain varied, the overall market continues to show a steady demand across a wide range of price points.”</blockquote><p>Over the past year, real estate prices across the region have shown varied trends, with some counties experiencing steady growth and others marked by fluctuations. Westchester County consistently leads the market with the highest median sale prices, peaking at $1,031,500 in June 2024 before settling at $860,000 in March 2025. Queens and Nassau also remain strong markets, with median prices consistently in the $800,000+ range, showing moderate growth and relative stability.</p><p>In contrast, Sullivan County represents the more affordable end of the market, with notable volatility—rising from $290,000 in March 2024 to $390,000 in February 2025, then dropping to $355,000 in March 2025. Bronx prices saw a recent spike to $710,000, the highest in over a year, suggesting renewed demand or limited inventory.</p><p>Counties like Putnam, Orange, and Dutchess displayed moderate price shifts, generally ranging from the mid-$400,000s to mid-$500,000s, with signs of stabilization in early 2025. These areas may appeal to buyers seeking more affordability without straying too far from downstate urban centers.</p><p><em>OneKey MLS is one of the nation's leading Multiple Listing Services, serving tens of thousands of real estate professionals across Long Island, New York City, and the Hudson Valley. It is owned by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the Long Island Board of Realtors, Inc.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[These requirements aim to balance seller choice with the need for a transparent, cooperative marketplace, ensuring buyers and agents have equitable access to property information.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, the National Association of Realtors introduced the Clear Cooperation Policy, which mandated that properties publicly marketed by Realtors be listed on a Multiple Listing Service within one business day. In response to industry feedback, litigation, and evolving market dynamics, NAR announced a significant update on March 25, 2025, introducing the “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” policy. This update complements the existing CCP, offering sellers greater flexibility while maintaining transparency.</p><h3 id="seller-options-under-the-updated-clear-cooperation-policy">Seller Options Under the Updated Clear Cooperation Policy</h3><p>The updated CCP, effective March 25, 2025, with an implementation deadline of Sept. 30, 2025, introduces a new category called “delayed marketing exempt listings” alongside the existing “office exclusive listings” option. These options provide sellers with more control over how their properties are marketed, addressing privacy concerns and strategic marketing preferences while ensuring compliance with MLS rules.</p><h3 id="delayed-marketing-exempt-listings">Delayed Marketing Exempt Listings</h3><p>The “Delayed Marketing Exempt Listings” option allows sellers to instruct their listing agent to delay public marketing of their property through Internet Data Exchange (IDX) feeds and syndication platforms (e.g., Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com) for a certain period of time to be determined by the local MLSs by Sept. 30<sup>th</sup>. During this time, the listing is filed with the MLS and accessible to other MLS participants (agents and brokers) but not visible to the public on consumer-facing websites. This option allows sellers to test the market discreetly, prepare the property (e.g., staging, renovations), and/or maintain privacy temporarily.</p><p>Sellers must sign a disclosure form acknowledging they are waiving or delaying the benefits of immediate public marketing. This ensures informed consent and transparency about the potential trade-offs, such as reduced exposure to buyers. This option is ideal for sellers who want a strategic pre-marketing phase, such as high-profile individuals, those in sensitive situations (e.g., divorce), or sellers testing pricing without public scrutiny.</p><h3 id="office-exclusive-listings">Office Exclusive Listings</h3><p>The “Office Exclusive Listings” option is also still available to sellers. This option allows sellers to opt for an office exclusive listing, where the property is not disseminated through the MLS to other participants or publicly marketed. Marketing is restricted to within the listing brokerage, typically through direct promotion among the brokerage’s agents and their clients. One-to-one broker-to-broker communications outside the brokerage are also permitted without triggering CCP requirements.</p><p>When electing to have their property marketed via the “office exclusive listing” option, sellers must provide a signed certification confirming they do not want the listing disseminated through the MLS. The listing must still be filed with the MLS but is not shared with other participants unless it is publicly marketed. This option suits those sellers prioritizing maximum privacy (e.g., celebrities, high-profile individuals, etc.) or those individuals in unique personal circumstances, who would like to limit exposure of their property to a select group of buyers.</p><h3 id="listing-requirements-and-time-frames">Listing Requirements and Time Frames</h3><p>Both “Delayed Marketing Exempt Listings” and “Office Exclusive Listings” require the listing to be filed with the MLS, ensuring that even private listings are documented, maintaining the integrity of the MLS as a cooperative platform. If a seller or agent publicly markets the property (e.g., via yard signs, social media, or email blasts), the CCP mandates that it be fully listed on the MLS within one business day, regardless of the chosen option. The CCP and its complementary “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” policy impose strict requirements to ensure transparency and cooperation among MLS participants. Key requirements include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory MLS Submission</strong>: All listings, including delayed marketing exempt and office exclusive listings, must be filed with the MLS. This applies to property types mandated by local MLS rules, typically single-family homes, condominiums, multi-family properties and vacant land.</li>
<li><strong>One Business Day Rule</strong>: If a property is publicly marketed—defined broadly to include yard signs, flyers, digital marketing on public websites, brokerage displays (IDX/VOW), email blasts or multi-brokerage networks—it must be submitted to the MLS for cooperation with other participants within one business day (excluding weekends and holidays). This rule remains unchanged from the original CCP.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure and Certification</strong>: For both delayed marketing exempt and office exclusive listings, brokers must obtain signed documentation from the seller. For delayed marketing, this is a disclosure form outlining the implications of delayed public marketing. For office exclusives, it is a certification that the seller opts out of MLS dissemination.</li>
<li><strong>Local MLS Discretion</strong>: The duration of the delayed marketing period is set by individual MLSs, allowing flexibility based on local market needs. MLSs must come up with an appropriate timeframe before the Sept. 30, 2025 implementation deadline.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Public Marketing Clarification</strong>: One-to-one broker-to-broker communications about a listing do not trigger the CCP’s one-day submission requirement. However, sharing a listing with multiple brokerages constitutes public marketing, requiring immediate MLS submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements aim to balance seller choice with the need for a transparent, cooperative marketplace, ensuring buyers and agents have equitable access to property information.</p><h3 id="brokerage-industry-reaction-to-the-updated-ccp">Brokerage Industry Reaction to the Updated CCP</h3><p>The updated CCP has elicited varied responses from real estate brokerages, reflecting differing business models, market strategies and philosophies on transparency versus seller control. Some brokerages favor the new flexibility (and also desire even more added flexibility), while others are reinforcing strict adherence to public MLS listings.</p><h3 id="redfin-exp-realty-and-zillow-move-to-ban-private-listings">Redfin, eXp Realty and Zillow Move to Ban Private Listings</h3><p>Zillow, eXp Realty and Redfin have come out in recent days and have indicated that they will enact rules banning listings that are not submitted to the MLS and published on listing sites. As Claire Boston, Senior Reporter at <em>Yahoo Finance</em>, states the CCP “and the delayed marketing compromise have sparked fierce debate within the industry.” [<strong><u>See</u></strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/3YxIs2g">https://bit.ly/3YxIs2g</a>]. According to <em>Housingwire, </em>eXp Realty’s CEO, Leo Pareja, has publicly supported the CCP, stating “that he and his firm are ‘putting their money where their mouth is.’” [<strong><u>See</u></strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/43Xnv4q">https://bit.ly/43Xnv4q</a>]. These brokerages argue that private listings risk fragmenting the market, reducing transparency, and potentially violating fair housing principles by limiting access to select groups. They see the MLS as a critical tool for ensuring equitable and widespread access to properties, and enabling competitive bidding.</p><h3 id="brokerages-in-favor-of-private-temporary-off-market-listings"><strong>Brokerages in Favor of Private Temporary Off-Market Listings</strong></h3><p>Compass, one of the largest U.S. real estate brokerage firms, has been a vocal critic of NAR’s original CCP. While Robert Reffkin, CEO of Compass was “pleased” with the changes to the newly updated CCP, <em>Housingwire</em> reports that “he made it clear that these changes were not enough.” [<strong><u>See</u></strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/3Ek5wLd">https://bit.ly/3Ek5wLd</a>]. Compass has been a supporter of private listings and seller privacy rights and choice. Compass has leveraged “Private Exclusive” listings and a large percentage of its active listings are marketed internally before being listed on the MLS. Under the updated CCP, Compass is likely to capitalize on the delayed marketing exempt listings option, which would allow agents to market properties within their network for the MLS-determined delay period. Reffkin has described the updated CCP as a “small step in the right direction” toward greater seller choice, although he advocates for even more flexibility, such as a 30-day (or even greater) unrestricted marketing period.</p><p>Compass and others argue that sellers should have the freedom to control how their properties are marketed, especially in luxury or niche markets where privacy is paramount. They view private listings as a competitive advantage, allowing them to attract clients and potentially close more transactions within their networks.</p><h3 id="nar-resources-regarding-the-new-ccp"><strong>NAR Resources Regarding the New CCP</strong></h3><p>NAR has provided the following information regarding the updated CCP. Key materials and forms include:</p><p>&nbsp;• NAR’s Facts.realtor page on the “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers” policy [<strong><u>see</u></strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/4iooxdo">https://bit.ly/4iooxdo</a>].</p><p>&nbsp;• NAR’s FAQ on Multiple Listing Options for Sellers [<strong><u>see</u> </strong><a href="https://bit.ly/4lwKmtW">https://bit.ly/4lwKmtW</a>].</p><p>&nbsp;• A detailed article on the CCP policy update, which provides context on the development process and industry reactions [<strong><u>see</u></strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/4cvjJRW">https://bit.ly/4cvjJRW</a>].</p><p>&nbsp;R’s video, “Window to the Law: Understanding the MLS Clear Cooperation Policy” [<strong><u>see</u></strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/4jz8kmq">https://bit.ly/4jz8kmq</a> ].</p><h3 id="exempt-listing-disclosure-form-guidelines">Exempt Listing Disclosure Form Guidelines</h3><p>While NAR does not provide a standardized form, it does offer a guideline for MLSs to create disclosure forms for delayed marketing exempt and office exclusive listings. These forms must document the seller’s informed consent and understanding of marketing trade-offs. MLSs are expected to develop these forms by Sept. 30, 2025. NAR provides the following guidance:</p><p>“The filing of an exempt listing (office exclusive or delayed marketing) with the MLS must be pursuant to a certification obtained by the listing broker from the seller which includes:</p><ul>
<li>disclosure about the professional relationship between the Participant and the seller;</li>
<li>acknowledgement that the seller understands the MLS benefits they are waiving or delaying with the exempt listing, such as broad and immediate exposure of their listing through the MLS; and</li>
<li>confirmation of the seller’s decision that their listing not be publicly marketed and disseminated by the MLS as an office exclusive listing or that their listing will not have immediate public marketing through IDX and Syndication as a delayed marketing listing.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>&nbsp;Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The updated Clear Cooperation Policy is NAR’s attempt to balance seller flexibility with the transparency and cooperation that define the MLS system. Sellers can now choose delayed marketing exempt listings or office exclusive listings, but both options require MLS filing and signed disclosures. The one-business-day rule for publicly marketed properties remains a requirement. As the industry adapts by Sept. 30, 2025, ongoing debates and market data will likely shape future iterations of the policy. For Realtors, understanding these options and their implications is critical to serving clients effectively in a dynamic market.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales descended in March, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales slid in all four major U.S. regions. Year-over-year, sales dropped in the Midwest and South, increased in the West and were unchanged in the Northeast.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—fell 5.9% from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million in March. Year-over-year, sales drew back 2.4% (down from 4.12 million in March 2024).</p><blockquote>“Home buying and selling remained sluggish in March due to the affordability challenges associated with high mortgage rates,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Residential housing mobility, currently at historical lows, signals the troublesome possibility of less economic mobility for society.”</blockquote><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of March was 1.33 million units, up 8.1% from February and 19.8% from one year ago (1.11 million). Unsold inventory stood at a 4.0-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.5 months in February and 3.2 months in March 2024.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in March was $403,700, up 2.7% from one year ago ($392,900). All four U.S. regions registered price increases.</p><p>“In a stark contrast to the stock and bond markets, household wealth in residential real estate continues to reach new heights,” Yun said. “With mortgage delinquencies at near-historical lows, the housing market is on solid footing. A small deceleration in home price gains, which was slightly below wage-growth increases in March, would be a welcome improvement for affordability. With real estate asset valuation at $52 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds, each percentage point gain in home prices adds more than $500 billion to the household balance sheet.”</p><h3 id="realtors-confidence-index">Realtors Confidence Index</h3><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 36 days in March, down from 42 days in February but up from 33 days in March 2024.</p><p>First-time buyers were responsible for 32% of sales in March, up from 31% in February 2025 and identical to March 2024.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales increased 6.1% in March – the greatest month-to-month increase since December 2023 (+7.0%), according to the National Association of Realtors. The Northeast experienced month-over-month losses in transactions, while the Midwest, South and West saw gains, which were most substantial in the South. Year-over-year, contract signings grew in the Midwest but fell in the Northeast, South and West—with the Northeast undergoing the greatest decrease.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, rose 6.1% to 76.5 in March. Year-over-year, pending transactions fell by 0.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><blockquote>“Home buyers are acutely sensitive to even minor fluctuations in mortgage rates,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “While contract signings are not a guarantee of eventual closings, the solid rise in pending home sales implies a sizable build-up of potential home buyers, fueled by ongoing job growth.”</blockquote><p>Mortgage rates fell by around 20 to 30 basis points in March from the first two months of this year. The average mortgage rate was 6.65% in March, down from a 6.96% average in January and down from a 6.84% average in February.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/NAR-March-202025-PHS-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/NAR-March-202025-PHS-3.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/NAR-March-202025-PHS-3.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI dropped 0.5% from last month to 62.5, down 3.0% from March 2024. The Midwest index expanded 4.9% to 77.7 in March, up 1.4% from the previous year.</p><p>The South PHSI soared 9.8% to 94.1 in March, down 0.4% from a year ago. The West index climbed 4.8% from the prior month to 58.6, down 2.0% from March 2024.</p><p>“Consumers should note that the spring homebuying season typically brings in a surge of home buyers and sellers compared to the winter months,” added Yun. “In March, signed contracts surged 34.1% from February based on non-seasonally adjusted raw data, reflecting a pattern consistent with previous years. In addition, inventory levels rose by 8.1% in March from the prior month, indicating a more dynamic housing-market environment.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—A group of approximately 75 members of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors joined hundreds of Realtors from across the state at the annual Lobby Day here to promote key consumer and industry-centric legislation to state lawmakers.</p><p>The program, organized by the New York State Association of Realtors, featured private one-on-one sessions between HGAR officials and key state lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D, W-F 35th District) and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-83rd District), and a highly informative give-and-take meeting with a host of state lawmakers from New York City and the Hudson Valley held in a legislative hearing room at the Capitol.</p><p>The HGAR contingent was led by Legislative Committee Co-Chairs Crystal Hawkins-Syska and Matt Engel, as well as HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez, Alexander Roithmayr, Director of Government Affairs, and other HGAR support staff.</p><p>The legislative priorities of HGAR and NYSAR were focused on assisting first-time homebuyers with rising housing costs, helping alleviate the severe housing shortage in New York State, addressing escalating insurance costs that are having an adverse impact on multi-family housing and combating discrimination in cooperative housing purchase transactions and in the appraisal process.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/MAHER-SLATER-PIC.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/MAHER-SLATER-PIC.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/MAHER-SLATER-PIC.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/MAHER-SLATER-PIC.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/MAHER-SLATER-PIC.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Assemblyman Brian Maher and Matt Slater.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>During the meetings with state lawmakers, HGAR officials also expressed their opposition to the expansion of freshwater wetland regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that is creating confusion and will likely result in a significant reduction in development of vacant parcels adjacent to existing wetlands. Several also warned that rising insurance costs could lead to foreclosures of multifamily properties in the Bronx.</p><p>The elected officials that attended Lobby Day and met with the HGAR delegation and discussed key issues included: Senators Jamaal Bailey (D-36th District), Shelley Mayer (D-WF, 37th District), Bill Weber (R-C-38th District) and James Skoufis (D-42nd District) and staff from Senator Jose Serrano (D-W-F, 29th District, and Assembly members: Dana Levenberg (D-95th District), MaryJane Shimsky (D-92nd District), Steven Otis (D-91st District), Matt Slater (R-94th District), Jeffrey Dinowitz (D-81st District), Grace Lee (D-65th District), Patrick Carroll (D-96th District) and Brian Maher (R-101st District).</p><p>HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez said, “Our unwavering commitment to expanding housing opportunities was palpable during this critical time for our industry. Now, more than ever, it is essential to articulate our legislative priorities as we aim to generate housing inventory and facilitate generational access to housing and wealth-building opportunities. Together, our voices can make a significant impact to champion these vital issues for the benefit of our communities and future generations.”</p><p>HGAR President Vlora Sejdi added, “Lobby Day 2025 was no photo op—we came to work. From private sit-downs with Speaker Heastie and Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins to candid conversations throughout the Capitol, we pushed hard for fair housing and real support for first-time homebuyers. This is where the impact happens—if you weren’t there this year, make sure you are next time.”</p><p>HGAR also placed a photo of longtime HGAR Legislative Chairperson Leah Caro in the Assembly meeting room and handed out buttons with her picture in her memory. Caro, who usually led the Lobby Day sessions, passed away on April 6.</p><p>A rather poignant moment occurred when State Senator Mayer took the time to offer her memories of Caro before addressing the HGAR assemblage. “Leah was the voice of HGAR in every way. We had many agreements and disagreements, but she brought all this positive energy for your world, for what you represent and her commitment to the people. She is a very special friend,” Mayer shared.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/SHELLEY-MAYER-PIC.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/SHELLEY-MAYER-PIC.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/SHELLEY-MAYER-PIC.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/SHELLEY-MAYER-PIC.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/SHELLEY-MAYER-PIC.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">State Senator Shelley Mayer</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>The specific legislation supported by the HGAR and NYSAR delegations include:</p><p><strong>New York State First Home Savings Program</strong>: If enacted, the program would provide a state income tax deduction on deposits of up to $10,000 annually for joint filers and $5,000 for individuals when funds are used toward the purchase of a first home in New York State, including townhomes, condos and co-ops. The bill passed the State Senate by a 61-0 vote.</p><p><strong>New York State First Home Grant Program</strong>: The bill, which is in committee in the Assembly and Senate, would provide $10,000 to first-time homebuyers. The bill requires the homebuyer to maintain primary residence of the property for five years.</p><p><strong>Expanding Tax Incentives Statewide for Development of Vacant Properties into Housing</strong>: The bill, which passed the Assembly by a 148-0 vote, would expand the availability of a state tax incentive for the development of vacant properties into one-to-four residential housing units statewide.</p><p><strong>Expanding the SONYMA Low Interest Rate Program</strong>: The bill, which passed the Senate by a 61-0 vote, but is awaiting introduction in the Assembly, would expand program eligibility to graduates of post-secondary education or a comparable apprenticeship or workforce training program. Qualified individuals would be eligible for 30-year mortgages at a rate of 1.5 points lower than standard interest rate offered for a period of 10 years.</p><p><strong>Exempting F Homebuyers from the Mortgage Recording Tax</strong>: The bill, which is in committee in the Assembly and Senate, would exempt first-time homebuyers from the mortgage recording tax to help lower closing costs.</p><p><strong>Require Written Buyer Representation Agreements</strong>: The proposal, which is yet to be introduced, would help increase transparency in the homebuying transaction process.</p><p><strong>Require Sexual Harassment Prevention Training for All Real Estate Licensees</strong>:<strong> </strong>The bill is currently in committee in the Assembly and Senate.</p><p><strong>Prohibiting Long-Term Residential Listing Agreements</strong>: The bill, which is before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but has yet to be introduced in the Assembly, would limit residential listing agreements to no more than two years, with the option to renew if agreed upon, to protect the consumer.</p><p><strong>Increase Real Estate Broker Experience</strong>: The bill, which is in the Judiciary Committee in the Assembly and Senate, would increase the years of experience to obtain a broker’s license to five years. New York’s current requirements are lower than laws in California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to name a few.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/HAWKINS-SYSKA-ALEX-PIC.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/HAWKINS-SYSKA-ALEX-PIC.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/HAWKINS-SYSKA-ALEX-PIC.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/HAWKINS-SYSKA-ALEX-PIC.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/HAWKINS-SYSKA-ALEX-PIC.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, by Legislative Committee Co-Chair Crystal Hawkins-Syska and Alexander Roithmayr, Director of Government Affairs for HGAR.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>HGAR also issued memos in support for:</p><ul>
<li>A bill pending in the Senate and Assembly would seek to prohibit discriminatory practices by real estate appraisers and would enhance fair housing compliance in the state.</li>
<li>A proposal expected to be introduced soon would expand affordable and workforce housing by offering new zoning and tax incentives to encourage residential development, streamline the process for converting commercial properties to residential use, expand accessory dwelling units, legalize basement apartments and enhance education and oversight of local Land Use Boards.</li>
<li>A bill in the Assembly and Senate would exempt cooperative housing from certain landlord-tenant law changes.</li>
<li>A bill in the Senate and Assembly would establish a rental assistance payment standard pilot program. The initiative would allow property owners to charge rents equal to the maximum amounts prescribed by rental assistance programs for comparable housing accommodations, subject to rent reasonableness calculations.</li>
<li>HGAR also issued a memo in support of a solution to address the rising cost of insurance in the residential industry. HGAR stated that it would support a bill that prohibits insurance carriers from increasing premiums on the existence of affordable dwelling units, the receipt of housing assistance or the source of income.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking back on Lobby Day, HGAR’s Roithmayr said, "HGAR had another successful Lobby Day in Albany. It has been an honor to work alongside our Legislative Chairs over the past several weeks to organize such a substantive event. This year posed particular challenges, as the legislative session and budget negotiations limited the availability of our Senators and Assemblymembers. Despite that, we had over two hours of meaningful engagement with our representatives, who took the time to hear and speak to our issues. This is a true testament to the respect HGAR’s advocacy has earned from our state lawmakers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Expatsi, an international research and tour group dedicated to helping people find affordable global living destinations, recently compiled a list of 10 countries where one could easily retire on just $2,000 a month.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—You’ve worked hard all your life and now you’re looking forward to retirement. Maybe you’ll sell your home and relocate, but if you’re on a tight budget, a global location could possibly offer you less expensive options and a better lifestyle.</p><p>According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, the average monthly Social Security retirement benefit this year is $1,976. With home prices and rents still escalating across America, your benefits may be barely enough to cover the costs of living.</p><p>Expatsi, an international research and tour group dedicated to helping people find affordable global living destinations, recently compiled a list of 10 countries where one could easily retire on just $2,000 a month.</p><p>Topping their list is Portugal, which ranks in the top 25% on the healthcare and safety index and seventh on the global peace index. After just three months of living there, expats can access the national healthcare system. Private health insurance is typically available for just 190 Euros ($216) a month for a couple.</p><p>Retirement visas are available for those with a monthly income of at least 760 Euros ($866). After just five years, you can convert your residence into EU citizenship and travel easily throughout Europe.</p><p>Popular areas include the Algarve region in the south, known for beautiful beaches and hot summers. Coastal cities like Lisbon and Porto have milder weather and a wealth of options for arts, food, wine, and culture.</p><p>Antonio Barbosa, a member of NAR as well as FIABCI-USA, the international real estate federation, recommends that anyone interested in living abroad should rent first before jumping into buying something. “If they’ve never been here before, they may want to stay in hotels in different locations to see which areas they like the best,” he said. “Then they can think about renting an apartment for at least six months to experience local life before purchasing.”</p><p>Barbosa is the owner of Infinite Solutions real estate in Valenca, Portugal and is a Certified International Property Specialist. Depending on the region, he said, apartment rents could range from about $700 a month in Minho in the north to $2,000 a month in Lisbon, the capital city located in the southwestern part of the country. “Lisbon and the Algarve can be very expensive, as they are prime tourist areas,” noted Barbosa. “But there are many other beautiful areas off the beaten path that offer more affordable living options.”</p><p>He recently helped a family of five move from Utah to a four-bedroom, four-bath home in the Minho area for just 1,800 Euros per month rent, or $2,054. Both parents are utilizing the country’s “digital nomad” visa, a temporary residence permit allowing non-European citizens to live and work remotely in Portugal for up to one year, with the possibility of extension.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/4-bedroo-cottage.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="568" height="378"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Traditional four-bedroom | three-bath rustic cottage w/pool on three acres sold at 460,000€.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Once expats have an address, they can apply for a loan if they want to purchase property in Portugal. Typically, banks require a 30% down payment and the maximum age for obtaining a mortgage is 75.</p><p>Home prices also vary according to region, from an average of just $100,000 for a one-bedroom condo to $300,000 for a single-family home in a non-tourist area. In heavily touristed regions, the prices for single-family homes can range from $400,000 to over $1 million plus.</p><p>Barbosa indicated that most of Portugal’s expats are from the U.S. and Canada. “The cost of living is a lot lower here, as are taxes on homes, restaurant meals and entertainment,” he said. “Of course, we also have beautiful weather, and Portugal is a very welcoming country.” English is widely spoken there as well.</p><p>Compared with the rest of Europe, Portugal is one of the most affordable European countries. “A typical dinner with wine, dessert and coffee may cost you just over 10 Euros ($11.40),” added Barbosa.</p><p>A former U.S. resident, Barbosa has lived in New York City, New Jersey, Orlando, Chicago and San Francisco. However, he has called Portugal his home for more than 25 years, and his parents also reside there.</p><p>“There are a lot of Americans now who want to live overseas,” said Christina Prostano, Chair of HGAR’s Global Business Council and Principal of the Global Collective Team at Compass in Manhattan. “Some are retiring, others want a more affordable lifestyle and there are those leaving the U.S. due to the political or economic climate.”</p><p>Prostano agrees that Portugal has always been a very popular destination, as more Americans are seeking out a simpler, less stressful lifestyle. “Italy and Spain are also up-and-coming popular retirement locations,” she added. The International Living report recently included Italy, Spain, Greece, and Malaysia as other affordable retirement options.</p><p>“However, English is not as prevalent in Italy or Spain, so U.S. residents might also want to consider other countries such as the Netherlands, where almost everyone speaks English,” added Prostano. “Besides cost-of-living expenses, other concerns are the distance to hospitals and the quality of healthcare.”</p><p>Additional countries on Expatsi’s list of affordable retirement options include Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico in Central America. Costa Rica’s weather ranges from tropical on the coasts to mild in the mountainous regions. Popular destinations include Escazu, Santa Ana, Los Yoses, as well as the central Pacific coast and the Guanacaste region.</p><p>Panama offers similar weather and just a $1,000 a month income qualifies you for a retirement visa. The country’s healthcare includes a John Hopkins medical facility. While Mexico has had its share of negative publicity, the country is currently home to some 62,000 Americans. Mexico City, Lake Chapala and Monterrey are popular areas among retirees. Monthly income requirements are a bit higher at $3,100 to qualify for a retirement visa.</p><p>Fifth on the list is the Czech Republic, which is ranked in the top 10% of countries for safety and healthcare. The nation is also known for its reliable public transportation with easy access to Germany, Austria and Poland. France also offers affordable retirement options outside of Paris. Marseille, the largest city on the French Riviera has been attracting retirees for years, as well as Caen in Normandy. France’s healthcare is ranked in the top 25% of countries.</p><p>Listed at number seven, Thailand has become increasingly trendy for people of all ages. Cities like Chiang Mai, Bangkok and Koh Samui are likely destinations for renters and buyers. The monthly income requirement is also lower here at just $1,825. Studio apartments in the capital city of Bangkok rent for about $600, and one-bedrooms for $500 a month in less populated areas.</p><p>“Thailand can be a great affordable option, with some wonderful deals on apartment rentals,” added Prostano. “You can start planning where you might want to retire globally by taking vacations in different countries and determining which ones best suit your lifestyle.” Prostano’s team receives inquiries all the time about Portugal, Spain and Italy.</p><p>Recently named the “happiest country in the world,” Finland ranked as the eighth best global retirement option. It’s listed in the top 10% for safety and infrastructure and offers free college education and universal healthcare for all. English is widely spoken as well. If you have an income of at least $1,100 a month, Finland might be the place for you. The capital of Helsinki is more expensive, but cities like Espoo, Turku or Tampere offer more affordable choices. The Northern Lights are listed as the best free entertainment.</p><p>Coming in at number nine, the Philippines islands are one of the least expensive countries in the world. Just $800 a month in income will qualify someone for a retirement visa. Americans’ favorite areas are Davao City, Tagaytay or Cebu City. Food and healthcare are also very reasonable.</p><p>Ranked 10 on the list is Uruguay in South America. Located between Argentina and Brazil, the country has four seasons with mild weather year-round. Most newcomers choose to live in Montevideo, the capital on the coast, or resort destinations such as Atlantida and Punta del Este. A monthly retirement income of $1,500 is required.</p><p>Prostano noted that many people interested in eventually retiring to another country will purchase a rental property there first. “That gives them the opportunity to enjoy a vacation home abroad and also monetize the investment by renting it out to tourists,” explained. “They can always decide later if they want to relocate there.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

All rights reserved.</em></p><p>As Congress ramps up work on a sweeping tax reform package, the National Association of Realtors’ Advocacy Scoop podcast dives into what’s at stake for real estate—and what voters think about it.</p><p>In the latest podcast episode, released today, hosts Shannon McGahn, NAR’s executive vice president and chief advocacy officer, and Patrick Newton, the association’s vice president of advocacy communications, walk through the results of a new consumer survey. It reveals broad public support for tax policies that support a healthy housing market.</p><blockquote>“Americans strongly support tax reform solutions that address inflation and help families who are struggling in today’s economy,” says McGahn. “We found more than 80% of voters support key provisions that impact the real estate economy, from deductions for small businesses to incentives for community investment and housing development.”</blockquote><p>Among the survey’s top findings:</p><ul>
<li>92% favor tax-free savings accounts for first-time home buyers.</li>
<li>91% want to preserve tax incentives like the mortgage interest deduction.</li>
<li>86% support keeping lower-income tax rates for individuals and married couples.</li>
<li>83% back the 20% deduction for independent contractors and small businesses earning under $400,000.</li>
<li>67% support raising the capital gains exemption on the sale of a primary residence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The survey also explored the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction issue, a key NAR advocacy priority. The survey found 61% of voters support increasing deduction limits or removing limits altogether.</p><p>The national survey of 1,000 registered voters was commissioned by NAR and conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Hart Research April 3-6, 2025. It has a margin of error of 3.10%.</p><h3 id="taking-the-message-to-capitol-hill">Taking the Message to Capitol Hill</h3><p>In the podcast, McGahn and Newton also preview NAR legislative priorities ahead of the Realtors Legislative Meetings, which take place May 31–June 5 in Washington, D.C. Some 8,000 Realtor members of NAR are expected to attend the conference and many will meet with lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill. With the tax bill debate entering a new phase in Congress, McGahn says, “the timing couldn’t be better for our members to deliver this message in person.”</p><p>In addition to favoring the extension of several tax provisions set to expire this year, NAR is advocating for reforms to unlock housing inventory and expand access to homeownership.</p><p>“There are current homes that could be available—inventory that’s being held back—because of disincentives like the outdated capital gains thresholds,” McGahn says. She’s referring to the maximum capital gain that taxpayers can exclude on the sale of a primary residence, a figure that hasn’t increased since 1997 despite a significant increase in the average home’s value over the past three decades.</p><p>With major decisions in Congress on the horizon, McGahn says, the voter poll “arms Realtors with facts and public opinion to help influence a better outcome for consumers, property owners and the real estate economy.”</p><p>To hear the full polling results, stream the episode online, or listen on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.</p><p><em>About the author: Tori Syrek is the Manager of Advocacy Media at the National Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[After that detailed and thorough consultation, we reached an outcome that promotes individual choice, while also reinforcing a system of openness for all.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors has released a video of NAR President Kevin Sears discussing the newly announced MLS policy and Multiple Listing Options for Sellers.</p><p>The following is the full transcript of Sears’ presentation. To view the video, go to: <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/videos/nar-president-discusses-new-mls-policy">https://www.nar.realtor/videos/nar-president-discusses-new-mls-policy</a>.</p><p><strong>Kevin Sears</strong>: “Hello. I am Kevin Sears, the 2025 President of the National Association of Realtors here to talk about our review of the Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP) and our new MLS policy called “Multiple Listing Options for Sellers.” For some background, we regularly evaluate MLS policies to make sure they serve our members and consumers (and) are minimizing potential legal risk. Our goal since the start of our assessment of CCP eight months ago has been to foster and efficient, fair and transparent real estate market and to help our members carry out their ethical duty to put their client’s interest first. We consulted with stakeholders from across the industry, including MLS leadership, association executives, brokers, agents, our multicultural partners and fair housing, policy, technology and legal experts.</p><p>And after that detailed and thorough consultation, we reached an outcome that promotes individual choice, while also reinforcing a system of openness for all. With that in mind, NAR recently introduced its new MLS policy called ‘Multiple Listing Options for Sellers,’ which creates a new category of exempt listings called ‘Delayed Marketing Exempt Listings.’ This new policy exists alongside CCP and does not change an MLS’s local mandatory submission deadlines or the Clear Cooperation Policy. MLS participants working with sellers are still required to file a listing with the MLS within one business day from public marketing per CCP. Office exclusive exempt listings also remain an option for sellers.</p><p>Here's how the new MLS policy works. It will allow a seller to instruct their listing agent to delay marketing a home listing through IDX and syndication for a set period of time determined by each local MLS. During the delayed marketing period, the listing is fully available on the MLS to other MLS participants so they can inform their consumers, arrange showings and/or submit offers like other active listings in the MLS. The Delayed Marketing Exempt Listing can also be advertised in any way the seller and their agent see fit. This could include yard signs, posting to a website, or any other of the many strategies to market a property for sale. Sellers who choose to pursue an exempt listing, whether that be a delayed marketing or office exclusive option, will need to sign a disclosure saying they are aware of their options and are making an informed decision about waiving the benefits of immediate public marketing through IDX and syndication.</p><p>With this new policy, agents who participate in the MLS and their buyers will continue to have access to new properties in a timely manner in support of fair housing and healthy competition in the market. At the same time, it allows for more choices and options for sellers. The new policy is effective as of March 25, (2025) and must be locally implemented by Sept. 30, 2025, giving MLSs time to make necessary policy and technology changes. We encourage MLSs to consult with brokers and stakeholders in their market to help determine the allowed time period for delayed marketing exempt listings that will work best for members and consumers in their respective marketplaces.</p><p>I am grateful for the support, engagement and passion that the NAR membership showed throughout this process and I am pleased that we found a solution that reflects the best and balanced interests of consumers, our members and the industry. For more details on this policy, please visit facts.realtor where you can find FAQs, a consumer guide to exempt listings and other resources. Thank you.”</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: The National Association of Realtors announced the new MLs policy on March 25.

    <description><![CDATA[In the first quarter, the Northeast performed best in both sales and price gains by percentage.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—More than 80% of metro markets (189 out of 228, or 83%) registered home price gains in the first quarter of 2025, as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate ranged from 6.63% to 7.04%, according to the National Association of Realtors latest quarterly report released earlier today (May 8). Eleven percent of the 228 tracked metro areas recorded double-digit price gains over the same period, down from 14% in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><blockquote>“Most metro markets continue to set new record highs for home prices,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “In the first quarter, the Northeast performed best in both sales and price gains by percentage. Despite the stronger job additions, the South lagged with declining sales and virtually no price appreciation.”</blockquote><p>Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price grew 3.4% to $402,300. In the prior quarter, the year-over-year national median price increased 4.8%.</p><p>Among the major U.S. regions, the South registered the largest share of existing-home sales (44.9%) in the first quarter, with year-over-year price appreciation of 1.3%. Prices also increased 10.3% in the Northeast, 5.2% in the Midwest and 4.1% in the West.</p><p>The top 10 large markets (where large markets are defined as the 150 most populous areas) with the biggest year-over-year median price increases by percentage all experienced gains of at least 10%. A total of six markets were in New York and Ohio. Overall, those top 10 large markets were Syracuse, NY(17.9%); Montgomery, AL (16.1%); Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA.(13.6%); Nassau County-Suffolk County, NY (12.0%); Toledo, OH(11.1%); Cleveland-Elyria, OH(11.1%); Rochester, NY (11.1%); Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula, MS (10.5%); Trenton, NJ (10.4%); and Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ (10.2%).</p><p>Eight of the top 10 most expensive markets in the U.S. were in California. Those markets were San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($2,020,000; 9.8%); Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,450,000; 6.2%); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,320,000; 1.5%); Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,165,100; 7.3%); San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($1,036,500; 5.7%); Salinas, CA ($954,700; 6.2%); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($953,400; 4.8%); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA. ($931,500; 2.5%); Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL ($865,000; 1.8%); and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($862,600; 4.8%).</p><p>“Very expensive home prices partly reflect multiple years of home underproduction in those metro markets,” Yun added. “Another factor is the low homeownership rates in these areas, implying more unequal wealth distribution. Affordable markets tend to have more adequate supply and higher homeownership rates.”</p><p>Nearly 17% of markets (38 of 228) posted home price declines in the first quarter, up from 11% in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>“A few areas where home prices declined a year or two ago are now rebounding, including Boise, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Seattle,” Yun said. “Similarly, some markets currently experiencing price declines—but with solid job growth—could see prices recover in the near future, such as Austin, San Antonio, Huntsville, Myrtle Beach, Raleigh and many Florida markets.”</p><p>Housing affordability slightly improved in the first quarter. The monthly mortgage payment on a typical existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,120, down only $2 from the fourth quarter of 2024 ($2,122) but up 4.1%—or $84—from one year ago. Families typically spent 24.4% of their income on mortgage payments, down from 24.8% in the prior quarter and 24.5% one year ago.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/2025-q1-metro-home-prices-infographic-05-08-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/2025-q1-metro-home-prices-infographic-05-08-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/2025-q1-metro-home-prices-infographic-05-08-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/2025-q1-metro-home-prices-infographic-05-08-2025-1000w-1500h-2.webp 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>First-time buyers found marginally better affordability circumstances compared to the previous quarter. For a typical starter home valued at $342,000 with a 10% down payment loan, the monthly mortgage payment declined to $2,079, down just $2 from the prior quarter ($2,081). That was an increase of $82, or 4.1%, from one year ago ($1,997). First-time buyers typically spent 36.8% of their family income on mortgage payments, down from 37.4% in the previous quarter.</p><p>A family needed a qualifying income of at least $100,000 to afford a 10% down-payment mortgage in 45.1% of markets, up from 43.8% in the prior quarter. Yet, a family needed a qualifying income of less than $50,000 to afford a home in 3.1% of markets, up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[This draft language preserves or strengthens a raft of provisions vital to housing affordability.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors reported that Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee released the full draft text of their portion of tax reform legislation on May 12—delivering significant wins for the real estate sector and reinforcing provisions long championed by NAR.</p><p>NAR’s advocacy team successfully secured its top five tax priorities in the draft bill, including an enhanced small business tax deduction, a strengthened state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and protections for the mortgage interest deduction (MID). The bill also makes the current lower individual tax rates permanent and increases the child tax credit, moves that could help increase homeownership access for more American families.</p><blockquote>"This is a very strong opening bid for our advocacy priorities. This draft language preserves or strengthens a raft of provisions vital to housing affordability, including making the current lower income tax brackets permanent,” says NAR Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer Shannon McGahn. “These are all measures we have worked tirelessly to advocate for on behalf of our members.”</blockquote><p>“The bill also triples current SALT deduction limits, although it is very possible the SALT deduction could become even more favorable during the amendment process. A national poll commissioned by NAR in April showed that 61% of voters support increasing or eliminating SALT caps, and 74% say double taxation fairness is a compelling reason to do so,” McGahn continued.</p><p>A partial draft of the legislation was released Friday night. The latest details come 24 hours before the committee is scheduled to begin the formal mark-up process today.</p><p>"While the early details are overwhelmingly positive for the real estate economy and small businesses, I would caution that this is just the first draft. The bill will continue to evolve as it moves through the committee process and eventual passage in the House and Senate, with many amendment votes to come,” McGahn said. “We will continue to engage directly with congressional leadership, key committees, and other policymakers to ensure that housing affordability and support for small businesses remain top priorities in these negotiations.:</p><p>He continued, “At a time when we face a historic shortage in housing supply, it is essential that this legislation does not worsen the affordability crisis. With real estate accounting for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. economy, a strong real estate sector is vital to the health of the broader economy.”</p><p>Below is a summary of the draft provisions released today:</p><h3 id="top-five-nar-tax-priorities">Top Five NAR Tax Priorities</h3><p><strong>1. Qualified Business Income Deduction (Section 199A)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft bill retains, makes permanent, and increases the QBI deduction from 20% to 23%.</li>
<li>This deduction benefits more than 90% of NAR members, who are classified as independent contractors or small business owners.</li>
<li>83% of voters support the 20% tax deduction for independent contractors and small businesses making less than $400,000 a year, according to NAR’s recent national poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SALT deduction cap is tripled from $10,000 to $30,000 for households earning under $400,000. However, the bill does not eliminate the current-law marriage penalty. Thus, single filers and married couples filing a joint return both can deduct a maximum of $30,000 in state and local taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Individual Tax Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The current lower individual tax rates are made permanent and indexed for inflation, aiding taxpayers and improving affordability for prospective homebuyers.</li>
<li>86% of voters support the lowered income tax rates for individuals and married couples, according to NAR’s recent national poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft preserves and makes permanent the MID at its current level, maintaining a key tax benefit for homeowners and supporting housing market stability.</li>
<li>There had been concern MID might be reduced or eliminated as a budget offset.</li>
<li>91% of voters support maintaining tax incentives such as the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners, according to NAR’s recent national poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Business SALT and 1031 Like-Kind Exchanges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft bill protects Section 1031 like-kind exchanges, which are often erroneously regarded as a tax loophole.</li>
<li>It also includes no changes for most businesses deducting state and local taxes (sometimes referred to as “Business SALT").</li>
<li>While the bill does provide limits in state-level business SALT workarounds for certain high-income professionals (e.g., law firms, hedge funds, consulting businesses, and other services), the provisions do not appear to impact real estate professionals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-positive-tax-provisions-for-real-estate-economy">Additional Positive Tax Provisions for Real Estate Economy<br></h3><p>• <strong>Child Tax Credit Increased to $2,500 (2025–2028)</strong></p><p>Temporarily raises the child tax credit through 2028 and then indexes it for inflation starting in 2029. The child tax credit supports families and could help with housing affordability.</p><p><strong>• Permanent Estate and Gift Tax Threshold Set at $15 Million (Inflation-Adjusted)</strong></p><p>Prevents a significant drop in exemption levels and supports generational wealth transfer, aligning with NAR priorities.</p><p><strong>• No Top Tax-Rate Increase</strong></p><p>The proposed 39.6% top rate was removed from the bill.</p><p><strong>• Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)</strong></p><p>Key provisions from the LIHTC Improvement Act will be included to support affordable housing development.</p><p><strong>• Restoration of ‘Big 3’ Business Tax Provisions</strong></p><p>Full expensing of research and development (R&amp;D).</p><p>Bonus depreciation.</p><p>Fixes to interest expense deduction limits.</p><p><strong>• Immediate Expensing for Certain Industrial Structures</strong></p><p>Applies to structures used in manufacturing, refining, agriculture and related industries.</p><p><strong>• No Change to Carried Interest Treatment</strong></p><p><strong>• Opportunity Zones</strong></p><p>Renewed with revised incentives to encourage targeted investment, including in rural areas.</p><p>80% of voters expressed support for tax incentives for investors to encourage economic growth and development in underserved and poorer communities, according to NAR’s recent national poll.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Chief among the reform measures included in the budget was disincentivizing institutional investors from buying up one- and two-family homes.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—On May 9, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed new legislation as part of the FY26 Enacted Budget that will make owning and renting a home more affordable by providing more than $1.5 billion in new state funding for housing statewide.</p><p>The funding includes investing $100 million for pro-housing communities to fund critical infrastructure projects to support housing development, $100 million to promote mixed-income housing development, $50 million for the first year of the Housing Access Voucher Program to address households that are homelessness or at risk of imminent homelessness, and $50 million for building more affordable starter homes, among other housing initiatives.</p><blockquote>“New Yorkers deserve a fair chance at achieving the American dream, whether it is buying their first home or renting their first apartment, and this bold plan does just that,” Gov. Hochul said. “As part of my FY 2026 Enacted Budget, I secured over $500 million in capital for housing to uplift local economies and level the playing field so families can have more access to safe and affordable homes.”</blockquote><h3 id="disincentive-institutional-investors-from-buying-singleand-two-family-homes">Disincentive Institutional Investors from<br>Buying Single- and Two-Family Homes</h3><p>Chief among the reform measures included in the budget was disincentivizing institutional investors from buying up one- and two-family homes. Nationally, private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes. According to some estimates, private equity firms are expected to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. To help level the playing field and increase the opportunities for everyday individuals and families to purchase a home, Gov. Hochul signed legislation to disincentivize large investment entities who own 10+ single- and two-family homes and act as a fiduciary for at least $30 million in assets under management from buying single- and two-family homes en masse, and will require a 90-day waiting period for institutional investors to make an offer on one- or two-family homes.</p><p>The prohibition would also apply to an entity that receives funding from a covered institutional investor, other than in the form of a standard mortgage. Nonprofits, land banks, community land trusts, and foreclosure sales would be exempted. With the New York State Attorney General’s enforcement, covered entities that violate the waiting period would be subject to $250,000 penalties, and to $10,000 penalties for failing to provide required notices.</p><p>Additionally, Gov. Hochul signed legislation to prohibit institutional investors from claiming depreciation tax deductions for single- and two-family homes, or claiming interest deductions with respect to such homes, to disincentivize their accumulation of single- and two-family homes. The legislation also requires the New York Department of State (DOS) to provide notice when establishing a “cease and desist zone” in which homeowners who opt into coverage are prohibited from being solicited to sell their homes. The notice requirements will require information about the zone to be posted on the DOS’ website when a zone is established and annually included in a local newspaper within the area of the zone.</p><h3 id="strengthen-laws-to-combat-home-appraisal-discrimination">Strengthen Laws to Combat Home Appraisal Discrimination</h3><p>For many New Yorkers, their largest investment and most valuable asset is their home. Homes provide families with a safe place to live and an opportunity to build generational wealth. For too long, pervasive appraisal bias throughout the housing industry has unjustly stripped families of color of this opportunity, widening racial homeownership and wealth gaps. Gov. Hochul secured agreement on legislation that will make it a violation of the State's Human Rights Law to discriminate when providing real estate appraisals or in making such services available. The law will further enable DOS to fine appraisers for violations, in addition to other existing remedies, with half of those fines going to a fund to support fair housing enforcement. Additionally, the budget includes $4 million in new state support for fair housing testing.</p><h3 id="starter-home-innovation-funding">Starter Home Innovation Funding</h3><p>Governor Hochul’s budget includes $50 million in capital funding to incentivize the building of more starter homes, including innovative approaches to homebuilding such as the use of factory-built and modular development.</p><h3 id="40-million-to-support-the-homeowner-protection-program">$40 Million to Support the Homeowner Protection Program</h3><p>The Homeowner Protection Program is a state-wide network of housing counseling and legal services organizations serving every county in New York. The network provides critical services to at-risk homeowners struggling to maintain their housing and avoid foreclosure. HOPP is also a front-line defense in gentrifying neighborhoods helping to prevent fraud and deed theft for vulnerable homeowners. This $40 million in funding will ensure that this network can continue to serve thousands of homeowners, preserving millions of dollars in equity and stabilizing communities.</p><h3 id="expand-and-strengthen-the-resilient-and-ready-programs">Expand and Strengthen the Resilient and Ready Programs</h3><p>Severe weather events are leaving New York homeowners in need of urgent repairs and long-term resilience measures. The budget includes $50 million in new funding for the Rapid Response Home Repair Program and Resilient Retrofits Program, which have provided vital assistance, helping over 1,300 homeowners to date recover and prepare for future disasters.</p><h3 id="affordable-homebuyer-tax-incentive">Affordable Homebuyer Tax Incentive</h3><p>Even when homes are developed for the express purpose of being sold to low- and moderate-income homebuyers, local property tax assessments value the homes at fair market value, presenting challenges to creating homes these homebuyers can afford to purchase. The Governor has secured agreement for an affordable homebuyer property tax incentive at local opt-in for homes built with assistance from governmental entities, nonprofits, land banks, or community land trusts, and sold to low- and moderate-income homebuyers. This will aid such homebuyers by making their dream of homeownership more attainable by bringing down costs and increasing the supply of these homes.</p><h3 id="100-million-new-york-state-pro-housing-supply-fund">$100 Million New York State Pro-Housing Supply Fund</h3><p>Gov. Hochul signed Executive Order 30 in July 2023 creating the Pro-Housing Communities Program, which recognizes and rewards municipalities actively working to unlock their housing potential and encourages others to follow suit. In the State Fiscal Year 2025 Enacted Budget, Governor Hochul made the “Pro-Housing Community” designation a requirement for accessing up to $650 million in State discretionary programs. So far, 300 localities have been certified, with more than 420 submitting letters of intent from all corners of New York State. To further support localities that are doing their part to address the housing crisis, Governor Hochul is creating a $100 million Pro-Housing Supply fund for certified Pro-Housing Communities to assist with critical infrastructure projects necessary to create new housing, such as sewer and water infrastructure upgrades.</p><h3 id="provide-communities-technical-assistance-to-become-pro-housing">Provide Communities Technical Assistance to Become Pro-Housing</h3><p>To help ensure more localities that want to promote housing growth have the ability to do so, the budget will provide $5.25 million in new grant funding to offer technical assistance to communities seeking to foster housing growth and associated municipal development.</p><h3 id="1-billion-in-state-funding-for-nyc-to-secure-%E2%80%98city-of-yes%E2%80%99">$1 Billion in State Funding for NYC to Secure ‘City of Yes’</h3><p>As New York City confronts a generational housing crisis with a 1.4% rental vacancy rate, the citywide rezoning will enable the creation of 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years and invest $5 billion. As part of the FY26 Enacted Budget, the state is investing $1 billion towards the development and preservation of affordable housing throughout New York City.</p><h3 id="launch-state%E2%80%99s-first-mixed-income-revolving-loan-fund">Launch State’s First Mixed-Income Revolving Loan Fund</h3><p>With major forthcoming economic investments in Upstate New York, such as Micron’s $100 billion investment in Clay, the state continues to need an all-of-the-above approach to the housing supply to address acute housing needs and accommodate job growth. Too often, however, communities do not have the tools to create mixed-income rental housing, leaving many developments permit-ready but unable to secure financing. To bridge this gap and unlock more housing, the budget includes the state’s first revolving loan fund to spur mixed-income rental development. With a $100 million state investment for upstate and New York City, the fund will fill construction financing gaps by providing a lower-cost and more flexible form of capital than is generally available in market financing. The funding will revolve and self-sustain over time through repayments once projects have converted to permanent financing after construction.</p><h3 id="double-new-york-state-low-income-housing-credits">Double New York State Low-Income Housing Credits</h3><p>Modeled after the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, the New York State Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (SLIHC) was signed into law in 2000 and has been critical to supporting the development of housing for low- and middle-income households. The budget will build on this success by proposing to double the amount of the tax credits available through the SLIHC program, making it the largest state low-income housing tax credit program in America. This action alone will generate upwards of $210 million in private investment in affordable housing per year.</p><h3 id="unlock-historic-tax-credits-by-decoupling-expanding-eligibility">Unlock Historic Tax Credits by Decoupling, Expanding Eligibility</h3><p>Currently, New York State law requires Federal and State Historic Tax credits to be coupled together to the same investor and be available only in certain census tracts. These factors depress the economic value of both tax credits and needlessly turn investment away from housing projects, a problem felt especially acutely in upstate New York communities. The budget agreement will unlock the maximum value of the tax credits and eliminate the census tract eligibility requirement.</p><h3 id="fund-the-redevelopment-of-vacant-properties-into-housing">Fund the Redevelopment of Vacant Properties into Housing</h3><p>Many municipalities struggle to acquire and redevelop vacant and abandoned buildings. Many of these properties are in a significant state of disrepair due to years of neglect and are located in neighborhoods that lack the local economic conditions necessary to incentivize redevelopment by the private sector. Consequently, the investment required to redevelop these properties can exceed their value and the resulting funding gap prevents the property from being rehabilitated. Gov. Hochul will better equip communities to fight back against blight while creating more affordable housing opportunities, by securing agreement to authorize localities across the state to adopt a tax exemption to incentivize redevelopment of these properties into affordable homes. The budget also includes $50 million in total funding for Land Banks and $30 million for infill development.</p><h3 id="housing-access-voucher-pilot-program">Housing Access Voucher Pilot Program</h3><p>As part of the FY26 Enacted Budget, the state is investing $50 million for the first year of a four-year pilot program for state-funded vouchers for homeless families or families at imminent risk of losing their housing. Vouchers would be available to households making 50% of area median income. HCR will administer the program through local partners outside of New York City, with the NYC Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and/or the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) administering the program within New York City. The vouchers will be a critical new tool to help New Yorkers escape or evade homelessness and housing insecurity.</p><h3 id="reduce-shelter-rent-taxes-for-mitchell-lama-residents">Reduce Shelter Rent Taxes for Mitchell-Lama Residents</h3><p>Mitchell-Lama Program supports 105,000 units of housing that are affordable to low- and middle-income families. Currently, Mitchell-Lama developments can receive a shelter rent tax abatement to reduce their share of local property taxes. However, the current tax abatement is often insufficient to address escalating increases in insurance, utility, and taxes that endanger building quality and the financial health of this critical supply of affordable housing. To provide much-needed relief, the budget agreement includes legislation that will reduce Mitchell-Lama shelter rent taxes by at least half in New York City and allow for the same by local opt-in in the rest of the state.</p><h3 id="preserving-public-housing-statewide">Preserving Public Housing Statewide</h3><p>As part of the budget, the budget includes $225 million to fund capital improvements for the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), including $25 million for vacant NYCHA units, and $75 million for public housing authorities outside New York City, providing vital support to this essential housing stock and critical quality of life improvements for the residents who call it home.</p><h3 id="expand-capital-to-maintain-improve-supportive-housing">Expand Capital to Maintain, Improve Supportive Housing</h3><p>The Homeless Housing and Assistance Program (HHAP) was among the first programs in the country more than four decades ago to dedicate significant capital resources to creating housing, including permanent affordable and supportive housing, specifically for homeless individuals. Tens of thousands of units have been built since its inception, and today, requests for funding exceed what is available. To meet the growing demand for supportive housing and maintain existing units that provide a safe place to live for many of the most housing-insecure and vulnerable New Yorkers, the budget has secured an increase in funding for HHAP.</p><p>The budget also includes increased funding for supportive housing, extends security deposit protections for rent-regulated tenants and<br>would allow for certain large 100+ unit rental buildings in New York City that currently include affordable units to partially convert to condominiums in order to preserve its expiring affordable units as permanently affordable or increase the amount of existing permanently affordable units in a building. The conversions would be subject to approval by HCR or NYC HPD and have ongoing regulatory oversight over the affordable units, which would be owned by separate nonprofits. The New York State Attorney General's office would further have an oversight role in approving the conversions. The affordable units could subsequently convert to affordable homeownership units, as well.</p><p>The enacted budget will also provide assistance to nonprofit affordable housing owners to undertake repairs and other steps needed to be eligible for such captives.</p><h3 id="additional-capital-investments">Additional Capital Investments</h3><p>In addition to advancing these critical policy actions, the FY 2026 Budget includes more than $1.525 billion in new capital funding to support housing statewide, including but not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>$225 million for capital improvements of New York City Housing Authority developments.</li>
<li>$110 million for capital improvements for Mitchell-Lamas.</li>
<li>$75 million for capital improvements of public housing authorities outside of New York City.</li>
<li>$100 million for mixed-income revolving loan funds; $50 million for upstate and $50 million for New York City.</li>
<li>$40 million for Land Banks to redevelop vacant or abandoned properties.</li>
<li>$40 million for capital awards to upgrade vacant rental units outside of New York City.</li>
<li>$30 million for Infill Housing to fund development of small homes within unused and underutilized lands with existing development patterns.</li>
<li>$20 million to preserve distressed affordable housing in New York City.</li>
<li>$10 million for capital improvements of rural housing subsidized by the Federal USDA 515 program.</li>
<li>$10 million for small multifamily rental developments (SRDI).</li>

    <description><![CDATA[Despite being home to millions and some of the strongest local economies, Los Angeles, CA; Oxnard, CA; San Diego, CA; New York, NY and Spokane, WA are among the furthest from housing-supply balance.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—U.S. households earning $75,000 a year can only afford 21.2% of home listings as of March 2025—up slightly from 20.8% a year prior and representing the biggest gain of any income group—demonstrating that the nation's housing affordability gap persists, according to the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com 2025 Housing Affordability &amp; Supply report.</p><p>The report analyzes the shortage of affordable homes across different income levels in the current U.S. housing market. It provides a real-time, income-specific snapshot of housing affordability, examining what home buyers at various income levels can afford based on standard lending criteria.</p><p>For-sale housing inventory increased nearly 20% nationwide in March 2025 from one year earlier, and while this gain marks progress, it remains far from pre-pandemic conditions.</p><blockquote>“The housing market is at a turning point,” said Nadia Evangelou, NAR senior economist and director of real estate research. “More homes are hitting the market, and it's encouraging to see the greatest housing-supply gains among middle-income home buyers.”</blockquote><p>While households earning $75,000 a year experienced a slight improvement in accessibility to home listings between March 2025 (21.2%) and March 2024 (20.8%), the largest gain of any income group, they have less than half of the access to affordable homes than they had before the pandemic, when nearly 49% of listings were accessible. In a balanced housing market—where listings are aligned with what households at various income levels can afford—these home buyers would need access to 48.1% of listings. To reach that threshold, the market needs nearly 416,000 more listings priced at or below $255,000.</p><p>Households that earn $100,000 annually are in a similar situation. They can currently afford 37.1% of home listings, up slightly from 36.9% in March 2024. That is far below the 64.7% they could afford in 2019 and well below the 60.7% target for market balance. This group faces a shortage of nearly 364,000 home listings priced under $340,000.</p><p>A household earning $50,000 annually can only afford 8.7% of home listings today, down from 9.4% one year ago. These low-income households represent one-in-three households, and in a balanced housing market, they should be able to afford to buy one-in-three listings. For balance, about 367,000 listings at a maximum price of $170,000 are vital.</p><p>Meanwhile, higher-income households have near-total access to the housing market. Home buyers earning $250,000 or more can afford at least 80% of home listings.</p><p>“Shoppers see more homes for sale today than one year ago, and encouragingly, many of these homes have been added at moderate income price points,” said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com chief economist. “But as this report shows, we still don't have an abundance of homes that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households, and the progress that we've seen is not happening everywhere. It's been concentrated in the Midwest and the South.”</p><p>As of March 2025, 30% of the 100 largest metropolitan areas are classified as “Areas Getting Closer to Balance,” where the availability of affordable homes improved significantly over the past year and is relatively strong across income levels. Substantial progress has been made in markets that were previously considered unaffordable, with the affordable home listings improving by more than 5% within the past year. These areas now have housing affordability gaps that are less than 10 percentage points below a balanced housing market.</p><p>Akron, OH; St. Louis, MO; Youngstown, OH; and Pittsburgh, PA exhibit housing conditions that closely align with healthy supply benchmarks. While they are not yet fully balanced, Raleigh, NC; Des Moines, IO; Grand Rapids, MI; Columbia, SC; and Columbus, OH made substantial progress increasing the availability of affordable homes.</p><p>“For many first-time home buyers, navigating the current housing market still feels like window shopping,” added Evangelou. “Listing prices don't match first-time home buyers' budgets. If the promising trend of building smaller homes continues, that could be a meaningful step toward easing the housing affordability gap for more buyers.”</p><p>A sizable slice (44%) of the 100-largest metropolitan areas is classified as “Areas Stuck in the Middle,” where housing supply and demand are misaligned but not at crisis levels. Some markets made small-but-meaningful gains in one year—adding a modest number of affordable listings—but gains have not been substantial enough to shift the market.</p><p>Seattle, WA and Washington, D.C. experienced moderate increases in the share of homes considered affordable over the past year, with an average rise of four percentage points. While that marks progress, both cities still face some of the largest affordability gaps in the country, requiring households to earn more than $150,000 a year just to afford half the homes on the market. In contrast, Austin, TX; Salt Lake City, UT and Denver, CO made substantial progress, boosting the share of affordable listings by an average of 20 percentage points. Notably, San Francisco, CA has also seen very significant improvement, with the supply of affordable listings surpassing pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>“Even in high-cost areas like San Francisco, we're witnessing real progress,” explained Evangelou. “While the housing market remains far from balanced, current for-sale home listings better align with home buyers' incomes compared to pre-COVID-19 levels—a clear reminder that improvement is possible."</p><p>Twenty-six percent of the 100 largest metro areas are classified as “Areas Falling Further Behind,” where the gap from a balanced housing market continues to widen, worsening housing affordability. In these metropolitan areas, the availability of affordable listings has either declined over the past year or remains more than 20 percentage points below what is considered a balanced housing market, highlighting a troubling trend in housing accessibility.</p><p>Despite being home to millions and some of the strongest local economies, Los Angeles, CA; Oxnard, CA; San Diego, CA; New York, NY and Spokane, WA are among the furthest from housing-supply balance. Even with improvement since last year, these areas continue to face the most severe shortages of affordable home listings.</p><p>From a state perspective, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and West Virginia lead the nation in offering balanced housing market conditions. In most of these states, a household earning $75,000—close to the national median—can afford more than 45% of the for-sale home listings. Although they are improving with additional inventory and moving in the right direction, Montana, Idaho, California, Massachusetts and Hawaii still need a plentiful supply of affordable home listings. Delaware, Utah, Colorado, Florida and Arizona showed the most improvement with significant year-over-year gains in housing affordability. Only the District of Columbia improved affordability compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The decline in single-family housing starts in April mirrors builder sentiment, as elevated interest rates, uncertainty on the tariff front and rising construction costs are exacerbating housing affordability challenges.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Economic uncertainty stemming from tariff issues, elevated mortgage rates and rising building material costs pushed single-family housing starts lower in April, the National Association of Home Builders reported on May 16.</p><p>Overall housing starts increased 1.6% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.36 million units, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau.</p><p>The April reading of 1.36 million starts is the number of housing units builders would begin if development kept this pace for the next 12 months. Within this overall number, single-family starts decreased 2.1% to a 927,000 seasonally adjusted annual rate and are down 12% compared to April 2024. The multifamily sector, which includes apartment buildings and condos, increased 10.7% to an annualized 434,000 pace.</p><p>“The decline in single-family housing starts in April mirrors builder sentiment, as elevated interest rates, uncertainty on the tariff front and rising construction costs are exacerbating housing affordability challenges,” said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders and a home builder and developer from Lexington, NC. “In turn, this is making it more difficult for builders to deliver entry-level housing at a price point that is accessible to home buyers.”</p><p>“Economic uncertainty, especially around interest rates and inflation, continues to impact both builder financing costs and buyers’ ability to qualify,” said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, NAHB’s assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis. “However, recent developments on the tariff front concerning the United Kingdom and China along with major tax legislation advancing in Congress should provide a boost to housing demand and positive momentum for the economy.”</p><p>On a regional and year-to-date basis, combined single-family and multifamily starts were 19.8% higher in the Northeast, 4.4% higher in the Midwest, 7.4% lower in the South and 3.4% higher in the West.</p><p>Overall permits decreased 4.7% to a 1.41-million-unit annualized rate in April. Single-family permits decreased 5.1% to a 922,000-unit rate and are down 6.2% compared to April 2024. Multifamily permits decreased 3.7% to a 490,000 pace.</p><p>Looking at regional permit data on a year-to-date basis, permits were 20.3% lower in the Northeast, 5.1% higher in the Midwest, 3.8% lower in the South and 3.5% lower in the West.</p><p>In April, the number of single-family homes under construction was at 630,000 homes while the count of apartments under construction was at 788,000 units.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul on May 3, 2023, as part of the 2023-2024 New York State budget bill, Section 1377 of the Public Health Law will take effect on Nov. 3, 2025.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead-based paint remains a significant public health concern, particularly in older residential buildings, due to its severe health risks, especially for young children and pregnant women. Recognizing this, New York State has introduced a new lead paint registry law, Section 1377 of the Public Health Law [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4k8xYPJ">https://bit.ly/4k8xYPJ</a>], aimed at reducing childhood lead poisoning through enhanced oversight and accountability. This article explores the law’s effective date, legal requirements, legislative history, landlord obligations, compliance costs and the duties of licensed real estate agents under or related to this legislation.</p><h3 id="effective-date">Effective Date</h3><p>Signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul on May 3, 2023, as part of the 2023-2024 New York State budget bill, Section 1377 of the Public Health Law will take effect on Nov. 3, 2025. The obligation to conduct inspections begins on May 3, 2026, with the first round of certifications due by Oct. 1, 2026. The delayed implementation allows the New York State Department of Health and the New York State Department of State time to develop necessary regulations and gives property owners a window to prepare for compliance. As of now, draft regulations have not been proposed for public comment, indicating that further guidance is forthcoming.</p><p><strong>Legal Requirements and Legislative History</strong></p><p>Section 1377 establishes a statewide rental registry for residential buildings outside New York City that meet specific criteria: buildings with two or more units, constructed before 1980, located in “communities of concern” as determined by the DOH, and currently rented or potentially eligible for rental. The law mandates that owners of these properties conduct lead-based paint inspections and submit certifications to the DOH, ensuring compliance with lead safety standards. It also integrates with the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, making compliance a condition for issuing certificates of occupancy or compliance following periodic fire safety and property maintenance inspections.</p><p>The legislative history of Section 1377 reflects New York’s ongoing commitment to addressing lead poisoning. Building on decades of efforts, including New York City’s 1960 ban on lead-based paint and the federal ban in 1978, the state has progressively tightened regulations. The 2004 Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act (Local Law 1) in New York City set a precedent for proactive lead hazard management, and Section 1377 extends similar principles statewide, particularly targeting high-risk areas outside urban centers. The law emerged from growing awareness of persistent lead exposure risks in older housing stock, driven by data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and advocacy from initiatives like LeadFreeNYC, launched in 2019.</p><h3 id="landlord-requirements-under-section-1377">Landlord Requirements under Section 1377</h3><p>Landlords of properties covered by Section 1377 face several key obligations:</p><p><strong>Inspection and Testing</strong>—Owners must arrange for lead-based paint inspections by EPA-certified professionals using approved methods, such as X-ray fluorescence (“XRF”) testing, to identify lead hazards. Inspections must be completed by May 3, 2026, for properties in the registry.</p><p><strong>Certification and Reporting</strong>—Landlords must submit certifications to the DOH confirming that inspections have been conducted and any identified lead hazards have been remediated or managed. The first certifications are due by Oct. 1, 2026, with ongoing requirements to maintain compliance.</p><p><strong>Remediation</strong>—If lead-based paint is found, landlords must hire EPA-certified contractors to safely remove, encapsulate, or cover the paint using lead-safe work practices. This may involve wet scraping, repainting, or encasing surfaces to eliminate hazards.</p><p><strong>Recordkeeping</strong>—Owners must maintain detailed records of inspections, remediation efforts, and certifications for at least ten (10) years, similar to requirements under New York City’s Local Law 1.</p><p><strong>Compliance with Building Codes</strong>—The law ties lead paint compliance to the issuance of certificates of occupancy or compliance, meaning failure to meet requirements could delay or prevent legal occupancy of rental units.</p><p>Non-compliance carries significant penalties, including civil fines and potential litigation from tenants affected by lead exposure. Landlords must also remain vigilant about tenant notifications, as tenants have a right to know about lead hazards under federal and state disclosure laws.</p><h3 id="compliance-costs">Compliance Costs</h3><p>Complying with Section 1377 entails several costs for landlords, which can vary depending on the size, age, and condition of the property. Some of the costs landlords will face are as follows:</p><p><strong>Inspection Costs</strong>—XRF testing by EPA-certified inspectors typically ranges from $300 to $1,000 per unit, with larger buildings incurring higher costs due to the number of units and common areas. For a small multi-family building, total inspection costs could easily exceed $5,000.</p><p><strong>Remediation Expenses</strong>—If lead is detected, abatement or encapsulation costs can be substantial. Simple measures like wet scraping and repainting may cost $1,000 to $3,000 per unit, while full abatement, including removal and replacement of surfaces, could range from $10,000 to $30,000, or more for larger areas.</p><p><strong>Administrative and Legal Fees</strong>—Maintaining records, submitting certifications, and consulting with real estate attorneys to ensure compliance may add $500 to $2,000 annually, depending on the complexity of the property portfolio owned by a landlord.</p><p><strong>Potential Fines</strong>—Non-compliance penalties can range from $1,000 to $5,000 per violation, with additional costs if violations lead to litigation or emergency repairs ordered by authorities.</p><p>While these costs may strain smaller landlords, exemptions are available for properties certified as lead-free through XRF testing, potentially reducing long-term expenses. Proactive compliance can also mitigate legal risks and enhance property value by appealing to health-conscious tenants.</p><h3 id="existing-obligations-and-duties-of-licensed-real-estate-agents-relating-to-epa-lead-paint-disclosure">Existing Obligations and Duties of Licensed Real Estate Agents Relating to EPA Lead Paint Disclosure</h3><p>Licensed real estate agents in New York have specific duties related to lead-based paint disclosures, which intersect with the new registry law. While Section 1377 itself does not directly impose obligations on agents, related legislation, such as federal regulations under the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X) [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4kqjkDi">https://bit.ly/4kqjkDi</a>] outline their responsibilities. In October 2024, a new rule was introduced by the EPA which imposed stronger requirements for identifying and cleaning up lead paint dust in pre-1978 homes and childcare facilities [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/4j7j9f0">https://bit.ly/4j7j9f0</a>]. The EPA has also provided an important Fact Sheet [<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/42ZGIBG">https://bit.ly/42ZGIBG</a>] which all real estate professionals should review and provide to their clients.</p><p><em>Disclosure Requirements</em></p><p>Agents must ensure that sellers or landlords of pre-1978 properties provide buyers or tenants with an EPA-approved pamphlet, “Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home,” and disclose any known lead-based paint hazards. This includes providing records of lead inspections or remediation, which may now include certifications from the Section 1377 registry.</p><p><em>Timely Notification</em></p><p>Agents representing buyers must inform them of their rights to conduct lead inspections before signing a contract, typically allowing a 10-day period for such assessments. When representing sellers, agents must ensure buyers are informed if the buyer lacks representation.</p><p><em>Compliance Oversight</em></p><p>Agents must initial the disclosure forms to acknowledge their role in facilitating and acknowledging compliance with the Lead Paint regulations. The EPA has provided updated sample disclosure forms in 2025 [<u>see</u> <em>Sample Seller’s Disclosure of Information</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3EY1Lvj">https://bit.ly/3EY1Lvj</a> and <em>Sample Lessor's Disclosure of Information</em> at <a href="https://bit.ly/43up8pz">https://bit.ly/43up8pz</a>]. Failure to meet these obligations can result in penalties, including fines, and/or license suspension or revocation of the agent’s license by the DOS.</p><h3 id="education-and-awareness-the-role-of-the-real-estate-professional">Education and Awareness: The Role of the Real Estate Professional</h3><p>It is important for owners and real estate professionals to be aware of proposed legislation in New York that could increase the obligations and requirements relating to disclosure of lead-based paint test results in real estate transactions [<u>see</u> <em>Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Act</em> proposed in Senate Bills S2142A at <a href="https://bit.ly/3FbfL4R">https://bit.ly/3FbfL4R</a> and S2353A at <a href="https://bit.ly/4mjfJsj">https://bit.ly/4mjfJsj</a>]. Agents play a critical role in ensuring transparency in real estate transactions, particularly as the registry law increases scrutiny on lead safety. By facilitating proper disclosures and advising clients on compliance, real estate licensees help protect both parties from legal and health risks.</p><p>New York State’s Section 1377 lead paint registry law, effective Nov. 3, 2025, marks a significant step in combating childhood lead poisoning. By mandating inspections, certifications, and remediation for pre-1980 rental properties (in contrast to the pre-1978 date required by the EPA), the law imposes clear responsibilities on landlords while introducing compliance costs that require careful planning. Licensed real estate agents, though not directly regulated by Section 1377, must navigate related disclosure laws to ensure transparency and compliance in property transactions. As the state finalizes regulations, landlords and agents alike must stay informed to meet these new standards, protecting tenants and upholding public health.</p><p><em>Legal Corner author John Dolgetta, Esq, is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Across several counties, April brought a surge of new interest, particularly in the Bronx, Rockland, and Putnam counties]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—After a winter of mixed activity, the Hudson Valley housing market showed fresh signs of life in April, according to the latest report from the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors released on May 22. While closed sales remained inconsistent across the region, a noticeable uptick in pending transactions suggests that buyer confidence may be on the rebound as we head into the summer market.</p><p>Across several counties, April brought a surge of new interest, particularly in the Bronx, Rockland, and Putnam counties. Pending single-family home sales in the Bronx rose more than 36% compared to April 2024, even as closed sales dipped by nearly 39%. Median prices in the borough remained strong, with single-family homes reaching $657,000, up nearly 10% year-over-year.</p><p>Putnam County also stood out with a 44% increase in pending sales and a nearly 37% jump in closed single-family transactions, accompanied by a 6.6% rise in median price to $559,500. Meanwhile, Rockland County saw pending sales climb 23%, even as closed activity fell slightly. Home values there remained steady, with the median single-family price ticking up to $746,000.</p><p>In Westchester, the region’s largest and most competitive market, the story was more nuanced. Closed single-family sales were down 12%, but prices continued their upward trajectory, increasing more than 15% from last April to reach a median of $999,000. Condo prices also grew by more than 15%, reaching $552,000, signaling strong demand despite tight supply.</p><blockquote>“Buyers are adjusting to the new normal of higher interest rates and limited inventory,” said HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez. “We're seeing momentum build, especially in pending sales, which tells us that the desire to own a home in our region remains strong, even if buyers are having to act more strategically.”</blockquote><p>Orange County painted a slightly more cautious picture, with single-family home sales dipping by 2% and median prices declining by nearly 3%. Yet condo activity showed strength, with new listings and pending sales climbing steadily.</p><p>Co-op and condo markets, often smaller and more sensitive to price fluctuations, continued to show mixed results. Co-op prices in Rockland County jumped 28% year-over-year, while co-op sales in the Bronx were down more than 14%. Westchester’s co-op sector saw modest gains in price, but a notable dip in pending transactions.</p><p>Year-to-date comparisons through April tell an important story: while total listings and closed sales may still lag behind last year in some areas, prices are holding firm, and in many cases, rising, thanks to sustained demand. Inventory remains a limiting factor across the region, though counties like Rockland and Putnam have shown some improvement in available supply.</p><p>“Real estate is hyperlocal,” HGAR’s Fernandez added. “What’s true in Westchester might not apply in Sullivan or the Bronx. That’s why our Realtors are such a valuable resource to buyers and sellers navigating this evolving market.”</p><p>Today’s report by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors is based on data supplied by OneKey MLS.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales slowed in April, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales dipped in the Northeast and West, grew in the Midwest and were unchanged in the South. Year-over-year, sales declined in three regions and remained steady in the Northeast.</p><p>Total existing-home sales—completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops—slipped 0.5% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.00 million in April. Year-over-year, sales descended 2.0% (down from 4.08 million in April 2024).</p><p>“Home sales have been at 75% of normal or pre-pandemic activity for the past three years, even with seven million jobs added to the economy,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Pent-up housing demand continues to grow, though not realized. Any meaningful decline in mortgage rates will help release this demand.”</p><p>Total housing inventory registered at the end of April was 1.45 million units, up 9.0% from March and 20.8% from one year ago (1.2 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 4.4-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 4.0 months in March and 3.5 months in April 2024.</p><p>The median existing-home price for all housing types in April was $414,000, up 1.8% from one year ago ($406,600). The Northeast and Midwest posted price increases, and the South and West registered price decreases.</p><p>“At the macro level, we are still in a mild seller’s market,” Yun said. “But with the highest inventory levels in nearly five years, consumers are in a better situation to negotiate for better deals.”</p><p><strong>Realtors Confidence Index</strong></p><p>According to the monthly Realtors Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 29 days in April, down from 36 days in March but up from 26 days in April 2024.</p><p>First-time home buyers were responsible for 34% of sales in April, up from 32% in March and 33% in April 2024. NAR’s 2024 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers—released November 2024—found that the annual share of first-time home buyers was 24%, the lowest ever recorded.</p><p>Cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions in April, down from 26% in March and 28% in April 2024.</p><p>Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 15% of homes in April, identical to March and down from 16% in April 2024.</p><p>Distressed sales—foreclosures and short sales—represented 2% of sales in April, down from 3% in March and unchanged from the previous year.</p><p><strong>Mortgage Rates</strong></p><p>According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.81% as of May 15. That’s up from 6.76% one week before, but down from 7.02% one year ago.</p><p><strong>Single-Family and Condo/Co-op Sales</strong></p><p>Single-family home sales waned 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million in April, down 1.4% from the prior year. The median existing single-family home price was $418,000 in April, up 1.7% from April 2024.</p><p>Existing condominium and co-op sales faded 2.6% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 370,000 units, down 7.5% from one year ago.

    <description><![CDATA[The SALT deduction cap is quadrupled from $10,000 to $40,000 for households earning under $500,000.  However, the bill does not eliminate the marriage penalty. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives early this morning passed the controversial “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by a slim 215-214 margin that delivers significant wins for the real estate sector, reinforcing tax provisions long championed by the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>NAR’s advocacy team successfully secured its top five tax priorities in the bill, including an enhanced small business tax deduction, a strengthened state and local tax deduction, and protections for the mortgage interest deduction. The bill also makes the current lower individual tax rates permanent and increases the child tax credit, moves that could help increase homeownership access for more American families.</p><p>In addition to NAR’s top tax priorities, the bill includes a broad range of other Realtor-supported provisions—such as enhancements to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, estate tax certainty, renewed Opportunity Zone incentives, and the creation of tax-advantaged child investment accounts that can be used for qualified expenses of the beneficiary such as first-time home purchases—all of which strengthen housing affordability, investment, and generational wealth.</p><blockquote>“We appreciate House leaders for taking this important step with a bill that supports hardworking families and strengthens the real estate economy. With lower tax rates, SALT relief, and new incentives for small businesses and community development, this proposal brings real benefits to everyday Americans,” says Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer.</blockquote><p>“While significant changes are possible as this bill moves to the Senate, NAR will stay closely engaged with lawmakers to ensure real estate remains a central focus,” McGahn said. “We are committed to advocating for provisions that expand opportunity, support homeownership, strengthen communities nationwide, and put the American Dream within reach for more families.”</p><p>In a recent national survey commissioned by NAR, Americans expressed strong support for retaining provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act critical to the real estate economy and homeownership. Fully 76% of voters are aware of efforts to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among those familiar with the law, support grows significantly when specific provisions are highlighted—86% back lower income tax rates for individuals and married couples, 83% support a new 20% deduction for independent contractors and small businesses earning under $400,000, and 80% favor tax incentives aimed at spurring investment in underserved communities.</p><p>The national survey of 1,000 registered voters was commissioned by NAR and conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Hart Research from April 3–6, 2025. It has a margin of error of 3.10%.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions included in the current bill:</p><h3 id="top-five-nar-tax-priorities">Top Five NAR Tax Priorities<br></h3><p><strong>1. Qualified Business Income Deduction (Section 199A)</strong></p><ul>
<li>The bill permanently increases the QBI deduction from 20% to 23%.</li>
<li>This deduction benefits more than 90% of NAR members, who are classified as independent contractors or small business owners.</li>
<li>83% of voters said they supported the 20% tax deduction for independent contractors and small businesses making less than $400,000 a year, according to NAR’s national poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT)</strong></p><ul>
<li>The SALT deduction cap is quadrupled from $10,000 to $40,000 for households earning under $500,000.  However, the bill does not eliminate the marriage penalty. Thus, whether taxpayers are single filers or married couples filing a joint return, they can deduct a maximum of $40,000 in state and local taxes. The income cap and deduction both grow 1% every year over a 10-year window.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Individual Tax Rates</strong></p><ul>
<li>Current individual tax rates, lowered as part of the TCJA, are made permanent and indexed for inflation, aiding taxpayers and improving affordability for prospective homebuyers.</li>
<li>86% of voters support the lowered income tax rates for individuals and married couples, according to NAR’s national poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID)</strong></p><ul>
<li>The draft preserves and makes permanent the MID at its current level, maintaining a key tax benefit for homeowners and supporting housing market stability.</li>
<li>There had been concern MID might be reduced or eliminated as a budget offset.</li>
<li>91% of voters support maintaining tax incentives such as the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners, according to the NAR poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Business SALT and 1031 Like-Kind Exchanges</strong></p><ul>
<li>The draft bill protects Section 1031 like-kind exchanges, which are often erroneously regarded as a tax loophole.</li>
<li>It also includes no changes for most businesses deducting state and local taxes (sometimes referred to as “Business SALT”).</li>
<li>While the bill does provide limits in state-level business SALT workarounds for certain high-income professionals (e.g., law firms, hedge funds, consulting businesses, and other services), the provisions do not appear to impact real estate professionals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-positive-tax-provisions-for-the-real-estate-economy">Additional Positive Tax Provisions for the Real Estate Economy<br></h3><p><strong>Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)</strong></p><ul>
<li>Key provisions from the LIHTC Improvement Act will be included to support affordable housing development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Child Tax Credit Increased to $2,500 (2025–2028)</strong></p><ul>
<li>Temporarily raises the child tax credit through 2028 and then indexes it for inflation starting in 2029.</li>
<li>The child tax credit supports families and could help with housing affordability.</li>
<li>Creation of Tax-Advantaged Child Investment Accounts</li>
<li>Can be used for qualified expenses of the beneficiary such as first-time home purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permanent Estate and Gift Tax Threshold Set at $15 Million (Inflation-Adjusted)</strong></p><ul>
<li>Prevents a significant drop in exemption levels and supports generational wealth transfer, aligning with NAR priorities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No Top Tax-Rate Increase</strong></p><ul>
<li>The proposed 39.6% top rate was removed from the bill.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Restoration of “Big 3” Business Tax Provisions</strong></p><ul>
<li>Full expensing of research and development (R&amp;D)</li>
<li>Bonus depreciation</li>
<li>Fixes to interest expense deduction limits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Immediate Expensing for Certain Industrial Structures</strong></p><ul>
<li>Applies to structures used in manufacturing, refining, agriculture and related industries.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[The report warns that if Westchester fails to address its growing housing shortfall, the county could lose between 8,400 to 12,000 jobs annually and $533 million to $742 million in annual earnings.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—A newly released report by the Westchester County Association and the Regional Plan Association estimates that the county currently has a large housing shortfall and faces severe economic fallout if it does not address the issue in future years in the form of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars in gross revenues lost.</p><p>The findings of the “Building Growth: The Economic Impact of Addressing Westchester’s Housing Crisis” were originally released at the Westchester County Association’s Real Estate Summit held on May 21 at the Westchester County Club in Rye.</p><p>The report warns that if Westchester fails to address its growing housing shortfall, the county could lose between 8,400 to 12,000 jobs annually and $533 million to $742 million in annual earnings. The price tag would total between $32 billion and approximately $57 billion in Gross Domestic Product by 2040.</p><p>Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said, “Westchester County understands that there is a real, critical need for more housing opportunities if we want to move in tandem with the development that has been occurring across the economic sector. Since our administration first took office, we have made it abundantly clear that housing—and the availability of all kinds of housing options—would remain a top priority. Our recent investments in housing align with our long-term strategy to address housing needs, and provide stability for families who are looking to build their futures here. I want to thank our partners at the Westchester County Association and the Regional Plan Association for compiling this important study, that clearly demonstrates the conversations that must be had to continue moving Westchester forward.”</p><blockquote>Michael N. Romita, president and CEO of the Westchester County Association, said, “This report confirms what we’ve been sounding the alarm about: housing isn’t just a social issue—it’s an economic one. With support from our county government over the past few years, Westchester has made great progress on housing over the past several years. If we want Westchester to remain competitive, if we want to support our workforce and fuel the incredible momentum we’re seeing in sectors like healthcare, we must prioritize smart, sustainable housing development.”</blockquote><p>Romita noted that if the county and its localities achieve the governor’s Pro-Housing goal of increasing their housing stock by 1% each year, the shortfall, which is now at 21,000, would not be as drastic. Westchester County in November 2019, released its Housing Needs Assessment report that calculated a shortfall of new affordable housing units of 11,703.</p><p>Romita said the report clearly shows the economic benefits of housing development that would make Westchester a desirable location to do business. The lack of progress in filling the housing affordability gap would have the reverse effect on the county’s economy and business climate, he added.</p><p>“If the county continues on its current trajectory, its housing shortfall could grow to between 44,000 to 77,000 units by 2040,” the report stated, “A pro-housing policy of 1% annual growth compounded year-over-year between now and 2040 would substantially reduce this housing shortfall. But it would still leave a gap of approximately 10,400 units, even when assuming a more modest population and job growth scenario.”</p><p>Conversely, if the county fully addresses its housing needs going forward, the economic benefits would be substantial—Westchester County could create up to $82 billion in economic activity, 17,300 annual jobs, and $1.1 billion in earnings power, the report stated.</p><p>The research was authored by RPA’s Director of Land Use Marcel Negret, Vice President of Housing and Neighborhood Planning Moses Gates and Research Intern Husen Kharodawala, and was presented at the WCA event by RPA’s Executive Vice President Kate Slevin.</p><p>“RPA is proud to work with WCA on this new report that defines what the county stands to gain by addressing the housing crisis,” said Slevin. “Our research shows that progress has been made to create more homes in walkable, transit-oriented neighborhoods, but more must be done to address the County’s historically low vacancy rate.”</p><p>According to the report, over the last 30 years, there have been approximately 61,000 residential units, 34,000 during the first development cycle (1990-2009) and 27,000 during the second (2010-2024) in Westchester County.</p><p>Since 2010, there has been a significant shift towards higher-density housing and Transit Oriented Development. Moreover, the share of multifamily buildings (with five units or more) has grown substantially, constituting 78% of the total stock permitted between 2010 and 2024, compared to 29% during the pre-recession cycle.</p><p>However, despite this surge in building activity, it has not kept up with demand. The county’s rental housing vacancy rate has fallen to a historic low of 1.9%. Meanwhile, over the past decade, average rents in the county rose 46% from $2,051 in 2015 to $2,990 in 2025.</p><p>The RPA stated in the report: “Continued development of housing in Westchester is an investment in a robust economy, a local and productive talent pool attractive to businesses, and vibrant communities that enjoy a strengthening tax base. Housing initiatives will contribute to the county’s long-term prosperity. On the other hand, inaction will lead to significantly higher costs than those associated with implementing essential investments and policy modifications that support smart housing growth.”</p><p>The Real Estate Summit also featured a panel of industry leaders driving Westchester’s healthcare real estate expansion that was moderated by Patricia Simone, President of Simone Development Companies. The panel included: Joshua Ratner, EVP and Chief Strategy Officer at WMCHealth; Vaughn Ratchford, SVP and Chief Real Estate Officer at New York Blood Center Enterprises; Joshua Strugatz, Chief Campus Transformation Officer at White Plains Hospital; and Joseph A. Ienuso, Group SVP of Facilities and Real Estate at New York-Presbyterian. The panel explored how healthcare and life sciences institutions are investing in major construction projects—and how the region’s housing ecosystem must evolve to support the healthcare sector’s continued growth.</p><p>To access the full RPA report, go to: <a href="https://rpa.org/work/reports/building-growth">https://rpa.org/work/reports/building-growth</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales declined 6.3% in April, according to data released by the National Association of Realtors on May 29. All four U.S. regions experienced month-over-month losses in transactions. Year-over-year, contract signings rose in the Midwest, but fell in the Northeast, South and West—with the West suffering the greatest loss.</p><p>The Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—dove 6.3% to 71.3 in April. Year-over-year, pending transactions retracted by 2.5%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p><blockquote>“At this critical stage of the housing market, it is all about mortgage rates,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Despite an increase in housing inventory, we are not seeing higher home sales. Lower mortgage rates are essential to bring home buyers back into the housing market.”</blockquote><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/NAR-April-202025-PHS-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/NAR-April-202025-PHS-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/05/NAR-April-202025-PHS-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pending-home-sales-regional-breakdown">Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</h3><p>The Northeast PHSI decreased 0.6% from last month to 62.1, down 3.0% from April 2024. The Midwest index condensed 5.0% to 73.5 in April, up 2.2% from the previous year.</p><p>The South PHSI sank 7.7% to 85.9 in April, down 3.0% from a year ago. The West index degraded 8.9% from the prior month to 53.3, down 6.5% from April 2024.</p><p>“Home buyers have a better chance to purchase homes in affordable regions such as the Midwest, where the typical home price is $313,000—25% below the national median home price,” added Yun. “Moreover, with housing inventory levels reaching five-year highs, home buyers in nearly every region of the country are in a better position to negotiate more favorable terms.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor’s Note: This article first appeared in Realtor Magazine.</em></p><p>WASHINGTON—Will the current tax reform bill—with significant wins for real estate—emerge intact from Senate deliberations?</p><p>Ahead of meetings with their senators and representatives this week, National Association of Realtors members had the opportunity to sit with two former members of Congress—Kevin Brady of Texas and Dan Kildee of Michigan—for a discussion centered on H.R. 1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill,” and its potential impact on the real estate economy.</p><p>Nearly 7,500 NAR members are in Washington, D.C., this week for the Realtors Legislative Meetings and to talk with their members of Congress about Realtors’ legislative priorities. Visits to Capitol Hill are planned for Wednesday.</p><h3 id="prospects-for-senate-passage">Prospects for Senate Passage</h3><p>In its current state, the bill retains the current income tax rates while including a range of NAR-supported provisions, including an increase in the qualified business income deduction and quadrupling of the state and local tax deduction.</p><p>Brady, a former chair of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee, was one of the architects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reshaped the U.S. Tax Code for individuals, businesses and families. At Monday’s Federal Legislative &amp; Political Forum, Brady expressed gratitude for support from the real estate industry and highlighted the aggressive timetable that was needed to pass H.R. 1. He noted that “it is important, on the demand side, to lock in the current rates and not impose a 22% tax hike on middle-class families and small businesses.”</p><p>Kildee, who served on Ways &amp; Means, emphasized the broader scope of the current bill and the thin margins in both houses, noting concerns from the Senate. “In all likelihood, there will be some changes from the House version,” he said. Both men agreed on the importance of maintaining mortgage interest deductibility and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.</p><h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3><p>NAR remains committed to advocating for provisions that expand opportunity, support homeownership, strengthen communities nationwide, and put the American dream within reach for more families.</p><blockquote>“While changes are likely as this bill moves to the Senate, NAR will stay closely engaged with lawmakers to ensure real estate remains a central focus,” says Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. “We are committed to advocating for provisions that expand opportunity, support homeownership, strengthen communities nationwide, and put the American dream within reach for more families.”</blockquote><p><em>About the author: Michael Rauber is manager of advocacy communications at the National Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Part of the delay in recovery is because the Federal Reserve has changed its outlook and appears to be on pause for a longer period.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said existing home sales will increase by 6% in 2025 and by 11% in 2026 during the “Residential Economic Issues &amp; Trends Forum” at the NAR 2025 Realtors Legislative Meetings held on June 3. Yun forecasted that new-home sales will rise by 10% in 2025 and by 5% in 2026, the median home price will climb by 3% in 2025 and by 4% in 2026 and that mortgage rates will average 6.4% in the second half of 2025 and 6.1% in 2026.</p><blockquote>“The housing market remains very difficult at the moment, as you know,” Yun told a ballroom of real estate professionals. “Part of the delay in recovery is because the Federal Reserve has changed its outlook and appears to be on pause for a longer period.”</blockquote><p>In 2024, the Federal Reserve previously forecast that gross domestic product would increase 2.1% and inflation would rise by 2.4%, but it downgraded that forecast in March 2025, lessening its forecast for GDP to rise by only 1.7% and raising its inflation forecast to 2.7%.</p><p>"The fast ascent of mortgage rates has really hurt the real estate market,” Yun added.</p><p>When it comes to the housing market, Yun explained to the audience, “Your past clients are all happy. But for new home buyers, their monthly payment obligation has increased, and this is what’s killing the housing market. Mortgage rates are the magic bullet, and we’re waiting and waiting until those come down.”</p><p>Yun explained that inflation was at 2.3% in April, slightly higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2.0% implicit target, stating, “We’re not there yet, but we’re very close. The Fed will cut interest rates once inflation is fully under control.”</p><p>On inflation, Yun pointed out that shelter cost is the heavyweight.</p><p>“Only the tariffs’ impact is being discussed. What about other forces that are less discussed? There are other forces out there; for example, the shelter component is the biggest weight to the price component. The shelter cost is already coming down from its recent cyclical peak, and it’s trending downward,” he said.</p><p>Yun detailed that the U.S. has experienced better job growth since its pre-pandemic highs in 2020. He also explained that wage growth (3.8%) is outpacing the consumer price index (2.3%).</p><p>Regarding the housing market, Yun stated, “Home sales have been very difficult over the past two years. We’ve had the lowest home sales in 30 years for two consecutive years.”</p><p>“There’s a light at the end of the tunnel based on recent rises in mortgage applications to buy a home,” Yun added optimistically. “Moreover, a solid majority of renters expressed desire to own a home.”</p><p>To view Yun's slide presentation, visit <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/presentations/june-2025-real-estate-and-economic-outlook" rel="noreferrer">June 2025 Real Estate and Economic Outlook</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The board action brings greater clarity to Standard of Practice 10-5, which prohibits members of NAR from harassing any person or persons based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor’s Note: This article first appeared in Realtor Magazine.</em></p><p>WASHINGTON—At its June 5 meeting, The National Association of Realtors Board of Directors approved policy language changes related to Article 10 of the NAR Code of Ethics. Article 10, which prohibits Realtors from denying equal professional services and employment opportunities based on protected characteristics, remains unchanged.</p><p>The board action brings greater clarity to Standard of Practice 10-5, which prohibits members of NAR from harassing any person or persons based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity. New language in the standard creates a specific definition of “harassment” to align with the definition in the NAR Member Code of Conduct.</p><p>One day earlier, NAR’s Executive Committee approved a related change, a revision to Professional Standards Policy Statement 29, which guides local and state associations on application of the Code’s Articles and Standard of Practices. This change focuses enforcement on instances in which Realtors are operating in their capacity as real estate professionals, in association with their real estate businesses, or in real estate-related activities.</p><h3 id="a-living-document">A Living Document</h3><p>Like the English language itself, the NAR Code of Ethics evolves over time. The Professional Standards Committee and its Interpretations Advisory Board recommend changes, as needed, to ensure the articles and standards of practice are clear in their language and intent and can be enforced fairly and consistently. Any recommendations approved by the committee are reviewed by NAR’s Executive Committee before going to the board for consideration.</p><p>The committee developed Standard of Practice 10-5, and recommended an expansion of Policy Statement 29 to apply the Code to all activities by Realtors, five years ago against a backdrop of racial unrest following the killing of George Floyd and broad reports of housing discrimination in the U.S. Both recommendations were approved by the board on Nov. 13, 2020.</p><p>Since then, the policies have been subject to several challenges, and discussions about possible revisions have been underway for nearly a year. Throughout those discussions, NAR leaders said that they strongly believed in preserving SOP 10-5 but that updates were necessary to protect Article 10’s intent and to make the Code of Ethics “more sustainable and defensible to legal challenges.”</p><h3 id="new-standard-applies-immediately">New Standard Applies Immediately</h3><p>At the June 5 meeting, NAR Professional Standards Committee Chair Todd Beckstrom of Chapin, SC, introduced the recommended language changes, saying they would reduce uncertainty and risk for state and local associations and the volunteer leaders who administer and enforce Article 10 and would bring NAR’s standard in line with similar ethical requirements applied by other large trade associations across the country. Board members agreed, approving the measure.</p><p>The revised language will be effective immediately. In a letter to key stakeholders following board ratification of the changes, NAR President Kevin Sears explained the rationale for the changes and reiterated NAR’s commitment “to upholding principles of fair housing and equal treatment for all consumers.”</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>At the 2025 Realtors Legislative Meetings, the National Association of Realtors Executive Committee voted to repeal the optional non-commingling rule. The decision was based on MLS-community feedback about the rule’s declining usage and relevance in local marketplaces, according to a NAR spokesman. For more information, please see the Executive Committee’s report on actions taken at RLM in the library of filed reports.</p><p><em>About the author: Stacey Moncrieff is executive editor of publications for the National Association of Realtors and editor in chief of Realtor Magazine.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The newly amended PCDS must be used beginning July 1, 2025.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>The following is the full text of a Legal Update sent by email by the New York State Association of Realtors earlier today (July 9) to its membership.</p><p>Dear NYSAR member,</p><p>On Sept. 27, 2024, Governor Hochul signed into law an amendment to the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which added a new paragraph as part of question 36. The new paragraph states, “More information on ‘septic system operation and maintenance’ can be found on the NYS Department of Health website in the informational health pamphlet made available by the Department of Health pursuant to section 396-s of NYS general business law.” The newly amended PCDS must be used beginning July 1, 2025. A copy of the newly amended PCDS can be found here: <a href="https://dos.ny.gov/property-condition-disclosure-statement-eff-7125">https://dos.ny.gov/property-condition-disclosure-statement-eff-7125</a></p><h3 id="newly-amended-pcds">Newly Amended PCDS</h3><p>Section 466 of the Real Property Law (RPL) requires real estate licensees acting as an exclusive or non-exclusive listing agent to timely inform each seller represented by that agent of the seller’s obligations to fill out the PCDS. An agent representing a buyer of residential real property, or, if the buyer is not represented by an agent, the agent representing a seller of residential real property and dealing with a prospective buyer, shall have the duty to timely (in any event, before the buyer signs a binding contract of sale) inform such buyer of the buyer’s rights and obligations under the PCDS law. If an agent performs the aforementioned duties and obligations, the agent shall have no further duties and shall not be liable to any party for a violation of this article.</p><p>NYSAR is recommending that licensees provide a copy of the PCDS to the seller and inform the seller to discuss filling out the PCDS with their attorney. Licensees should not be assisting the seller in filling out the PCDS.</p><p>The date the listing was taken has no impact on whether the amended PCDS is required. As was true with prior PCDS amendments, the amended form may impact current listings taken prior to July 1, 2025. Below is a summary of such impact.</p><p>Section 462(1) of the Real Property Law (RPL) provides, in part, “Except as is provided in section four hundred sixty-three of this article, every seller of residential real property pursuant to a real estate purchase contract shall complete and sign a property condition disclosure statement as prescribed by subdivision two of this section and cause it, or a copy thereof, to be delivered to a buyer or buyer’s agent prior to the signing by the buyer of a binding contract of sale. A copy of the property condition disclosure statement containing the signatures of both seller and buyer shall be attached to the real estate purchase contract.”</p><p>If a contract of sale has already been fully executed with the signed PCDS then the seller met their obligation. If the seller provides the PCDS, at listing, but there is no “buyer” yet, such disclosure is not effective since it was not signed by the “buyer” as required under 462(1) and the newly amended form must be used. When the “buyer” signs the disclosure, it should conform to the law at the time it was given. Therefore, if a listing was taken prior to July 1, 2025, and the PCDS was provided by the seller but it was not signed by the buyer prior to July 1, 2025, the newly amended PCDS must be used instead. Likewise, if the listing was taken prior to July 1, 2025, the seller would need to fill out and provide to the buyer or buyer’s agent the newly amended PCDS prior to the signing of a binding contract of sale.</p><p>The following should answer any questions as to whether the amended PCDS would be required.</p><h3 id="amended-pcds-required">Amended PCDS Required</h3><p>If the seller has already provided the PCDS to the buyer and the buyer has not signed the PCDS prior to July 1, 2025, the amended PCDS is required.</p><p>If the seller has not provided the PCDS and a binding contract of sale is entered into on or after July 1, 2025, the amended PCDS is required.</p><h3 id="amended-pcds-not-required">Amended PCDS Not Required</h3><p>If the seller has already provided the PCDS to the buyer and the buyer signed prior to July 1, 2025, the amended PCDS is not required.</p><p>If the seller and buyer entered into a binding contract of sale prior to July 1, 2025, the amended form is not required.</p><p>For those licensees that want to utilize the newly amended PCDS prior to the July 1, 2025 effective date, such use would be permitted if the licensee discloses to the seller that they are not required to use the newly amended PCDS and by doing so they are providing additional disclosures about septic system operation and maintenance.</p><p>For those buyers inquiring about obtaining a copy of the “Septic system operation and maintenance” pamphlet, the Department of Health has provided the following link: <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/3208/">https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/3208/</a>.</p><p>NYSAR members with legal questions about their licensed activities can contact the NYSAR Legal Hotline Monday-Friday from 9:00am-4:00pm at 518-436-9727 or 518-43-NYSAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Small investors purchased 361,900 homes in 2024, a 3.7% year-over-year increase, while large investor purchases decreased by 8.7% to 132,500 homes, the lowest level since 2018.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—While the share of homes purchased by investors edged slightly higher, investor selling hit a record high with 10.8% of sellers representing investors in 2024, the highest investor seller share in the data's history, according to a report out today from Realtor.com. This significant shift in investor market participation comes as the overall housing market continues to adjust from the pandemic-era frenzy, with inventory levels improving, home price growth leveling off and rents easing.</p><blockquote>“Investor trends signal a transition,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist, Realtor.com. “Nationwide, investors picked up more homes on net in 2024, as smaller investors were a growing majority of investor buyers. But with investor selling at a new high, the market saw the smallest net investor buying activity in five years, lessening one of the notable headwinds for entry-level buyers who often compete with investors.”</blockquote><p>Nationally, 13.0% of homes purchased in 2024 were bought by investors, a slight increase from 2023 but still below the 2022 peak of 13.3%. This increase occurred in part due to a decrease in total home sales, indicating a growing presence of investors in a smaller market. On the sell side, investors accounted for 10.8% of sellers in 2024, the highest share on record, up from 10.1% in 2023. This shift resulted in the smallest margin between investor buying and selling since 2019, suggesting a reduced net impact of investor demand on overall supply.</p><h3 id="small-investors-share-growing">Small Investors Share Growing</h3><p>A significant trend observed in the 2024 data was the growing dominance of small investors. Small investors, defined as those entities that have purchased fewer than 10 homes, made up 59.2% of investor purchases, the highest share in the data’s history. In contrast, large investor activity, which includes entities who have purchased 50 or more homes, fell to 21.7% of purchases, the lowest since 2007. Small investors purchased 361,900 homes in 2024, a 3.7% year-over-year increase, while large investor purchases decreased by 8.7% to 132,500 homes, the lowest level since 2018.</p><h3 id="fewer-investors-purchase-in-all-cash">Fewer Investors Purchase in All-Cash</h3><p>While all-cash sales became more prevalent in the overall housing market in 2024, investors were more likely to utilize debt. All-cash investor sales fell to their lowest level since 2008, although they remained nearly double the cash share of total home sales. Small investors saw the cash purchase share fall from its peak of 65.6% in 2023 to 62.0% in 2024, the lowest small investor cash purchase share since 2008. The large investor cash purchase share fell from 73.2% in 2023 to 68.9% in 2024, the lowest level since 2015.</p><h3 id="investors-pick-affordable-bustling-states-for-investment">Investors Pick Affordable, Bustling States for Investment</h3><p>Regionally, investor activity varied considerably. Missouri (21.2%), Oklahoma (18.7%), and Kansas (18.4%) had the highest investor buyer share, while Oklahoma (16.7%), Missouri (16.7%), and Georgia (15.9%) saw the highest share of investor sellers. In terms of net impact on supply, Hawaii, Montana and Washington D.C. experienced the largest net-negative impact (more buyers than sellers), while California, Minnesota and Oregon saw the largest net-positive impact (more sellers than buyers). The states with the largest growth in investor buying share compared to 2023 were Delaware, Ohio and Washington D.C., while investor selling grew the most in Mississippi, Nevada and South Dakota.</p><p>In the New York metro region, the investor buyer share was 12.7%, nearly flat from the previous year (+0.5%).</p><blockquote>“Investor strategies vary across the U.S.,” said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst, Realtor.com. “In some states like Hawaii, Montana and Washington, D.C., investors are still net buyers, competing with first-time buyers for entry-level housing inventory. This contrasts with markets like California, Minnesota and Oregon, where investors are net sellers, creating opportunities for aspiring homeowners.”</blockquote><p>Among the 150 largest U.S. metros, Springfield, MO, Memphis, TN and Wichita, KS, recorded the highest investor buyer share. Memphis, TN; Oklahoma City and Springfield, MO, led in investor seller share. On a net basis, investors most significantly boosted demand in Miami, Pittsburgh and New York, while they added most to supply in Sacramento, Minneapolis and Portland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[On June 12, the Zoning Board of Appeals rejected an application for a height variance on the project by a 4-0 vote.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WAYWAYANDA—The plan to develop a 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon robotic fulfillment center off Route 6 in Slate Hill in Orange County was dealt a major blow on Thursday night when the Town of Wawayanda’s Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously to reject a needed height variance.</p><p>The $607-million project proposed by a partnership of Scannell Properties of Indianapolis, IN and Amazon Services, LLC, is considered to be among the largest ever private investment projects in Orange County. The plan calls for the construction of a five-story, 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon robotic fulfillment/distribution center in Slate Hill. The project faced critical review earlier this week by the Wawaynada Planning Board, Zoning Board of Appeals and the Orange County Industrial Development Agency.</p><p>At press time it is not known if the project can or will move forward at the site. Scannell Properties, the property owner, had no comment on the ZBA’s denial vote. A response from Amazon on its plans was not received as yet. Proponents of the project have included some area politicians, business and building trades organizations that cited the tremendous economic impact it would have on the area. Opponents have included some area politicians, as well as neighborhood organizations, who cited traffic and environmental concerns as well as opposition to incentives to the e-commerce giant.</p><p>The Wawayanda Planning Board met on Jan. 11 and issued a negative declaration on environmental impact, which was critical for the project to move forward. However, on June 12, the Zoning Board of Appeals rejected an application for a height variance on the project by a 4-0 vote. <em>Mid Hudson News</em> first reported the ZBA’s denial of the height variance.</p><p>On June 10, the Orange County Industrial Development Agency held a public hearing on the proposed incentives for the Amazon project at the Minisink Middle School.</p><p>Some of the project highlights include the construction of a five-story facility with each floor consisting of approximately 600,000 square feet of space. According to IDA documents, the partnership states that the completed facility will create at least 750 new jobs within three years of completion of construction. L. Todd Diorio, president of the Hudson Valley Building and Construction Trades Council, stated that to secure IDA incentives, the developer must adhere to the IDA’s local labor policy that requires at least 85% local labor work on the project. He said that he fully expected the project to be built predominately by union tradesmen and that initial contracts that have been let appear to be going to union contractors. He estimated the development will result in more than 1 million construction man-hours to complete the facility.</p><p>Diorio stated that the proposal is the largest industrial project in memory and exceeds the LEGOLAND New York project in Goshen, NY, in terms of investment. He estimated the Amazon facility will entail approximately $500 million in construction activity. A large contingent of members of the building trades have attended public hearings on the project.</p><p>Back in 2023, Scannell and Amazon secured approvals for a 900,000-square-foot warehouse at the 22 McBride Road site, but eventually submitted a much larger proposal. The 100-acre property is currently an active quarry.</p><p>The Scannell-Amazon venture is currently seeking state and local sales tax exemptions from the Orange County IDA of up to $18,821,250 for qualified expenditures of up to $250 million and another $12,187,500 for state and local sales taxes in connection with other qualified expenditures of up to $150 million, putting the proposed total exemptions at more than $31 million. The venture will also be seeking a PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) with the Minisink School District and other taxing jurisdictions.</p><p>Approximately 250 people attended the IDA public hearing session. Local community groups and some politicians, including New York State Sen. James Skoufis and Democratic County Executive candidate Michael Sussman spoke against the incentives, stating that the e-commerce giant does not need the incentives for the project.</p><p>Other politicians, including local State Assemblyman Karl Brabenec, Brian Maher, business groups including the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, the Orange County Partnership, the Hudson Valley Economic Development Corp., the Construction Contractors Association, as well as a host of representatives of the area’s building trades spoke in favor of the incentive package on the table for Amazon.</p><p>In addition to the hundreds of construction jobs, the members of the building trades noted that Amazon would pay approximately $90 million in taxes over the 20-year PILOT, while the current property owner, which leases the parcel as a working mine, would pay $4 million over the next two decades in taxes.</p><p>Wawayanda Supervisor Denise Quinn, in written testimony submitted to the Orange County IDA, stated that she has requested a meeting with Amazon representatives to renegotiate the current proposed PILOT.</p><p>While noting that the current PILOT agreement would require Amazon to hire local construction workers to build the project (the IDA incentives require 85% local hires), Ms. Quinn stated: “We know that in the absence of this PILOT agreement, Amazon, as of right, would be entitled to various New York State tax incentive programs worth millions, without having to hire local employees and purchase materials locally. However, after looking at the current 20-year PILOT being offered, I believe our community can do better. While we respect the Orange County IDA’s process and understand this PILOT’s schedule is available as part of the Uniform Tax Exemption Policy (UTEP), I would like to formally request a meeting with Amazon representatives to discuss a deviation from the current PILOT agreement being proposed.”</p><p>She continued, “I would like to have this conversation in good faith to explore other options. I believe we need to do better than what is in front of us. It is my hope we can come to an agreement that preserves this project and its potential positive impacts.”</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>This is a developing story.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PEARL RIVER—U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY-17) announced today that in response to the draft release of the Senate version of the “Big Beautiful” bill that would keep the SALT Cap at $10,000, he will vote against the bill if it reaches the House in its current form.</p><p>The House passed its version of the Big Beautiful bill on May 22 with a provision that would raise the SALT Cap to $40,000.</p><blockquote>“I have been clear since Day one: sufficiently lifting the SALT Cap to deliver tax fairness to New Yorkers has been my top priority in Congress,” said Congressman Lawler. “After engaging in good faith negotiations, we were able to increase the cap on SALT from $10,000 to $40,000. That is the deal, and I will not accept a penny less. If the Senate reduces the SALT number, I will vote No, and the bill will fail in the House.”</blockquote><p>He added, “I, along with my fellow SALT Caucus members, are actively engaging with Senators, House Leadership, and the White House and am confident the deal as previously negotiated will be in the final bill that is signed into law.”</p><p>New York Democrats, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, have pressed lawmakers in Washington to fully repeal the SALT cap. However, GOP Senators seem to be dialing down any hope for a repeal or even raising the cap at this point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR) proudly joined thousands of members from across the country at the 2025 National Association of Realtors (NAR) Legislative Meetings in Washington, D.C. This annual gathering is more than a conference—it’s the single most impactful week of advocacy for our profession, our industry, and the homeowners we serve every day.</p><p>While many of our 13,000 members couldn’t attend in person, rest assured: your voice was in the room. Your HGAR Government Affairs team walked the halls of Congress to meet directly with key lawmakers and advocate for the policies that shape your business and your communities. </p><h3 id="meeting-face-to-face-with-lawmakers">Meeting Face-to-Face with Lawmakers</h3><p>During our time in Washington, we met with a strong slate of federal representatives whose districts include or neighbor HGAR’s footprint. These meetings included productive and engaging conversations with:</p><p><strong>Representative Daniel Goldman (NY-10)</strong></p><p><strong>Representative George Latimer (NY-16)</strong></p><p><strong>Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13)</strong></p><p><strong>Representative Michael Lawler (NY-17)</strong></p><p><strong>Representative Ritchie Torres (NY-15)</strong></p><p><strong>Representative Pat Ryan (NY-18)</strong></p><p>Each of these elected officials heard directly from Realtors about the challenges facing the real estate industry—especially in the areas of housing affordability, inventory constraints, small business taxation and the growing barriers to homeownership.</p><p>These weren’t casual drop-ins. They were structured, well-prepared visits supported by NAR's legislative priorities and policy research. The message was clear: our industry needs strong federal support to meet the housing needs of today’s America.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/06/Lobby-Day-2025-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="462" height="462"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">(L to R) Max Gurvitch, Max WM Gurvitch Realtor; Jemaine “Dr. J” Meadows, Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors; Irene Guanill, De Luca Realty Group Inc.; Anthony Domathoti, Exit Realty Premium; Congress Member Adriano Espaillat; Christina Stevens, Laujel Realty Corp; Sandra Erickson, Sandra Erickson Real State; Lynda Fernandez, CEO, Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors; and Barrington Richards, Fine Choice Realty.</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-we-went-the-federal-priorities-driving-realtor-advocacy">Why We Went: The Federal Priorities Driving Realtor Advocacy</h3><p>The Realtor delegation representing every state and territory rallied around several core issues that require Congressional action. These priorities were rooted in three strategic goals:</p><ul>
<li>Expanding housing opportunity</li>
<li>Protecting the Realtor business model</li>
<li>Supporting homeownership for all Americans</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the legislative proposals we presented is a tangible step toward achieving those goals.</p><h3 id="building-housing-supply-and-opportunity-for-all">Building Housing Supply and Opportunity for All</h3><p>The U.S. is currently facing a housing deficit of 4.7 million units—a crisis that continues to drive up prices and lock out first-time buyers. HGAR and NAR are calling for federal legislation that will help increase housing inventory, lower regulatory barriers, and incentivize development and turnover.</p><h3 id="more-homes-on-the-market-act-hr-1340">More Homes on the Market Act (H.R. 1340)</h3><p>This bill aims to encourage long-time homeowners to sell by reducing the capital gains tax penalty. For many seniors or long-term owners, the fear of a hefty tax bill is a key reason they stay put freeing them from that burden could bring much-needed homes to market.</p><h3 id="housing-supply-and-affordability-act-hr-2840-s-1299">Housing Supply and Affordability Act (H.R. 2840 / S. 1299)</h3><p>This bipartisan proposal would create a grant program to help local governments reform zoning and permitting processes often the most significant bottlenecks in creating new housing. If passed, this act could unlock more local development across Westchester, the Bronx, and the Hudson Valley.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/06/thumbnail_IMG_2472-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/thumbnail_IMG_2472-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/thumbnail_IMG_2472-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/thumbnail_IMG_2472-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/06/thumbnail_IMG_2472-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">HGAR contingent meeting with U.S. Rep.

This bill supports adaptive reuse of commercial properties, turning them into residential units in walkable, transit-friendly areas.</p><h3 id="uplifting-first-time-homebuyers-act-hr-3526">Uplifting First-Time Homebuyers Act (H.R. 3526)</h3><p>This bill proposes increasing the amount first-time buyers can withdraw from IRAs penalty-free for home purchases. Especially in high-cost markets like ours, boosting down payment flexibility can be a game-changer for young buyers.</p><h3 id="fair-and-equal-housing-act">Fair and Equal Housing Act</h3><p>This important legislation would amend the Fair Housing Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. This aligns with our profession’s commitment to fairness, equality, and inclusive access to housing.</p><h3 id="supporting-the-self-employed-protecting-the-realtor-business-model">Supporting the Self-Employed: Protecting the Realtor Business Model</h3><p>The Realtor community is powered by entrepreneurs. In fact, 88% of Realtors are classified as independent contractors—a model that offers the flexibility and autonomy necessary for success in our business. But that model is increasingly under threat, especially as federal rules and tax policies evolve.</p><p>That’s why HGAR strongly advocated for three bills designed to protect and empower self-employed professionals:</p><h3 id="association-health-plans-act-hr-2528-s-1847">Association Health Plans Act (H.R. 2528 / S. 1847)</h3><p>Health care remains a top concern for independent contractors. This bill would make it easier for Realtor associations to offer affordable group plans, giving members better access to quality coverage at reasonable rates.</p><h3 id="direct-seller-and-real-estate-agent-harmonization-act-hr-3495">Direct Seller and Real Estate Agent Harmonization Act (H.R. 3495)</h3><p>This legislation preserves the independent contractor status of real estate agents, ensuring we are not swept into misclassification legislation that could upend how agents operate.</p><h3 id="main-street-tax-certainty-act-hr-703-s-213">Main Street Tax Certainty Act (H.R. 703 / S. 213)</h3><p>This bill would make permanent the 20% deduction for pass-through business income—an essential tax benefit for small businesses and sole proprietors. Without this extension, Realtors could face a sharp increase in their federal tax burden beginning in 2026.</p><h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next-bringing-the-advocacy-home">What’s Next: Bringing the Advocacy Home</h3><p>Advocating in Washington is just one piece of the puzzle. Our work continues here at home, in our communities and with our local officials.</p><p>That’s why we’re inviting all HGAR members to take the next step by getting involved in local grassroots advocacy.</p><h3 id="save-the-date-june-25-at-200-pm-%E2%80%93-local-political-coordinator-lpc-training">Save the Date: June 25 at 2:00 PM – Local Political Coordinator (LPC) Training</h3><p>Our Local Political Coordinator program empowers HGAR members to act as liaisons between the Realtor community and local elected officials.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS, the largest multiple listing service in New York, released its May 2025 market report on June 17 that highlighted steady median home prices and a healthy uptick in new listings throughout the New York Metropolitan area.</p><p>In May 2025, the closed median sales price for single-family homes rose to $735,000, marking a 3.5% year-over-year increase. Despite tighter inventory in some areas, the market has remained resilient, demonstrating continued buyer demand and strong seller conﬁdence. Condominiums saw a slight dip in median price by 5.3% to $539,660, while coop prices remained steady at around $299,000.</p><blockquote>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, noted, “While we’re seeing subtle changes across property types, the broader market reﬂects solid stability. Buyers are adjusting to current interest rates, and sellers are responding by bringing more listings to the market. This spring has been characterized by motivated buyers and well-priced homes moving quickly, especially single-family properties that continue to attract competitive offers.”</blockquote><p>New listings for single-family homes increased by 3.8% compared to last May, with 5,801 homes hitting the market in May alone. Condos and co-ops also saw new listings rise by 6.5% and 3.4% respectively, providing more options for buyers navigating a historically tight housing market.</p><p>As summer approaches, OneKey MLS expects market activity to remain brisk, driven by sustained buyer interest and a gradual improvement in available inventory.

    <description><![CDATA[At its Mid-Year Meeting, NAR also officially rescinded its “Non-Commingling Rule,” which was an optional policy that permitted Multiple Listing Services to limit display of listings online.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The real estate landscape in New York is continuously evolving, with significant updates from the National Association of Realtors’ new local regulations like the New York City Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act (the FARE Act), and updates to New York State’s Property Condition Disclosure Statement. This article provides a comprehensive summary of these developments to help real estate agents stay informed and compliant while effectively serving their clients.</p><h3 id="national-association-of-realtors-updates">National Association of Realtors Updates</h3><p><br><em>Update to Standard of Practice 10-5</em></p><p>On June 5, 2025, at its Mid-Year Legislative Meetings held in Washington, D.C., NAR updated Standard of Practice (SOP) 10-5 and Professional Standards Policy Statement 29 (“Policy Statement 29”), which are part of Article 10 of NAR’s Code of Ethics. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/4kTr7tR">https://bit.ly/4kTr7tR</a>]. As NAR explains, “Article 10 prohibits REALTORS® from denying equal professional services and employment opportunities based on protected characteristics. NAR adopted SOP 10-5 in 2020 to further clarify the application of Article 10 by prohibiting REALTORS® from using harassing speech, hate speech, epithets, or slurs.” NAR further explains that “the updated language now aligns the definition of ‘harassment’ with the NAR Member Code of Conduct and focuses its application on instances in which REALTORS® are operating in their professional capacity, consistent with similar ethical requirements applied by other large trade associations across the country.”</p><p>Policy Statement 29, which applies to the “applicability of the Code of Ethics” to professional standards matters, was revised to read as follows, in part: “…a REALTOR® shall be subject to disciplinary action under the Code of Ethics only with respect to their capacity as real estate professionals, in association with their real estate businesses, or in their real estate-related activities.” [See <a href="http://bit.ly/3HGIwY1">http://bit.ly/3HGIwY1</a>].</p><p>Additionally, SOP 10-5 was revised as follows: “REALTORS®, in their capacity as real estate professionals, in association with their real estate businesses, or in their real estate-related activities shall not harass any person or persons based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.” [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3FZhUks">https://bit.ly/3FZhUks</a>]. The updated SOP 10-5 now explicitly limits violations to activities directly associated with an agent’s real estate practices.</p><p>For Realtors, this update reinforces the importance of maintaining high ethical standards in all client and professional interactions. For example, a Realtor who engages in behavior prohibited by SOP 10-5 could face disciplinary action, but personal conduct unrelated to the agent’s real estate activities would generally fall outside this scope. According to NAR, the goal of these amendments was to create additional clarity for state and local associations as they enforce the NAR Code of Ethics.</p><p>NAR has clarified that the recently announced changes do not override prior enforcement actions that were reviewed and rendered prior to June 5th. However, any ongoing cases related to SOP 10-5, which have been filed prior to June 5th and for which a decision has not yet been rendered, state and local associations are to use discretion when deciding whether to apply the amended language based on the individual circumstances of each case.</p><p>NAR provides further guidance and explains that in a case where a hearing panel has begun the review and grievance process prior to June 5th, utilizing the original SOP 10-5 (and Policy Statement 29), that panel should continue using those provisions to address an Article 10 complaint. However, where an Article 10 case arose prior to June 5th, but the review and grievance process commenced after June 5th, then the newly amended language of SOP 10-5 (and Policy Statement 29) would apply.</p><p><em>Rescission of the Non-Commingling Rule</em></p><p>At its Mid-Year Meeting, NAR also officially rescinded its “Non-Commingling Rule,” which was an optional policy that permitted Multiple Listing Services to limit display of listings online. The rule, which was contained in Section 18.3.11 and Section 19.23 of NAR’s MLS Policy Handbook, allowed MLSs to prohibit brokers from displaying listings from Realtor-affiliated MLSs alongside listings from other sources (like non-MLS brokers or different MLSs) on the same search results page. This decision was recently supported by a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a lawsuit filed by REX Real Estate against NAR and Zillow. The Ninth Circuit held that the Non-Commingling Rule did not constitute an antitrust violation, as it was not mandatory and many MLSs chose not to implement it.</p><h3 id="nyc-fare-act-updates">NYC FARE Act Updates</h3><p><br><em>Recent Court Dismissal and Denial of Injunction</em></p><p>The NYC FARE Act, which went into effect on June 11, 2025, represents a dramatic shift in the New York City rental market by requiring landlords to pay broker fees for agents they hire, relieving tenants of this financial burden. Earlier this year, the Real Estate Board of New York and the New York State Association of Realtors filed a lawsuit against, and sought an injunction to block, the implementation of the FARE Act, arguing it could lead to higher rents and market confusion. They also alleged that the FARE Act violated constitutional protections based on First Amendment and Contract Clause claims. On April 3, Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration filed an amicus brief asking the court to uphold the law and emphasizing that the FARE Act does not conflict with existing state regulations.</p><p>On June 10th, the trial court denied REBNY’s and NYSAR’s motion, allowing the FARE Act to take effect as expected on June 11th. While the judge in the case dismissed most of the constitutional claims, the “Contract Clause” claim was allowed to stand. REBNY and NYSAR immediately filed a notice on June 12th that they would be appealing the judge’s decision to the Second Circuit.</p><p>For real estate agents, this means a significant change in how rental transactions are structured in New York City. Tenants will no longer be responsible for paying broker fees when the landlord hires the agent, potentially saving renters thousands of dollars in upfront costs. Agents must now focus on negotiating clear agreements with landlords to ensure that their commissions are paid directly by the property owner. This shift may also increase demand for rental properties, as tenants face lower move-in costs, but agents and tenants should be prepared for potential pushback from landlords who may attempt to offset the added costs by raising rents significantly.</p><p><em>Prior Court Decision in 2021:<br>NYS DOS Guidance in 2020 on Rental Commissions</em></p><p>In 2020, the New York State Department of State, after the passage of the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (“2019 Act”), issued a guidance interpreting a part of the 2019 Act as a ban on tenants being forced to pay broker fees. REBNY filed a lawsuit alleging that the DOS had overstepped its authority in issuing its guidance. In April 2021, a judge decided in REBNY’s favor and held that “the guidance was issued in error of law and represents an unlawful intrusion upon the power of the Legislature and constitutes an abuse of discretion.” This decision was likely an important catalyst which ultimately led the New York City Council to pass the FARE Act.</p><p>While the DOS has not issued a formal statement specifically addressing the new FARE Act as of the latest available information, the DOS typically oversees real estate licensing and regulations, ensuring compliance with New York State’s real estate laws and pertinent regulations. Given the FARE Act’s local scope within New York City, the DOS is likely to monitor its implementation to ensure consistency with broader real estate regulations, such as those governing broker conduct and commission agreements, and ensure compliance with the law.</p><h3 id="property-condition-disclosure-act-septic-system-disclosure">Property Condition Disclosure Act: Septic System Disclosure</h3><p>Effective July 1, 2025, New York’s Property Condition Disclosure Act (PCDA) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3Xi8B5C">https://bit.ly/3Xi8B5C</a>] has been amended to introduce new requirements for septic system disclosures in real estate transactions. Paragraph 36 has been added to the PCDS, which requires a seller to disclose the type of sewage system services at the property (i.e., public sewer, private sewer, septic, or cesspool). If the property is served by a septic system or cesspool, it requires the seller to disclose the age of the system, when the system was last pumped, and the frequency of pumping of the system. Lastly, the seller is required to disclose any known material defects. The PCDS also refers purchasers to an informational pamphlet regarding the operation and maintenance of septic systems provided by the New York State Department of Health [see <a href="https://bit.ly/43N3rRV">https://bit.ly/43N3rRV</a>].</p><p>Sellers now will be required to provide detailed information about the condition, maintenance history, and any known issues with septic systems or cesspools on the property. This change aims to enhance transparency and protect buyers from unexpected repair costs, which can be substantial for septic system failures. For seller agents, this update underscores the need to educate sellers about their disclosure obligations and to advise their clients to discuss any potential issues with their attorneys when completing the PCDS. Buyer agents, meanwhile, should ensure that their clients review septic disclosures carefully and consider hiring specialists to inspect and verify the system’s condition. Compliance with the updated PCDA will be critical to avoid liability and ensure smooth transactions.</p><p>It is also important for real estate licensees to note that nothing has changed with respect to their obligations under Section 466 of the PCDA, which requires real estate licensees to timely inform their clients of their rights and obligations under the PCDA. [See <a href="https://bit.ly/3ToS8Jw">https://bit.ly/3ToS8Jw</a>]. Seller agents should not assist sellers with completing the PCDS and should recommend that they reach out to their attorney for assistance.</p><h3 id="agents-must-be-proactive-in-updating-their-knowledge">Agents Must Be Proactive in Updating Their Knowledge</h3><p>The real estate industry in New York is undergoing significant changes, from NAR’s ethical and operational updates to local and state regulations like the FARE Act and PCDA amendments. Coupled with recent court decisions, these developments require agents to stay proactive in updating their knowledge and practices. By understanding and adapting to these changes, real estate professionals can maintain compliance, build client trust, and navigate the complexities of the real estate market with confidence.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq., is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[With this bill in place, all stakeholders from buyers to brokers can expect greater predictability and accountability in a process that has long needed reform.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, in partnership with the New York State Association of Realtors, continued its focused advocacy in support of Intro 1120, a bill introduced by Councilmember Amanda Farías. This legislation seeks to reform the cooperative housing purchase process in New York City by establishing transparency, consistency, and fairness for buyers navigating the notoriously unpredictable world of co-op board approvals. </p><p>Intro 1120, which is currently in the Committee on Housing &amp; Buildings, would:</p><ul>
<li>Require cooperative boards to acknowledge receipt of a purchase application within 10 days;</li>
<li>Set a 45-day deadline from application completion for a board decision;</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow for a one-time 14-day extension if the board needs more time and notifies the applicant accordingly.</p><p>This is a balanced proposal that preserves the authority of co-op boards while protecting buyers from unnecessary delays and opaque decision-making. With this bill in place, all stakeholders from buyers to brokers can expect greater predictability and accountability in a process that has long needed reform.</p><h3 id="meanwhile-a-major-regulatory-shift-has-taken-effect-the-fare-act">Meanwhile, a Major Regulatory Shift Has Taken Effect: The FARE Act</h3><p>As we continue this important legislative push, New York City’s real estate community is also adjusting to a significant change that took effect on June 11, 2025: the implementation of the FARE Act (Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses).</p><p>Passed amidst a busy election cycle and ongoing affordability debates, the FARE Act prohibits real estate brokers who represent landlords, or advertise listings with the landlord's permission, from collecting any compensation from tenants.</p><p>Key provisions include:</p><ul>
<li>A complete ban on landlords’ agents collecting commission or fees from tenants;</li>
<li>A prohibition on co-broke arrangements between landlords’ agents and tenants’ agents, even if the tenant voluntarily pays the tenant’s agent. If the landlord’s agent receives compensation through such a co-broke, it is still deemed a violation.</li>
<li>This sweeping regulation changes the dynamics of rental transactions citywide, raising significant concerns about broker compensation, service models, and access to listings. HGAR is closely monitoring the law’s implementation and its impact on brokers and consumers. We are also actively engaging with policymakers to ensure that the voices of working real estate professionals are heard—and that any unintended consequences are addressed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-work-ahead">More Work Ahead</h3><p>These developments make it clear: there is a lot of work to be done in New York City. From co-op reform to broker compensation, the policies emerging from City Hall are reshaping how real estate is transacted in one of the most competitive markets in the world.<br>And the changes are far from over. At the end of June, the Rent Guidelines Board is scheduled to vote on potential rent freezes or increases for rent-stabilized apartments across the five boroughs. This annual vote affects nearly one million units and will have major implications for both tenants and property owners. HGAR is closely watching the proposals under consideration, particularly in light of ongoing concerns about housing affordability and the financial sustainability of small landlords.</p><p>As we navigate this critical time, especially in the middle of a pivotal election year, HGAR remains committed to fighting for smart, balanced policy that supports fair housing access, consumer protection, and the real estate professionals who make the industry move.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[There are some exciting opportunities and we are seeing these projects come across our desks in a way that we have never seen before. So, we are getting the at-bats and we are taking a swing. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GOSHEN—Earlier this month, Conor Eckert took the reins of the Orange County Partnership that for nearly a quarter century was led by the affable and well-respected Maureen Halahan. The young executive and Orange County native has grand plans for the organization and has made no secret that he is thinking “big.”</p><p>The business community came out in force on June 3 to wish Halahan a fond farewell as she entered retirement, at the Partnership’s MVP (Most Valuable Partner) Award dinner that also honored Construction Contractors Association Executive Director Alan Seidman. However, the event was not exactly a coming-out for Eckert. Most observers knew that this rising star in the field of economic development was being groomed as Halahan’s replacement from his first day on the job and earlier this year the Partnership announced Eckert had been named Interim CEO.</p><p>Halahan, in fact, made it clear that she had grand plans for Eckert when she first hired him as Senior Development Officer and Vice President of Business Attraction in March 2022 at the age of 25 when she said: “The Orange County Partnership has for years attracted the finest home-grown talent and our addition of Conor Eckert continues this fine tradition. We have had our eye on Conor ever since he graduated from SUNY Binghamton and since then we have watched him develop his craft in the Town of Montgomery. He is a well-respected and knowledgeable young professional who is going to hit the ground running here at the Orange County Partnership.”</p><p>When he first joined the Orange County Partnership, Eckert was already widely known and respected in the business and economic development communities in Orange County and the Mid-Hudson region. He served almost two years as the Executive Director of the Town of Montgomery Industrial Development Agency and Director of Economic Development for the Town of Montgomery where he was involved in helping attract and secure incentives for new projects that included the new Amazon fulfillment center.</p><p>He was responsible for the business attraction, retention and expansion efforts in the Town of Montgomery, managing a growing project portfolio of more than $200 million. He also managed the public and community affairs and operations of the IDA. During his time with the Montgomery IDA, he spearheaded new marketing initiatives, community engagement events and initiated and implemented successful economic development strategies.</p><p>Eckert, an Orange County resident, is a graduate of Pine Bush High School and Orange County Community College. He graduated in 2019 from SUNY Binghamton with a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science and Government and earned his Master’s Degree of Public Administration from SUNY Binghamton in 2020.</p><p>For more than three years Eckert worked with Halahan on major transactions and initiatives and now hopes to lead the organization in new directions that will take advantage of the economic landscape of today and tomorrow. To get a glimpse into Eckert’s plans going forward, see below:</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: Your first day was on June 3 as CEO of the Orange County Partnership. You take on the job after Maureen Halahan's more than 20 years of leading the organization? What are your thoughts on your new position and Maureen's contributions to the region during her tenure?</em></p><p><strong>Eckert: </strong>That’s a good question. I think I will start with the second part of your question with Maureen. She has left a legacy that few people ever had before. She is a force, she is a legend and I am blessed to have her as a mentor and learn from Maureen. She really helped form a lot of my approach and a lot of people’s approach to economic development and (forging) relationships. The legacy she left is unmatched and stands on its own. It’s an honor for me to fill in her shoes and continue her legacy.</p><p>On the position, it is equally an honor to run the organization. We have got an almost 40-year history here of advancing economic development. I am a local guy. I was born and raised here. For me to be able to run an organization that can directly impact the way our community looks and feels and to advance the economy is an honor. Personally, a large goal of mine is for the companies we attract, I want to keep our young people and our talent, so that they don’t have to go to New York City or other major markets. So, to be able to play a role in that and to lead this organization, with the legacy of Maureen, that can impact the community for the better—that’s deeply meaningful for me.</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: At the Most Valuable Partner event recently, you said the Partnership will not be afraid to take a "big swing" at large investment projects. Does Orange County have the sites, the infrastructure and the available qualified workforce to attract such mega-projects?</em></p><p><strong>Eckert:</strong> That’s the question that communities across the country are asking themselves in the context of the scale and velocity of projects that are looking to populate across the United States. I would say that yes, we are going to take big swings and be bold and aggressive because we need to, because we are now not just competing with our counterparts in the Northeast… but we are competing for projects with other countries and other regions across the United States of America.</p><p>Concerning your question on whether we have the assets to compete with these sectors, I think it is a strong “Yes". And when we look at these sectors that we are talking about—pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing, food and beverage and semiconductors, specifically the (semiconductor) supply chain, you are not looking at projects that need a gigawatt of power and five million gallons of water and sewer a day. Those sites are very difficult to find just generally in the country. You are looking at requirements that are anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 gallons of water and sewer a day, anywhere from 5 to 20 megawatts of power and 250,000 square feet to 800,000 square feet of space. These are scaled projects and the types of infrastructure we can accommodate. Particularly, we are excited about pharmaceutical production given the heritage of pharma innovation in the region. We think Orange County is the next logical area of pharmaceutical growth in the region, expanding from Westchester and Rockland. We are also excited about the semiconductor supply chain and that is the production of tools and equipment and front- and back-end R&amp;D and advanced packaging. Now, these projects are not as intensive as a fab (facility) where you need a gigawatt of power. Those aforementioned projects are right in our wheelhouse from an infrastructure, talent and site perspectives.</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: The Orange County Partnership has made a distinct pivot towards attempting to attract advanced technology firms to the county. Can you explain the reasons behind this new initiative and its chances of success?</em></p><p><strong>Eckert:</strong> I think the reason is that the diversity of the economy is the resilience of the economy. As the world changes around us, we took a look at Orange County and generally the Hudson Valley and I think we have a story to tell as it comes to attracting advanced sectors given our access to markets, talent, site development and infrastructure. This diversity is critical for the economic sustainability of our market, but it is also an opportunity I think to change the fundamentals of the market. And I think there is a high chance of success. Just look at the existing regional ecosystem of Regeneron, Pfizer, Pratt &amp; Whitney and President Container and recently Poly Craft and Tesla… We have this heritage of advanced technology and manufacturing in this region and Orange County has a proliferation of shovel-ready sites, infrastructure and strong leadership from the top to the bottom. So, I think the ecosystem, in addition to the market fundamentals of labor, talent, sites, infrastructure and markets positions us well to capture this advanced technology economy.</p><p>When we say advanced technology, we really mean pharmaceutical manufacturing, food and beverage, semiconductors and the semiconductor supply chain, clean tech and clean tech production. There are some exciting opportunities and we are seeing these projects come across our desks in a way that we have never seen before. So, we are getting the at-bats and we are taking a swing.</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: Speaking of large projects, Scannell Development and Amazon were recently turned aside in a vote by the Zoning Board of Appeals for a 3.2-million-square-foot robotic distribution center in the Town of Wawayanda. This I believe would have been the largest private industrial project in the history of Orange County and would have infused millions of dollars into the local economy and created hundreds of construction jobs and more than 750 permanent jobs upon completion. What are your thoughts on this project and the reasons why it failed to secure local approvals necessary to proceed?</em></p><p><strong>Eckert: </strong>We continue to stand firmly in support of the proposed Amazon project in the Town of Wawayanda, recognizing the significant economic and community benefits it would bring to the region. We appreciate the concerns raised by the local zoning board and will continue to assess the situation moving forward.</p><p>At the same time, we remain deeply energized by the growing activity and opportunities emerging across the Orange County market. This summer, we anticipate announcing several key projects spanning multiple sectors, including Life Sciences, Food &amp; Beverage, and Logistics.</p><p>The momentum in Orange County is undeniable, and we are excited to help drive the next wave of sustainable development that will benefit not only the local economy but the broader community as well.</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth: What do you believe are the key impediments to economic growth in Orange County?</em></p><p><strong>Eckert:</strong> I think our impediments are the same as what communities are facing across the country. One is ensuring that infrastructure is modernized to the point that we can keep up with the velocity of projects that we are seeing. When you look at the country, 70% of the country’s transmission and distribution infrastructure is over 20 years old. As we are seeing a proliferation of data centers, semiconductors and battery manufacturing plants, it becomes difficult as a country for us to site these projects. So, when you look at the infrastructure map as a country and Orange County is included in that, we need to keep our eye on the ball when it comes to power and utility infrastructure. Also, I don’t think it is a problem but more of an opportunity is that our market is proactively training the talent of tomorrow for advanced manufacturing skills. That is a critical initiative for us to stay ahead of the curve and having the talent for these (advanced) manufacturing projects will always be a key variable. We have our eye on that and we are going to make sure we are training the workforce of tomorrow 10 years before we have a project.</p><p>Also, housing has become part of the equation in a way I haven’t seen before in industrial site selection. I have projects asking me how many units of housing are generally under construction within a 45-minute radius of the site. So, the industrial projects, especially the innovative sectors like pharmaceutical manufacturing and life sciences, are asking about these quality of life amenities, not just housing, but access to mass transportation, walkability and quality of life are all creeping in. But housing has become a key variable for not just retaining our talent, but attracting companies and attracting new talent to the community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The Federal Circuit’s decision underscores the rights of property owners to pursue compensation claims arising from the CDC eviction moratorium.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: This article first appeared on June 20, 2025, in <em>Realtor Magazine.</em></p><p>In a major development for property rights advocates, a new court ruling reaffirms that landlords have the right to pursue compensation claims for losses suffered during the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eviction moratorium.</p><p>On June 6, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied the federal government’s petition for a rehearing in <em>Darby v. United States</em>, a case claiming the CDC’s eviction moratorium was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.</p><p>The decision marks a significant victory for property owners. By upholding the Darby ruling, the court maintains the legal framework that protects housing providers against uncompensated government takings.</p><h3 id="darby-v-united-states">Darby v. United States</h3><p>The roots of the case trace back to September 2020, when the CDC, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, imposed a nationwide moratorium on residential evictions. While intended to curb the spread of the virus, the order placed significant financial strain on many mom-and-pop housing providers, who were left without income.</p><p>The case was brought by the Georgia and Alabama Associations of Realtors and other property providers, with legal advocacy support from the National Association of Realtors. In July 2021, the Darby plaintiffs sued the U.S. government, claiming the CDC’s eviction moratorium was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation.</p><p>Although the Supreme Court later ruled the CDC had exceeded its authority, the government argued claims couldn’t arise from unauthorized actions. The Federal Circuit disagreed, holding that the moratorium could still be considered authorized for takings analysis, allowing housing providers to pursue compensation.</p><h3 id="nar%E2%80%99s-legal-advocacy-at-work">NAR’s Legal Advocacy at Work</h3><p>NAR played a critical role in this case, filing an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs and forcefully arguing that the CDC moratorium constituted a per se taking. NAR made clear that the eviction ban had widespread, devastating financial consequences for housing providers, especially independent owners of small rental properties.</p><p>When the CDC’s moratorium was originally struck down, NAR issued a statement: “No federal agency should have the authority to override property rights and create sweeping policy without Congressional action.”</p><h3 id="what-comes-next">What Comes Next?</h3><p>While the Federal Circuit’s decision is a meaningful win for property owners, the legal battle may not be over. The denial of the government’s rehearing request was not unanimous, and the government may still petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.</p><p>Regardless of the final outcome, this ruling ensures that property owners will have their day in court—and underscores the enduring importance of protecting constitutional property rights.</p><p>“NAR is the largest private property rights organization in America, and this mission remains a cornerstone of our legal advocacy efforts. As this case develops, NAR will continue to monitor proceedings closely and advocate on behalf of its members and property owners across the country,” says Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer.</p><p>“The Federal Circuit’s decision underscores an essential principle: even in times of crisis, the constitutional rights of property owners must be respected,” McGahn says. “That’s why NAR strongly advocated for more than $50 billion in rental assistance payments during the pandemic. This solution helped those tenants truly in need while also protecting the rights and livelihoods of mom-and-pop housing providers.”</p><p><em>About the author: Michael Rauber is manager of advocacy communications at the National Association of Realtors.</em></p><p><em>Reprinted from REALTOR® Magazine by permission of the National Association of REALTORS®.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales rose in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales elevated in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but retreated in the West.

    <description><![CDATA[The median price of a single-family home in Westchester rose to $999,000 in May, up 2% from a year ago, underscoring just how resilient demand remains.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors released its May 2025 housing market report on June 23, highlighting continued price growth across much of the Hudson Valley and surrounding counties, even as buyer activity and inventory trends vary from region to region. Based on data from OneKey MLS, the report shows a market where sellers still benefit from strong home values, while buyers are learning to move strategically amid affordability pressures, the report states.</p><blockquote>“The median price of a single-family home in Westchester rose to $999,000 in May, up 2% from a year ago, underscoring just how resilient demand remains,” said HGAR CEO Lynda Fernandez. “Sellers continue to benefit from tight inventory conditions, but buyers are adjusting by exploring more affordable areas or property types. This is where our Realtors bring critical value, helping both sides navigate an increasingly nuanced market.”</blockquote><p>Market conditions continue to vary widely depending on price point and property type. Entry-level homes under $500,000 remain in especially high demand across the region, with limited availability in many areas. As a result, buyers in this price range are facing stiff competition and often need to make swift, compelling offers. In contrast, properties priced above $1 million, particularly in Westchester and parts of Rockland counties, are seeing longer days on market and more room for negotiation. While overall inventory has increased in select counties, it is not evenly distributed, and the supply of turnkey, move-in-ready homes remains well below demand.</p><p>While inventory remains tight in many parts of the region, the months of supply metric reveals early signs of easing in several counties. In May 2025:</p><p><strong>Westchester County</strong>: 2.8 months (+3.7%)—Still deeply in the seller’s market territory, keeping upward pressure on prices.</p><p><strong>Putnam County</strong>: 3.4 months (+17%)—Improved inventory gives buyers more options and negotiating power.</p><p><strong>Orange County</strong>: 3.9 months (+8.3%)—A balanced trend that may ease competition in this value-driven market</p><p><strong>Rockland County</strong>: 3.3 months (+18%)—Rising supply creates opportunities for buyers, especially in condos and co-ops.</p><p><strong>Bronx County</strong>: 8.6 months (condos, co-ops and townhomes) (+6.2%)—Now approaching a buyer’s market, offering greater flexibility and choice.</p><p>For buyers, increased months of supply can mean more homes to choose from, less bidding pressure, and more favorable contract terms. For sellers, especially in markets with rising supply, it underscores the importance of competitive pricing and home presentation to stand out. Realtors play a critical role in guiding buyers and sellers through these shifts with expert insight and strategy, HGAR officials state.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/06/2025_05_Westchester_County-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1663" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/2025_05_Westchester_County-1.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/2025_05_Westchester_County-1.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/2025_05_Westchester_County-1.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/06/2025_05_Westchester_County-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Home prices in the Bronx continued to climb, up more than 10% to a median of $667,000. While closed sales declined 17%, a surge in new listings (+18%) and growing inventory (now at 7.5 months of supply for all property types) means buyers have more homes to choose from. Sellers should still expect demand, especially for well-priced homes, but may face more competition from neighboring listings.</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>Westchester remains the region’s most competitive market. The median single-family price reached $999,000, up 2%. Closed sales rose 7.4%, showing buyers are still motivated despite higher prices. However, closed sales for condos and co-ops declined even as their prices increased. Sellers are in a strong position, especially those with homes in move-in condition, but buyers will need to act fast and come prepared.</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Putnam saw home prices rise to $595,000 (+4.6%), but sales dropped by 18%. Condo prices fell by nearly 15%, with sales plunging by nearly 60%. The upside for buyers is greater choice, inventory has more than doubled. Sellers should be flexible with pricing and expect a longer time on the market.</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Rockland saw a slight dip in single-family prices (down 4% to $750,000), while condo and co-op prices dropped 5% and 36% respectively. Yet, condo sales jumped 33% and co-op sales surged 50%. With inventory rising by over 40%, buyers are seeing more opportunities and slightly less competition.</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>Orange County continues to attract buyers looking for value. Single-family prices remained steady at $450,000, and sales rose by 2%. Condo prices rose 2%, though sales dropped nearly 55%. Co-op sales dipped sharply, but prices climbed by 57%. This affordability is attracting first-time and mid-range buyers, making it a prime area for sellers to list.</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>In Sullivan, the median price for single-family homes climbed 7% to $342,500, while sales slipped slightly (-6.5%). This market, popular for second homes, remains sensitive to interest rates. Buyers may find opportunities to negotiate, while well-maintained homes continue to draw interest from seasonal and investment buyers.</p><h3 id="market-observations">Market Observations</h3><p>Across the board, the May 2025 data shows that while inventory is starting to improve in some areas, prices remain elevated due to continued demand. Buyers should secure financing early and work closely with experienced Realtors to navigate the market and find the right opportunities. Sellers, meanwhile, should take advantage of strong pricing trends but ensure homes are well-prepared and competitively priced to stand out.</p><p>“Buyers are adapting to higher interest rates by looking at more affordable markets and property types,” HGAR’s Fernandez added. “Meanwhile, sellers are still benefiting from solid price growth. This market rewards preparation and local expertise, our Realtors are ready to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.”</p><p>The full May 2025 housing report, including interactive charts and local data, is available at <a href="https://hgar.com/news-stats/market-stats" rel="noreferrer">Market Data | Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS®</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters across New York City returned to the polls on Tuesday, June 24, to cast ballots in the 2025 Democratic primary elections, setting the stage for one of the most consequential general elections in recent memory. Key citywide and borough-level races saw both expected results and notable shifts, with significant implications for public policy and the real estate industry. </p><h3 id="mayoral-primary-a-shift-toward-progressives">Mayoral Primary: A Shift Toward Progressives</h3><p>In the highly anticipated mayoral race, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a progressive from Queens, leads the Democratic field after the first round of vote tabulation. With 93% of votes counted, Mamdani held 43.5% compared to former Governor Andrew Cuomo’s 36.4%.<br>While Cuomo’s campaign was supported by high-profile endorsements and well-funded donors, Mamdani benefited from a growing grassroots movement, particularly among younger voters. His platform emphasized housing justice, tenant protections, and investment in social infrastructure.</p><p>Should Mamdani maintain his lead through the final ranked-choice tally, he would become the Democratic nominee in a city where Democrats hold a significant voter registration advantage. At press time, while Cuomo conceded the primary contest, he had not ruled out running as an independent in the November election.</p><h3 id="what-this-could-mean-for-realtors">What This Could Mean for Realtors?</h3><p>A Mamdani candidacy and potential mayoralty could signal a policy environment more focused on tenant protections, rent regulations and public housing expansion. For Realtors, this may bring increased scrutiny of private property transactions, calls for new development requirements and broader zoning or land use changes.</p><p>At the same time, citywide discussions around housing supply, affordability, and sustainability are likely to remain front and center. HGAR’s Government Affairs team will continue to engage decision-makers and advocate for balanced solutions that support both housing access and property rights.</p><h3 id="all-eyes-on-the-boroughs">All Eyes on the Boroughs</h3><p>Beyond the mayoral race, several key borough-level primaries shaped the political landscape heading into the general election:</p><p><strong>Bronx</strong>: Incumbent Borough President Vanessa Gibson secured re-election over Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. with 68.5% of the vote. Gibson has supported affordable housing creation and public-private development partnerships.</p><p><strong>Manhattan</strong>: State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal appears to have defeated Council Member Keith Powers in the race for Manhattan Borough President. Hoylman-Sigal has focused on zoning equity, tenant protections and climate resiliency.</p><p><strong>Brooklyn</strong>: Borough President Antonio Reynoso defeated challenger Khari Edwards. Reynoso has been vocal about reforming land use practices, expanding affordable housing and advancing public health planning.</p><p><strong>Queens</strong>: Borough President Donovan Richards ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. He has championed resiliency planning and transit-oriented development across the borough.</p><p><strong>Staten Island</strong>: Republican incumbent Borough President Michael Colombo also ran unopposed and is expected to remain a leading voice for infrastructure investment and low-density neighborhood protections.</p><p><strong>Citywide</strong>: Public Advocate Jumaane Williams won the Democratic primary decisively and will seek re-election in November. Williams has consistently advocated for tenant protections, housing affordability and police reform.</p><p><strong>Comptroller</strong>: Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine secured the Democratic nomination for New York City Comptroller. Levine brings experience in health equity and housing finance, areas that intersect directly with city development and infrastructure investment.</p><h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next-advocacy-and-civic-engagement">What’s Next: Advocacy and Civic Engagement</h3><p>With the primary season nearly behind us, attention now turns to the General Election this November, where voters will decide who will lead New York City through a pivotal period of recovery, growth and housing transformation.</p><p>For Realtors, the decisions made by these leaders on zoning, tax policy, development incentives and rental regulation will directly impact our work and our communities. That’s why it is more important than ever for our industry to remain informed, engaged and involved.</p><h3 id="the-race-isn%E2%80%99t-over-and-your-voice-still-matters">The Race Isn’t Over and Your Voice Still Matters</h3><p>While the primaries have set the stage, the final outcome will be determined in November. Real estate professionals have a stake in the decisions that shape housing, development, taxation and property rights across New York City.</p><p>Staying informed, understanding the issues, and making your voice heard at the ballot box is essential. These elections will determine who leads our communities forward—and their decisions will directly affect the real estate industry and the clients we serve.</p><p>Participation matters. Engagement matters. The future of our industry depends on it.</p><p><em>Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Bronx Director of Government Affairs for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[San Diego, San Jose, New York, and Boston also saw affordability ratios well above 60%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—In today's major housing markets, affordability isn't just strained, it's nearly extinct. According to a Realtor.com Affordability Report released today (June 25), the typical U.S. household would need to spend 44.6% of their income to afford a median-priced home as of May 2025, well above the recommended 30% threshold. As high mortgage rates and home prices continue to weigh on affordability, only three of the top 50 metros are within financial reach for median-income earners: Pittsburgh, Detroit and St. Louis.</p><p>Realtor.com reports that the typical New York City metro household earning $94,960 a year would have an annual mortgage payment (including taxes and insurance) of $63,531 or $5,294 a month and therefore would be required to spend 66.9% of its income to afford the median-priced home of $795,000.</p><blockquote>“Earnings have risen, but homebuying costs have risen faster, which means that adhering to affordability guidelines can feel challenging if not impossible in many housing markets across the country,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com. “While a few Midwestern markets still offer a path to homeownership for the median-income household who can make a 20% down payment, in most large metros, the dream of owning a home remains out of financial reach without significant changes to either housing supply or interest rates.”</blockquote><h3 id="only-three-metros-pass-the-affordability-test">Only Three Metros Pass the Affordability Test</h3><p>Using a standard 20% down payment and May's average mortgage rate of 6.82%, just three major metros allow median-income earners to purchase a median-priced home without exceeding 30% of their income: Pittsburgh, Detroit and St. Louis.</p><p>These metros remain attractive to both buyers and investors due to their relatively low home prices, but sustained demand for low-priced homes threatens to erode affordability even in these strongholds.</p><p>“Detroit has always stood out for its affordability, and even with home prices rising, it remains one of the last major markets where median-income buyers still have a real shot at homeownership,” said Anthony Djon, founder of Anthony Djon Luxury Real Estate. “That said, demand is picking up fast – especially in the lower price points. First-time buyers are moving with urgency because they know the window to buy affordably is narrowing.”</p><h3 id="the-coasts-are-out-of-reach">The Coasts are Out of Reach</h3><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, the share of income required to afford a home in California's largest metros far exceeds the national norm. The story of California's lack of affordability isn't new, though the degree to which it is unaffordable may still come as a surprise. As of May 2025, the typical home in Los Angeles requires more than 104% of the area's median income, meaning the average household would be unable to cover annual housing costs, even with zero spending on anything else. Other metros, including San Diego, San Jose, New York, and Boston also saw affordability ratios well above 60%.</p><p>That being said, perhaps it doesn't come as a surprise that 51.0% of households in the Los Angeles area are renters, and just 49.0% of households own their own homes, compared to a homeownership rate of 65.1% nationally.</p><h3 id="what-will-make-america-affordable-again">What Will Make America Affordable Again?</h3><p>There are a couple of pathways to making housing more affordable; raise incomes or lower housing costs, according to Realtor.com. While higher wages could help, big pay increases that are widespread can also boost housing demand, pushing home costs higher. Lower housing costs can be achieved, either by bringing down mortgage rates or home prices. Mortgage rates are not expected to move significantly from where they currently sit and recent economic uncertainty makes it harder to predict the mortgage rate path. So, what can be done?</p><p>Build more affordable homes. Home prices remain stubbornly high in markets that are in demand but face a growing home supply gap. In contrast, home prices have eased in many markets that have seen significant new construction activity over the last 5+ years. New home supply and new home construction, especially at affordable price points, can help relieve price pressure in tight housing markets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales increased by 1.8% in May from the prior month and 1.1% year-over-year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales report released earlier today (June 26.)</p><p>All four U.S. regions experienced month-over-month increases—most notably the West. Year-over-year, contract signings rose in the Midwest and South, while they fell in the Northeast and West.</p><p>“Consistent job gains and rising wages are modestly helping the housing market,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Hourly wages are increasing faster than home prices. However, mortgage rate fluctuations are the primary driver of homebuying decisions and impact housing affordability more than wage gains.”</p><blockquote>Regarding regional differences, Yun added, “The Northeast's housing shortage is boosting home prices, with more than a quarter of homes selling above list price. Conversely, more inventory in the South gives home buyers greater negotiation power. Price declines in the South should be considered temporary given the region's strong job creation.”</blockquote><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/06/2025-05-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-06-26-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1501" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/2025-05-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-06-26-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/06/2025-05-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-06-26-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="may-2025-regional-snapshot">May 2025 Regional Snapshot</h2><h3 id="northeast"><br>Northeast</h3><p>2.1% month-over-month increase.<br>0.5% year-over-year decrease.</p><h3 id="midwest">Midwest</h3><p>0.3% month-over-month increase.<br>2.6% year-over-year increase.</p><h3 id="south">South</h3><p>1.0% month-over-month increase.<br>2.0% year-over-year increase.</p><h3 id="west">West</h3><p>6.0% month-over-month increase.<br>1.2% year-over-year decrease.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The NYC Rent Guidelines Board voted to approve rent increases of 3% for one-year leases and 4.5% for two-year leases on rent-stabilized apartments.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As New York City heads into the 2025 general election, a wave of policy conversations is reshaping how elected officials, housing advocates, and the real estate industry are approaching affordability, development, and regulation.</p><p>This past week, two major developments caught the attention of housing stakeholders: </p><p>The NYC Rent Guidelines Board voted to approve rent increases of 3% for one-year leases and 4.5% for two-year leases on rent-stabilized apartments.</p><p>Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary for mayor, elevating a platform centered on rent freezes, public housing investment, and voucher reform.</p><p>Together, these moments signal potential changes ahead—and raise key questions for brokers, landlords, developers, and housing professionals across the five boroughs.</p><h3 id="rent-guidelines-board-vote-a-split-decision-amid-pressure">Rent Guidelines Board Vote: A Split Decision Amid Pressure</h3><p>On June 30, the Rent Guidelines Board finalized adjustments to rent-stabilized lease renewals for the upcoming year:</p><ul>
<li><strong>3% increase for one-year leases</strong></li>
<li><strong>4.5% increase for two-year leases</strong></li>
<li><strong>Effective: Oct. 1, 2025 – Sept. 30, 2026</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The vote—split 5–4—came after weeks of public hearings and pressure from both tenant groups calling for a full rent freeze and landlord advocates citing steep increases in operating costs. While not a freeze, the approved increases are still below inflation and could leave small and midsize landlords with continued margin pressure, especially amid rising insurance, maintenance and financing costs.</p><p>For HGAR members who manage or advise on rent-stabilized properties, this vote reinforces the need to closely track regulatory changes and factor policy risk into pricing, marketing and investment strategies.</p><h3 id="mamdani%E2%80%99s-primary-victory-what-it-signals-and-what-to-watch">Mamdani’s Primary Victory: What It Signals, and What to Watch</h3><p>Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani’s primary win has drawn national attention due to his housing platform, which includes:</p><ul>
<li>Replacing Rent Guidelines Board members to pursue a citywide rent freeze</li>
<li>Creating 200,000 publicly financed affordable housing units over 10 years</li>
<li>Increasing public control over development and expanding voucher-based construction</li>
<li>Supporting broader proposals like free transit and publicly run services, financed by new taxation models</li>
</ul>
<p>While much of this platform would require state-level action, budget reallocation, and regulatory changes, it points to a growing coalition around public investment and expanded renter protections.</p><p>For the real estate industry, key considerations include:</p><ul>
<li>Reduced revenue flexibility in rent-regulated housing</li>
<li>Uncertainty in development timelines and approvals tied to new affordability criteria</li>
<li>Changes to broker fee structures, especially in transactions involving vouchers</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note: Mamdani is not yet mayor, and the general election remains competitive. However, his campaign reflects the broader shift in NYC’s housing debate—one that values housing as a public good and challenges long-standing market assumptions.</p><h3 id="november-ballot-what-the-race-looks-like">November Ballot: What the Race Looks Like</h3><p>As of now, the general election ballot includes:</p><p><strong>Zohran Mamdani (Democrat)</strong> – Running on a platform focused on tenant protections, affordability, and public investment.</p><p><strong>Eric Adams (Independent) </strong>– The incumbent mayor pursuing re-election outside the Democratic primary.</p><p><strong>Jim Walden (Independent)</strong> – Former federal prosecutor focused on anti-corruption and middle-income housing reform.</p><p><strong>Andrew Cuomo (Independent)</strong> – Former governor who remains on the ballot after losing the Democratic primary.</p><p><strong>Curtis Sliwa (Republican) </strong>–Ran unopposed and recently won the Republican primary for mayor.</p><p>Other minor-party candidates, including <strong>Jean Anglade</strong>, <strong>Kyle Gutierrez</strong>, and <strong>Abbey Laurel-Smith</strong>.</p><p>Each candidate offers a distinct view on housing policy, rent regulation, and real estate development. The outcome of this election will shape what housing solutions gain traction—and how regulations evolve at both the city and state level.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-hgar-members">What This Means for HGAR Members</h3><p>As your Government Affairs team continues to monitor these developments, here’s what we’re focused on:</p><p><strong>Policy Impacts:</strong> Assessing how rent regulation changes, voucher policies, and development rules affect brokers, property managers, and owners.</p><p><strong>Member Education:</strong> Helping you navigate legal obligations and market dynamics through briefings, events, and updates.</p><p><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Engaging with city and state officials to ensure the Realtor voice is part of the housing conversation</p><h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3><p>While headlines may focus on personalities, what matters most is the policy environment our members must operate in. Whether it’s rent board decisions, mayoral platforms, or housing legislation, HGAR remains committed to advocating for balance, economic sustainability, and housing access—all while equipping our members with the insight and tools to succeed.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the 2025 New York State Legislative session concluded, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and the New York State Association of Realtors marked a series of key advocacy victories, while bracing for pivotal debates ahead in a consequential 2026 election year. </p><p>Working in close coordination, HGAR and NYSAR championed several Realtor-backed bills that passed both legislative chambers and now await the governor’s signature. Their priorities focused on expanding housing opportunities, improving professional standards and protecting both consumers and the real estate industry from overreach.</p><h3 id="key-legislative-victories">Key Legislative Victories</h3><p>One of the most notable successes was the passage of <strong>Combatting Discrimination in Real Estate Appraisals</strong> (A.6869/S.7320), legislation sponsored by Assemblymember George Alvarez and Senator Brian Kavanagh—both representing districts within HGAR’s footprint—the bill aims to eliminate bias in the appraisal process and reinforce fair housing standards. HGAR elevated this issue during its 2025 Albany Lobby Day, citing its disproportionate impact on historically underserved communities.</p><p>Another major win <strong>Increases Requirements for Obtaining a Broker’s License in New York State </strong>(A.7691/S.5426), raises the education requirement from 120 hours to 150 hours, expands the minimum experience from two to five years, and increases fair housing training from four hours to six hours. Long championed by NYSAR and supported by HGAR, this measure passed with bipartisan support and is seen as a response to industry concerns over broker competency. </p><p>Legislation to curb <strong>Predatory Long-term Listing Agreements</strong> (A.5886-C/S.6361-B) also passed overwhelmingly. The bill prohibits residential listing agreements lasting more than two years unless renewed by mutual agreement. Advocates—including Senator Jamaal Bailey—successfully pushed for a two-year cap after negotiating changes from the original one-year proposal.</p><p>NYSAR also supported <strong>Expands Tax Incentives for Converting Vacant Properties into Housing</strong> (A.6770/S.7285), which passed nearly unanimously. The legislation is expected to boost housing supply and revitalize underused properties across the state.</p><h3 id="defensive-advocacy-blocking-harmful-measures">Defensive Advocacy: Blocking Harmful Measures</h3><p>Equally important was NYSAR and HGAR’s work to stop legislation that could negatively impact the real estate market. Chief among these was the <strong>REST Act </strong>(A.4877-A/S.4659-A), which sought to expand rent control authority to municipalities statewide. Strong Realtor opposition helped prevent it from advancing.</p><p>Proposals to create <strong>Community Housing Funds</strong> backed by new real estate transfer taxes—such as A.331/S.572—were also blocked. NYSAR raised concerns that these measures would increase costs for homebuyers and complicate transactions. Localized versions of similar legislation passed in towns like Chester, Copake, and Orangetown, but broader initiatives failed.</p><p>A scaled-down version of the FAIR Act (A.8427/S.8416) passed, banning deceptive, unfair, and abusive business practices. After pushback from NYSAR and business groups over its original language, the final version reflected more balanced enforcement powers and clearer definitions.</p><p>The legislature also passed A.8888/S.8417, ending the 100-foot subsidy rule for connecting new homes to natural gas. However, its real-world impact is expected to be minimal, as most residential construction under seven stories will shift to electric heating beginning in 2026.</p><h3 id="other-bills-of-note">Other Bills of Note</h3><p>Several bills supported by HGAR and NYSAR gained traction but fell short of passage:</p><p>The First-Time Homebuyer Savings Account (A.5098/S.1157) passed the Senate but not the Assembly.</p><p>A proposed first-time buyer grant program (A.787/S.3150) and a mortgage recording tax exemption (A.5350/S.4488) did not move forward in either chamber.</p><p>A telemarketing reform bill (A.1250/S.6853) passed the Assembly 138-0, but stalled in the Senate.</p><p>Co-op transparency legislation (A.4507/S.1452) and a bill mandating annual sexual harassment prevention training for licensees (A.8092/S.5780) also failed to advance.</p><p>A bill requiring lead paint testing by home sellers (A.1529-A/S.4265-A) passed the Assembly but stalled in the Senate.</p><p>A.8889/S.8421, which would expand the Public Service Commission’s authority to shut off gas services, passed the Senate, but did not move in the Assembly.</p><p>A bill to guarantee the right to home inspections (A.4883/S.5772) did not progress this year.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead-to-2026">Looking Ahead to 2026</h3><p>With the full legislature and governor facing re-election in 2026, HGAR and NYSAR are already preparing for what could be a watershed year for housing policy. The organization's plan is to build on this year’s progress by shaping a forward-looking legislative agenda and deepening engagement with local, state and federal policymakers.</p><p>Realtors are encouraged to stay active in advocacy efforts, participate in upcoming Lobby Days, and join initiatives like HGAR’s Local Political Coordinator Program, which strengthens ties between Realtors and local elected officials.</p><p>Keep an eye out for our Government Affairs Newsletter to keep track of all the hot topics in government affecting our area.</p><p>If you would like to be more involved on a local level, please consider joining our Local Political Coordinator Program.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entrepreneur, speaker, and real estate broker<strong> Kenyatta Jones-Arietta</strong> is set to launch her highly anticipated debut book, “Iron Love: A Guide to Manifesting, Accepting, and Nurturing True Love,” on July 11. Blending memoir and self-help, the book chronicles her journey from a teenage mother and exotic dancer in Detroit to the founder of a successful multi-state real estate firm, devoted wife, and mother of three—now celebrating 25 years of marriage.</p><p>Jones-Arietta has been a contributing columnist to <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> and is the founder of R2M Realty of Nyack.</p><p>More than a love story, Iron Love offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to cultivate deep, intentional relationships—starting with themselves. Through powerful storytelling, spiritual insight, and hard-earned wisdom, Jones-Arietta shares the lessons that helped her break generational cycles, manifest real love, and sustain it through life’s twists and turns.</p><p>The book launch will kick off with a celebration at the historic Nyack Bath House on Friday, July 11, followed by a multi-city East Coast book tour retracing the author’s original honeymoon route—stopping in Virginia Beach, with a quick stop in her hometown of Detroit, before continuing on to Myrtle Beach, Charleston, Savannah, St. Augustine, and Miami. Each event will include book signings, engaging talks, and heartfelt conversations centered on love, resilience, and reclaiming your personal story.</p><blockquote>"Iron Love is not just a story—it’s an invitation to reclaim your worth, rewrite your narrative, and remember that love—real love—is always worth the work," said Jones-Arietta.</blockquote><p>Iron Love will be available in hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audiobook formats through major retailers and independent bookstores. The book is published by Eula Rae Printing &amp; Press, an independent publishing company founded by Jones-Arietta’s daughter, Tiera Rice-Royo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The report noted that in Westchester County, the luxury segment remains particularly strong, with significant buyer activity in the $2-million-and-above category.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RYE BROOK—The real estate market across Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties continued to show signs of resilience and stability through the second quarter, according to the Houlihan Lawrence Second Quarter 2025 Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess Market Report released on July 8.</p><p>The report noted that in Westchester County, the luxury segment remains particularly strong, with significant buyer activity in the $2-million-and-above category and continued interest across most towns. Demand for homes with updated interiors, desirable locations, and proximity to transportation has remained consistent. Despite higher mortgage rates, many buyers remain eager to act quickly when quality properties become available, the report stated.</p><p>According to the report, inventory challenges persist throughout the region, with Westchester facing a particularly tight supply, which has kept prices elevated, especially for homes in well-established communities. Buyers continue to prioritize homes with modern updates, outdoor space, and convenient access to amenities, and well-priced listings continue to attract multiple offers.</p><p>It’s a more mixed picture for the markets in Putnam and Dutchess counties. Homes in the $1-million to $2 -million segment continue to see healthy buyer interest, especially among those seeking more space or a greater value proposition than neighboring counties. However, properties priced above $2 million have experienced longer days on the market, reflecting increased caution as buyers contend with affordability challenges and elevated borrowing costs. Still, homes that combine acreage, privacy, and thoughtful updates continue to draw buyer attention.</p><p>The trend of relocation from New York City and surrounding metro areas remains a significant factor, as more buyers continue to pursue properties outside the city. Hybrid work models have reinforced this trend, bringing new energy to suburban and rural markets alike.</p><blockquote>“Looking forward, we anticipate competitive conditions in Westchester to persist, particularly for updated, well-located properties in desirable towns. In Putnam and Dutchess, homes that are priced appropriately and meet buyer expectations for space and condition will continue to move, though the higher-end market is likely to remain more measured,” said Liz Nunan, President &amp; CEO of Houlihan Lawrence. “With demand for quality homes holding firm and inventory levels tight, the market in these counties is expected to remain active as we move through the second half of 2025,” Nunan added.</blockquote><h3 id="westchester-putnam-dutchess-markets-at-a-glance-q2-2025-vs-q2-2024">Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess Markets at a Glance<br>(Q2 2025 vs Q2 2024)</h3><h3 id="westchester-county"><br>WESTCHESTER COUNTY</h3><p>Homes Sold: Down 0.5%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 11.4%</p><p><strong>New York City Gateway</strong><br>(Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Pelham, and Yonkers)<br>Homes Sold: Up 3%<br>Median Sale Price: 0%</p><p><strong>Lower Westchester</strong><br>(Bronxville, Eastchester, Edgemont, Scarsdale, and Tuckahoe)<br>Homes Sold: Down 3%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 6%</p><p><strong>Rivertowns</strong><br>(Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Hastings, Mount Pleasant, Pleasantville, Tarrytown, Briarcliff Manor, Elmsford, Irvington Ossining, and Pocantico Hills)<br>Homes Sold: Up 1%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 12%</p><p><strong>Greater White Plains</strong><br>(Greenburgh, Valhalla and White Plains)<br>Homes Sold: Down 28%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 14%</p><p><strong>Sound Shore</strong><br>(Blind Brook, Harrison, Mamaroneck, Port Chester, Rye City and Rye Neck<br>Homes Sold: Down 3%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 8%</p><p><strong>Northern Westchester</strong><br>(Bedford, Byram Hills, Chappaqua, Katonah-Lewisboro, North Salem and Somers)<br>Homes Sold: Up 6%<br>Median Sale Price: Down 1%</p><p><strong>Northwest Westchester</strong><br>(Croton-on-Hudson, Hendrick Hudson, Lakeland, Peekskill and Yorktown)<br>Homes Sold: Down 7%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 10%</p><h3 id="putnam-county">PUTNAM COUNTY</h3><p>(Brewster, Carmel, Garrison, Haldane, Lakeland, Mahopac and Putnam Valley)<br>Homes Sold: Up 14%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 9%</p><h3 id="dutchess-county">DUTCHESS COUNTY</h3><p>Homes Sold: Down 8.6%<br>Median Sale Price: Down 0.1%</p><p><strong>Southwest Dutchess</strong><br>(Beacon, East Fishkill, Fishkill, La Grange, Poughkeepsie, City of Poughkeepsie and Wappinger)<br>Homes Sold: Down 15%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 3%</p><p><strong>Southeast Dutchess</strong><br>(Beekman, Dover, Pawling and Union Vale)<br>Homes Sold: Down 30%<br>Median Sale Price: Up 23%</p><p><strong>Northwest Dutchess</strong><br>(Clinton, Hyde Park, Milan, Pleasant Valley, Red Hook and Rhinebeck)<br>Homes Sold: Down 12%<br>Median Sale Price: Down 11%</p><p><strong>Northeast Dutchess</strong><br>(Amenia, Northeast, Pine Plains, Stanford and Washington)<br>Homes Sold: Up 55%<br>Median Sale Price: 0%</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes multiple NAR-championed provisions designed to support homeownership, drive investment in housing supply, and strengthen the real estate economy.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors applauded the U.S. House of Representatives on final passage of the sweeping tax reform legislation that delivers significant victories for homeowners, consumers, real estate professionals, and the broader U.S. economy. The House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 3 by a vote of 218 - 214. The legislation was signed the next day by President Trump.</p><p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes multiple NAR-championed provisions designed to support homeownership, drive investment in housing supply, and strengthen the real estate economy—a sector that accounts for nearly one-fifth of the nation's GDP.</p><blockquote>“For months, Realtors across America have been at the forefront of tax reform, making sure Congress understood that homeownership is not only the cornerstone of the American Dream but a foundation for building wealth and strengthening communities,” said Shannon McGahn, NAR’s executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. “We delivered that message backed by original research, trusted polling data, and the real-world expertise of more than a million Realtors living and working in every ZIP code in America.”</blockquote><p>NAR successfully secured its top five legislative priorities in the final package:</p><ul>
<li>A permanent extension of lower individual tax rates.</li>
<li>A permanent qualified business income deduction (Section 199A).</li>
<li>A temporary (five year) quadrupling of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, beginning in 2025.</li>
<li>Protection for business SALT deductions and 1031 like-kind exchanges.</li>
<li>A permanent extension of the mortgage interest deduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>“These provisions form the backbone of the real estate economy—from supporting first-time and first-generation buyers to strengthening investment in housing supply and protecting existing homeowners,” McGahn said. “This bill reflects what happens when Realtors work together to educate lawmakers and advocate for policies that benefit every American.”</p><p>The legislation also includes a number of other provisions backed by NAR that are positive to the real estate industry.</p><h3 id="additional-real-estate-wins-in-the-tax-package">Additional Real Estate Wins in the Tax Package</h3><ul>
<li>Permanent improvements to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to support affordable housing development.</li>
<li>An increased Child Tax Credit of $2,200, indexed to inflation, helping ease housing costs for families.</li>
<li>A permanent $15-million estate and gift tax threshold, protecting generational wealth transfer.</li>
<li>Restoration of critical business provisions, including full expensing for research and development and bonus depreciation.</li>
<li>Immediate expensing for industrial structures, boosting investment in manufacturing, agriculture, and related industries.</li>
<li>Strengthened Opportunity Zones, renewing targeted incentives to drive economic development, including in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bill also introduces a new “baby bonds” program—a one-time $1,000 government investment for each child born after the law’s enactment. Once matured, these bonds can help future generations build wealth, including saving for a first home.</p><h3 id="realtor-advocacy-made-the-difference">Realtor Advocacy Made the Difference</h3><p>In the final weeks, original polling commissioned by NAR showed overwhelming public support for the bill’s real estate provisions: 92% support tax-free savings accounts for first-time home buyers; 91% support preserving tax incentives like the mortgage interest deduction; 86% support lower individual income tax rates; 83% support the 20% deduction for independent contractors and small businesses and 61% support increasing or eliminating SALT deduction limits.</p><p>“We brought these numbers directly to Capitol Hill and to the White House,” McGahn added. “Lawmakers repeatedly told us they appreciated the research, the clear message, and the voices of Realtors advocating in their communities. This is what happens when our members—backed by facts and united in purpose—speak up.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—Westchester County's office market reached a turning point at mid-year 2025. The market recorded 103,000 square feet of positive net absorption during the second quarter the strongest quarterly total since 2021, according to a report released recently by brokerage firm JLL.</p><p>This performance, following several quarters of occupancy fluctuations, helped reduce total vacancy to 20.8%, a 10.3% decrease from the close of 2024, when total vacancy was 23.2%.</p><p>The report authored by Jared Gordon, Senior Analyst, Research for JLL, noted that leasing activity surged this quarter to over 360,000 square feet, a 45% increase from the first quarter of this year, with renewals representing 57% of executed transactions.</p><p>This pattern reflects occupiers’ cautious approach as they seek flexibility and focus on cost control, favoring existing built-out spaces amid macroeconomic volatility, the JLL report stated. Several major tenants—including M&amp;T Bank, MassMutual, and Jackson Lewis—chose to maintain or moderately expand their footprint through renewals. Class A properties in the White Plains CBD continued to generate significant interest, as seen in PURE Insurance's relocation to 33,402 square feet of space at 1 N Lexington Ave.</p><p>JLL reported that there is no new construction of office space as property owners of outdated and underutilized office buildings continue to look to reposition those properties for other uses.</p><p>Owners of suburban assets outside the CBD are responding to shifting tenant requirements and long-term occupancy trends by pursuing adaptive reuse strategies, which is anticipated to reduce total inventory over time. Looking ahead, the market is expected to maintain its current trajectory with rents and concessions projected to remain stable. However, asking rents for premium spaces in White Plains will continue to see moderate upward adjustment, the report stated. Broader economic factors, including potential funding headwinds for non-profits and hospital systems, could influence occupier demand, particularly given recent leasing momentum from these sectors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Another important provision in the OBBBA raises the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for taxpayers earning less than $500,000, effective from 2025 to 2029, before reverting to $10,000 thereafter.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 4, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) [see <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text</a>], a sweeping tax reform package that significantly reshapes the U.S. Tax Code, with notable implications for the real estate industry. Passed by the House of Representatives on May 22, 2025, and later amended by the Senate, the OBBBA extends and enhances several provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while introducing new incentives aimed at stimulating investment, development and affordability in real estate. This article provides a comprehensive summary of the key provisions in the OBBBA that directly relate to and benefit the real estate sector.</p><h3 id="nar-advocates-for-major-real-estate-provisions">NAR Advocates for Major Real Estate Provisions</h3><p>The National Association of Realtors remained actively involved in negotiating with the White House to have important provisions included in the OBBBA [see <a href="http://bit.ly/44SSyOO">http://bit.ly/44SSyOO</a>]. According to NAR, it “remained at the negotiating table through the final hours.” NAR Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer Shannon McGahn stated that they “were invited to the White House just days before the final (Senate) vote to continue advocating for our members and consumers.” McGahn further stated that “The administration and Congress respect the voice of our members and the roles they play as leaders in their communities. We are an army of advocates living and working in every ZIP code in America with a unique insight into the state of the economy.” Some of the key provisions advocated by NAR were:</p><ul>
<li>A permanent extension of lower individual tax rates.</li>
<li>An enhanced and permanent qualified business income deduction (Section 199A).</li>
<li>A temporary (five-year) quadrupling of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, beginning for 2025.</li>
<li>Protection for business SALT deductions and 1031 like-kind exchanges.</li>
<li>A permanent extension of the mortgage interest deduction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-mortgage-insurance-pmi-deduction-allowed">Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) Deduction Allowed</h3><p>The OBBBA permanently reinstates the deduction for private mortgage insurance (PMI) premiums as qualified residence interest, effective for tax years after Dec. 31, 2025. PMI premiums on acquisition debt for primary or second homes (up to $750,000 mortgage debt) are deductible if taxpayers itemize deductions. The deduction phases out for higher earners, likely starting at $100,000 AGI (exact thresholds to be confirmed by the IRS). This covers PMI premiums from private insurers and federal programs (e.g., FHA, VA, RHS) for mortgages issued on or after Jan. 1, 2007. This deduction directly benefits lower and middle-income homeowners, especially first-time buyers, but does require itemization and is subject to income phase-outs. The IRS will issue further guidance clarifying the requirements for 2026 and future years.</p><h3 id="increased-state-and-local-tax-salt-deduction-cap">Increased State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Cap</h3><p>Another important provision in the OBBBA raises the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for taxpayers earning less than $500,000, effective from 2025 to 2029, before reverting to $10,000 thereafter. This increase benefits homeowners in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California, where property taxes are significant. By allowing larger deductions for state and local taxes, the enhanced SALT provision allows for more affordability for buyers who purchase homes with significant real estate tax burdens, increasing higher demand and price appreciation in these markets.</p><h3 id="enhancements-to-low-income-housing-tax-credit">Enhancements to Low-Income Housing Tax Credit</h3><p>The OBBBA bolsters the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, which supports the construction and preservation of affordable housing. For the period 2026 to 2029, the 9% LIHTC is restored to its 2021 level with a 12.5% allocation increase. For the 4% LIHTC, the bond-financing threshold for projects is lowered from 50% to 25% for bonds issued between 2025 and 2030. Additionally, Tribal and rural areas are designated as Difficult Development Areas, increasing credit eligibility. These changes are expected to expand the supply of affordable housing in DDAs, addressing a critical need in the U.S. housing market, particularly for lower-income renters.</p><h3 id="permanent-increase-in-qualified-business-income-deduction">Permanent Increase in Qualified Business Income Deduction</h3><p>The OBBBA also makes permanent the Section 199A deduction for qualified business income (QBI), which was originally introduced in the TCJA and set to expire after 2025. This deduction, available to pass-through entities such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships, has been increased from 20% to 23%, reducing the effective federal tax rate to as low as 28.49%. For real estate professionals, particularly those operating through real estate investment trusts (REITs) or pass-through entities, this enhanced deduction provides significant tax savings, boosting after-tax income and encouraging further investment in both residential and commercial properties.</p><p>The legislation also expands the QBI deduction to include dividends from electing business development companies, treated as regulated investment companies, further broadening its applicability. Additionally, the OBBBA replaces the complex phase-out rules for W-2 wages, capital investment, and specified service trade or business (SSTB) limitations with a simplified two-step framework for taxpayers above certain income thresholds, making the deduction more accessible.</p><h3 id="increased-section-179-expensing-limits">Increased Section 179 Expensing Limits</h3><p>The OBBBA raises the maximum amount taxpayers can expense under IRC Section 179 from $1.25 million to $2.5 million, with the phase-out threshold increased from $3.13 million to $4 million, both indexed for inflation starting in 2026. This provision allows real estate developers and investors to deduct the cost of qualifying tangible personal property and certain real property improvements in the year they are placed in service, up to these higher limits. This change is expected to stimulate development activity by reducing the tax burden on capital-intensive projects, such as renovations and equipment purchases for commercial properties.</p><h3 id="permanent-extension-of-opportunity-zones">Permanent Extension of Opportunity Zones</h3><p>The OBBBA also extends and enhances the Qualified Opportunity Zone program, originally set to expire, by launching a second round from 2027 to 2033. The QOZ Program incentivizes investment in economically distressed areas by offering tax deferrals and potential exclusions on capital gains. Key enhancements include a narrower definition of low-income communities, a requirement that at least 33% of opportunity zones be rural, and a 30% step-up in basis for rural Qualified Opportunity Zone Funds after five years. These changes make the program more attractive for real estate investors focusing on underserved areas, potentially driving development in rural and low-income urban communities.</p><h3 id="restoration-and-expansion-of-bonus-depreciation">Restoration and Expansion of Bonus Depreciation</h3><p>One of the most significant provisions for real estate investors is the reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation under Internal Revenue Code Section 168(k). Under prior law, bonus depreciation was set to phase down to 40% in 2025 and expire entirely by 2027. The OBBBA restores full expensing for qualified property, such as equipment, machinery, and certain building improvements, acquired and placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2030. This allows real estate developers to immediately deduct the full cost of qualifying renovations and property improvements, significantly improving cash flow and incentivizing capital investment in commercial and residential real estate projects.</p><p>Additionally, the OBBBA introduces a new elective 100% depreciation allowance for “Qualified Production Property” under IRC Section 168(n). QPP includes non-residential real property used in manufacturing, production or refining of tangible personal property in the U.S., provided construction begins between Jan. 20, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, and the property is placed in service by Dec. 31, 2032. This provision is particularly beneficial for investors in logistics, warehousing and industrial facilities, as it creates a powerful tax advantage for developing or upgrading such properties.</p><h3 id="preservation-of-key-real-estate-provisions">Preservation of Key Real Estate Provisions</h3><p>The OBBBA also preserves several longstanding provisions that have been critical to the real estate industry. The following are some of the key provisions:</p><ul>
<li>IRC Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchanges: These allow investors to defer capital gains taxes on the exchange of similar properties, promoting reinvestment and property improvements.</li>
<li>Deferred Tax Treatment of Mortgage Servicing Rights: This maintains tax advantages for mortgage servicers, supporting liquidity in the housing market.</li>
<li>EBITDA-Based Interest Deduction: The OBBBA reinstates the use of EBITDA (rather than EBIT) for calculating adjusted taxable income under Section 163(j) for the period 2025 through 2028, potentially increasing allowable business interest deductions for real estate activities. This may reduce the need for real estate businesses to make costly elections under Section 163(j)(7)(A)(ii).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-deductions-for-homebuyers-and-consumers">New Deductions for Homebuyers and Consumers</h3><p>The OBBBA introduces temporary deductions that will serve to support homeownership and consumer spending. Consumers and homebuyers are now allowed a deduction of up to $10,000 annually for interest on auto loans for vehicles assembled in the U.S (covering the period from 2025 through 2028). This may indirectly stimulate housing demand by easing financial pressures on households. Additionally, the OBBBA allows for a deduction for qualified tip income (up to $25,000) and overtime pay (up to $12,500) for the period covering 2025 through 2028. Again, these deductions are likely to benefit service industry workers who may be prospective homebuyers.</p><h3 id="implications-for-the-real-estate-industry">Implications for the Real Estate Industry</h3><p>The OBBBA’s provisions collectively create a favorable environment for real estate investors, developers and professionals. The restoration of 100% bonus depreciation and the introduction of QPP deductions incentivize capital investment in commercial and industrial properties, while the enhanced QBI deduction and increased Section 179 limits reduce tax liabilities for pass-through entities and developers. The extension of Qualified Opportunity Zones and LIHTC enhancements promote development in underserved areas, addressing both economic and housing needs. The increased SALT deduction, though temporary, will support real estate demand and ultimately benefit buyers and property values.</p><h3 id="obbba-positive-for-the-real-estate-industry">OBBBA: Positive for the Real Estate Industry</h3><p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents a significant win for the real estate industry, offering several tax incentives that enhance cash flow, reduce tax burdens and stimulate investment. By making permanent and expanding key provisions like the QBI deduction, bonus depreciation, and Qualified Opportunity Zones, while preserving critical mechanisms like 1031 exchanges, the OBBBA provides certainty and opportunities for growth.</p><p>As always, real estate professionals and consumers should consult with their legal and tax advisors to optimize strategies around these provisions, particularly given the immediate or retroactive effect of many changes starting in 2025. As the industry navigates this new tax landscape, the OBBBA is poised to drive significant activity in commercial, industrial and affordable housing sectors, reinforcing the real estate industry’s role as a cornerstone of economic growth.</p><p><em>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq., is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Due to stubbornly high mortgage rates, a greater share of international home buyers paid cash—47% compared to 28% among all buyers.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Foreign buyers purchased $56 billion worth of U.S. existing homes from April 2024 through March 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors 2025 International Transactions in U.S. Residential Real Estate report released today (July 14).</p><p>This was a 33.2% increase from the previous 12-month period. International buyers purchased 78,100 properties, up 44% from the prior year and the first year-over-year increase since 2017. The median purchase price for foreign buyers of $494,400 was a record high, NAR reported.</p><p>New York State ranked fourth among the top U.S. destinations among foreign buyers during that period at 7%.</p><blockquote>“International interest in buying U.S. real estate increased following the global economic recovery from several years of pandemic-related disruptions. However, elevated home prices and interest rates continue to dampen overall potential sales activity and remain well below pre-pandemic levels,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Boosted by a significant increase in the state’s housing inventory, Florida remained the top destination for foreign home buyers, extending a streak of at least 15 years. To some degree, due to stubbornly high mortgage rates, a greater share of international home buyers paid cash—47% compared to 28% among all buyers—and they were more likely to purchase homes priced in the upper end of the market. Foreign buyers are drawn to investing in American real estate, in part, by our country’s strong protection of private property rights.”</blockquote><p>NAR's 2025 International Transactions in U.S. Residential Real Estate report surveyed members about transactions with international clients who purchased and sold U.S. residential property from April 2024 through March 2025 – capturing data before new tariffs were announced in April 2025. This report equips real estate professionals with valuable information that helps them serve their clients and get to their next transaction.</p><p>Foreign buyers who resided in the U.S. as recent immigrants or who were holding visas that allowed them to live in the U.S. purchased 43,700 homes (56% of all foreign purchases) with a total dollar volume of $26.9 billion. Foreign buyers who lived abroad purchased 34,400 homes (44% of all foreign purchases) with a total dollar volume of $29.1 billion.</p><h3 id="existing-home-purchases-by-foreign-buyers">Existing-Home Purchases by Foreign Buyers</h3><ul>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The National Association of Realtors published the NAR Market Statistics Dashboard today. The Dashboard is a member-exclusive tool that provides NAR members with unparalleled local housing data that enhances their ability to help their clients buy and sell homes.</p><blockquote>“The new Dashboard is a tool that enables NAR members to stay ahead of the market and better serve their clients. Using exclusive NAR data, the Dashboard is a one-stop shop that equips members with insights into shifts in affordability, demand, and the economy. This allows agents who are Realtors® to advocate on behalf of their clients with confidence and achieve better outcomes," said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</blockquote><p>The interactive Market Statistics Dashboard is updated monthly and provides NAR members with metro data on:</p><ul>
<li>Housing affordability</li>
<li>Sales and listing trends</li>
<li>Home pricing changes</li>
<li>Economic indicators</li>
<li>Homeownership and demographic insights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dashboard also includes forward-looking analysis on how many households could qualify to buy a median-priced home if mortgage rates fall to 6%. This enables members to better guide clients through the homebuying and selling process.</p><p>The analysis shows that even a modest decline in mortgage rates can improve affordability. If mortgage rates fall to 6%, NAR expects that an additional 5.5 million households in America, including 1.6 million renters, will have the income needed to buy a median-priced home. Approximately 10% of the additional households would be expected to buy over the next 12 to 18 months if rates decline.</p><p>These affordability gains are expected to support stronger housing activity. NAR's latest forecast projects a:</p><ul>
<li>3% increase in home sales in 2025 and 14% increase in 2026</li>
<li>1% rise in home prices in 2025 and 4% rise in 2026</li>
<li>6.7% average for the 30-year mortgage rate in 2025 and a 6.0% average in 2026</li>
<li>Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, Cleveland, and Kansas City are expected to see the strongest boost in home sales activity if rates decline to 6%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Lawrence Yun, NAR Chief Economist, will demonstrate the new NAR Market Statistics Dashboard and share his midyear forecast on the economy and housing market during the Forecast Summit webinar on July 16, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. Click here to register (<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/events/nar-real-estate-forecast-summit">https://www.nar.realtor/events/nar-real-estate-forecast-summit</a>)</p><p>Members can access the Market Statistics Dashboard here (<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/metro-market-statistics">https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/metro-market-statistics</a>).

    <description><![CDATA[Notably, big cities New York (71.7%), Boston (72%), and Chicago (72.6%) joined the top 10 metros with the highest out-of-market search rates.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—With affordability still out of reach for many, a new report from Realtor.com released today found 58.9% of online home shoppers in the 100 largest U.S. metros looked outside their current metro in the second quarter of 2025, up from 48.1% in 2019, as buyers seek homes that better fit their budgets, job flexibility, and lifestyle needs.</p><blockquote>“Affordability remains a primary driver of home searches, but evolving workplace policies, job opportunities and shifting local conditions also play a role. As regional housing trends diverge, home shoppers tapped the brakes compared to a year ago, but accelerated their searches elsewhere compared to 2019, across the 100 largest metros with sizable variation across markets,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com. “Despite the year-over-year step back, Americans continue to take a broader view of where they can live, often looking beyond their current metro areas in hopes of stretching their dollar and improving their lifestyle.”</blockquote><p>Big cities dominated the top ten metros as current residents overwhelmingly searched out of their markets driven by affordability challenges. San Jose, CA, had the highest share of outbound search traffic, with 93.7% of shoppers looking at listings elsewhere. More than one-third of that activity was aimed outside California altogether.</p><p>Washington, D.C. (86.4%), Seattle (80.5%), and Salt Lake City (77%) also topped the list of metros with the most local residents eyeing an out of metro move. Notably, big cities New York (71.7%), Boston (72%), and Chicago (72.6%) joined the top 10 metros with the highest out-of-market search rates—reflecting a combination of rising home prices and growing unemployment.</p><h3 id="pandemic-era-boomtowns-losing-steam-as-affordability-wanes">Pandemic-Era Boomtowns Losing Steam as Affordability Wanes</h3><p>Several cities which saw a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic are now experiencing rising outbound interest as affordability erodes and return-to-office mandates take hold.</p><p>In Phoenix, the share of out-of-market views rose 28.5 percentage points over the past six years. Spokane, WA, and Fresno, CA saw similar jumps of 27.7 and 21.3 points, respectively. McAllen, TX. which once attracted pandemic-era buyers with its low cost of living, is now seeing an exodus as home prices rise and buyers redirect their attention to larger, higher-wage, high employment markets such as Austin and San Antonio.</p><h3 id="high-home-prices-and-rising-unemployment-drive-out-of-metro-searches">High Home Prices and Rising Unemployment<br>Drive Out of Metro Searches</h3><p>Metros with the biggest increases in outbound search activity often experienced large jumps in home prices and rising unemployment over the past six years. Nine of the top ten metros with the biggest loss in popularity also saw prices jump more than 27% since 2019, with Boston seeing home prices climb 42.5% and Spokane, WA, seeing home prices climb 47.9%. Chicago, the slowest growth market, saw prices grow 12.2%. The New York Metro region saw home prices rise more than 32% during that six-year time period.</p><h3 id="relative-affordability-is-the-trend-for-cities-holding-on-to-their-residents">Relative Affordability is the Trend for Cities Holding on to Their Residents</h3><p>Even as many metros lose shoppers to other regions, a handful are seeing increased loyalty from local buyers. San Francisco stands out with a decline in outbound search activity, from 68.9% in 2019 to 62.9% this year.

    <description><![CDATA[The Bronx continues to have the lowest homeownership rate in New York City, at just 20%.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month, the <em>Bronx Times </em>published a powerful feature titled “From Renters to Owners: Bronx First-Time Buyers Navigate a Tough Market,” that highlighted the challenges and opportunities facing prospective homeowners in the Bronx. HGAR was proud to help facilitate this story by connecting the journalist with local Realtor expertise and sharing timely market data from the National Association of Realtors. </p><p>I had the opportunity to coordinate the interview with HGAR member <strong>Gregory Tsougranis</strong>, a dedicated real estate professional who works closely with buyers and sellers across the Bronx and New York City. His insight provided a crucial perspective on what first-time buyers are facing and how Realtors can guide them through it.</p><h3 id="the-bronx-nyc%E2%80%99s-toughest-path-to-ownership">The Bronx: NYC’s Toughest Path to Ownership</h3><p>The Bronx continues to have the lowest homeownership rate in New York City, at just 20%. Buyers, especially first-timers, must navigate a market defined by limited housing inventory, rising prices and high interest rates. This combination makes it difficult for long-term renters to transition into ownership, even when they’re financially prepared and motivated to do so.</p><p>Despite these hurdles, the <em>Bronx Times</em> article highlights the success stories of Bronx residents who’ve managed to achieve homeownership with the right support. Gregory Tsougranis explained how experienced Realtors can play a critical role in helping buyers make smart, confident decisions in a highly competitive market.</p><blockquote>“The average buyer has been on Zillow for months. What they need now is a professional who understands the Bronx market and can guide them,” he told the Bronx Times.</blockquote><h3 id="realtor-advocacy-and-the-policy-connection">Realtor Advocacy and the Policy Connection</h3><p>These challenges in the marketplace are exactly why HGAR continues to advocate for common-sense housing policy at all levels of government. Whether through first-time homebuyer assistance programs, efforts to expand housing supply or proposals to reduce regulatory burdens, our legislative priorities are grounded in what our members and their clients experience on the ground every day.</p><p>The <em>Bronx Times</em> article also underscores the importance of Realtor voices in local media. It’s one thing to talk policy in Albany or City Hall, but it’s another to make the case through real stories of families trying to buy their first home. That’s where our advocacy becomes real and tangible.</p><h3 id="strengthening-our-voice">Strengthening Our Voice</h3><p>We’ll continue to use NAR housing data, member expertise, and direct engagement with elected officials to advance policies that support homeownership and strengthen communities. This <em>Bronx Times</em> feature is a great example of how HGAR is shaping the public narrative and bringing Realtor voices to the forefront of the housing conversation.</p><p>Read the full article here:<br><a href="https://www.bxtimes.com/from-renters-to-owners-bronx-first-time-buyers-navigate-a-tough-market/" rel="noreferrer">From Renters to Owners: Bronx First-Time Buyers Navigate a Tough Market</a></p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The Charter Review Commission is also recommending the creation of an independent Land Use Appeals Board. This board would offer an alternative avenue to challenge zoning and planning decisions, creating a formal process for appeals outside of the judicial system.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a significant move with far-reaching implications for New York City’s housing and planning landscape, the New York City Charter Review Commission has approved a package of proposals for inclusion on the November 2025 ballot. These proposals aim to address key barriers to affordable housing development, modernize outdated land use processes, and increase civic participation in local elections. </p><p>For those in the real estate industry—especially Realtors, developers, housing advocates, and policy professionals—these changes could have a profound impact on project delivery, regulatory timelines and the future of housing in New York City.</p><h3 id="fast-tracking-affordable-housing">Fast-Tracking Affordable Housing</h3><p>One of the most impactful proposals would enable the city to streamline the approval process for deeply affordable and supportive housing projects. The current land use approval process can take years, thus delaying vital housing initiatives and increasing development costs. This proposal would establish a faster, more predictable pathway for these projects, helping to address the city’s affordability crisis.</p><h3 id="simplified-review-for-modest-housing-projects">Simplified Review for Modest Housing Projects</h3><p>Another proposal aims to simplify the public review process for modest or lower-density housing developments. Under this change, smaller-scale projects—often delayed by the same lengthy ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure) process as larger developments—would benefit from an expedited review process. This would not only save time, but also encourage more infill and “missing middle” housing in appropriate areas.</p><h3 id="land-use-appeals-board">Land Use Appeals Board</h3><p>The Charter Review Commission is also recommending the creation of an independent Land Use Appeals Board. This board would offer an alternative avenue to challenge zoning and planning decisions, creating a formal process for appeals outside of the judicial system. For property owners and developers, this could add a valuable layer of accountability and efficiency.</p><h3 id="modernizing-the-city-map">Modernizing the City Map</h3><p>Currently, the city’s official map is outdated and difficult to amend, creating obstacles for planning and infrastructure development. A proposed reform would modernize the City Map process, allowing for more routine and flexible updates that better reflect real-world land use, street conditions, and property lines—an important change for those involved in development and urban infrastructure.</p><h3 id="transitioning-to-even-year-elections">Transitioning to Even-Year Elections</h3><p>Lastly, the commission has proposed aligning local elections with state and federal election cycles. Moving to even-numbered years is expected to significantly increase voter turnout, ensuring broader public participation in decisions that shape city government and land use policy.</p><h3 id="what-it-means-for-realtors">What It Means for Realtors</h3><p>If approved, these reforms could accelerate the pace of housing development, improve land use decision-making, and increase civic engagement—all of which are crucial to creating a more stable, efficient housing market. Realtors who work in New York City or represent clients with interests there should closely monitor the progress of these proposals and prepare for their potential impact.</p><p>At the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, we will continue to keep our members informed and engaged as we approach the November 2025 election. These policy shifts have the potential to create both opportunities and challenges in our market—and your awareness and advocacy will make a difference.</p><h3 id="key-election-dates-for-new-york-city-%E2%80%93-2025">Key Election Dates for New York City – 2025:</h3><p><br><strong>Early Voting Begins:</strong> Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025</p><p><strong>Early Voting Ends: </strong>Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025</p><p><strong>Election Day: Tuesday,</strong> Nov. 4, 2025</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates from HGAR Government Affairs—and be sure to vote this November.</p><p>Your voice matters—make a plan to vote!</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Yun predicted that existing home sales would rise approximately 3% this year, but jump 14% higher in 2025.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun believes that with the prospect of multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, interest rates next year will drop down to approximately 6%, which will finally fuel a recovery in home sales.</p><p>Yun, during NAR’s virtual Mid-Year Real Estate and Economic Outlook on July 16, said that at the moment while there are some signs of potential improvement, current data indicates a home sales recovery is still a ways off.</p><p>Yun related that home sales volume continues to be slow and is in fact below pre-COVID levels for the third consecutive year, despite the fact that there are 7 million more jobs than during the pandemic. He also stated that price appreciation has started to slow.</p><p>He admitted that the depressed sales volume for the first six months of 2025 was disappointing. The elevated mortgage interest rates at nearly 7% have caused a sharp drop in demand and therefore scuttled his earlier prediction of a stronger spring sales market.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/07/page-14-copy.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/page-14-copy.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/page-14-copy.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/page-14-copy.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/07/page-14-copy.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>“So far, it has been a bummer. We have not seen a recovery at the moment,” Yun said. However, he noted that there is “a little light at the end of the tunnel” in the form of increased mortgage applications. He noted that recently home mortgage applications have risen between 15% and more than 20% over last year’s totals.</blockquote><p>Yun said that Realtors can expect anywhere from six to eight rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the next 12 months. He also stated that a majority of analysts are betting that the Fed will reduce rates twice in 2025.</p><p>One of the more enlightening components of Yun’s presentation was the significant potential demand if current mortgage rates fall to 6%, which he believes will occur sometime in 2026. He predicts rates will average around 6.7% in 2025.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/07/page-15-copy.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/page-15-copy.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/page-15-copy.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/page-15-copy.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/07/page-15-copy.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If rates do indeed fall to 6%, Yun said that another 5.5 million households could therefore qualify for the average mortgage. Based on 10% of those households pursuing the purchase of a home, that would add a potential 550,000 transactions.</p><p>Yun predicted that existing home sales would rise approximately 3% this year, but jump 14% higher in 2025. The national existing home sales price will rise by just 1% this year, but rebound to be 4% higher in 2026. He expects new home sales to increase 5% this year and again at the same level in 2026. Job gains will rise 1.6 million in 2025 and by 2 million in 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS recently released its latest regional housing market report, which showed a slight dip in closed sales activity last month while inventory challenges continue to shape conditions across the New York metro area.</p><p>In June, median sales prices continued their upward trend for all property types—which include single-family homes, condominiums, and co-ops—rising 6.1% year-over-year to $700,000. The median sales price for single-family homes climbed to $775,000, marking a 6.2% gain. Condominiums saw a 5.1% increase, raising the median to $515,000, while co-op prices rose 7.0% to reach a median of $300,000.</p><p>Meanwhile, closed sales for all properties edged down 6.0% year-over-year to 3,972 transactions, with single-family home closings down 4.6% to 2,981, condo closings down 12.9% to 501, and co-op closings easing 6.7% to 490 units.</p><p>Inventory remained tight across the region, with the total number of homes for sale declining 5.0% compared to June 2024, leaving 15,582 active listings. The month’s supply of inventory dipped slightly to 3.9 months, underscoring the competitive environment for buyers. New listings posted a modest year-over-year decrease of 1.5%, totaling 6,439 for the month.</p><blockquote>“While buyer interest remains strong, the market continues to be defined by limited inventory and affordability pressures,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect steady demand and gradual price growth to persist as supply continues to lag behind.”</blockquote><p>Pending sales activity offered some positive momentum for future closings, with a notable 8.2% annual increase to 4,848 contracts signed in June. However, with fewer new listings coming to market, inventory constraints are likely to continue through the summer.</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>OneKey MLS serves more than 42,000 real estate professionals throughout the New York metropolitan area.

    <description><![CDATA[Market dynamics continue to reflect high competition at the entry level and slower movement in the luxury tier.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors released its June 2025 housing report today, revealing continued price growth and evolving inventory conditions across the Hudson Valley and surrounding areas. Based on data from OneKey MLS, the report shows that while some areas are seeing increased options for buyers, prices remain high—especially in Westchester, which has crossed a historic threshold with the single-family median price climbing to the $1.2-million threshold.</p><blockquote>“The median price of a single-family home in Westchester surpassed $1 million for the first time in 2025, reaching $1.2 million, up 14%, underscoring the region’s continued appeal despite affordability concerns,” said Lynda Fernandez, CEO of HGAR. “We’re also seeing double-digit price increases in Putnam and the Bronx, while sales activity remains strong in Rockland and Orange counties.”</blockquote><p>She continued, “Inventory is showing modest improvement in some areas, but it’s not keeping pace with demand—especially for move-in ready homes under $500,000. Buyers are shifting strategies, expanding their search radius, and exploring alternative property types. In this evolving market, Realtors are more important than ever in helping consumers adapt and succeed.”</p><p>With 30-year mortgage rates hovering near 6.75% in June, buyers remain rate-sensitive, increasingly exploring townhomes, co-ops, and peripheral markets to stretch their purchasing power, the HGAR report stated. Nationally, pending home sales in May rose 1.8% month-over-month and 1.1% year-over-year, according to NAR. Locally, HGAR’s region reflects similar resilience, with select counties such as Rockland and Orange posting strong sales growth despite affordability challenges.</p><p>Market dynamics continue to reflect high competition at the entry level and slower movement in the luxury tier. Homes priced under $500,000 remain in high demand and are in short supply, leading to multiple offers and quick sales. Higher-priced homes, especially above $1 million in Westchester and Rockland, are seeing longer days on the market and more negotiation room. Inventory trends remain uneven, with some counties experiencing growth, while others still face tight conditions.</p><p>A balanced real estate market typically reflects 6 months to 9 months of inventory—enough supply to meet demand without favoring buyers or sellers. Markets below that threshold, like most of HGAR’s region, continue to lean toward sellers, while areas approaching or exceeding that range, such as the Bronx, offer buyers more leverage and negotiating room.</p><h2 id="county-highlights">County Highlights</h2><h3 id="westchester-county"><br>Westchester County</h3><p>The median price for a single-family home hit $1.2 million (+14%). Closed sales rose nearly 5%, showing that buyers remain engaged despite price pressures. Condo and co-op prices also rose 4% and 5.5% respectively, though sales dipped slightly. Days on the market in Westchester County dropped to just 19 in June, underscoring the continued competitiveness of the market. Inventory is also still constrained, with only 2.7 months of supply, down from last month. Sellers are well-positioned, especially with updated, move-in-ready homes. There were 909 new listings in June, up slightly year-over-year. While Westchester remains a seller’s market, markets like the Bronx with 7.4 months are nearing balance, offering buyers more negotiating power.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/07/2025_06_Westchester_County.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="975" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/2025_06_Westchester_County.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/2025_06_Westchester_County.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/2025_06_Westchester_County.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/07/2025_06_Westchester_County.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Westchester County</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Putnam’s single-family median price jumped to $612,000 (+10%), while closed sales dropped nearly 9%. Condo prices fell slightly (-3.3%), and sales dipped by 12.5%. With 3.6 months of inventory, buyers are gaining more leverage, though demand for move-in-ready homes remains strong.

There were 338 new listings in Rockland, up 10.5%.</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>Orange continues to attract value-driven buyers. The median single-family home price rose to $459,900 (+3.3%). While condo sales declined by 31%, prices remained stable. Inventory sits at 3.8 months. Orange remains a popular choice for first-time buyers and those priced out of neighboring counties. There were 416 new listings in June, and days on the market were up nearly 4% at 28.</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>The median single-family price rose to $351,500 (+2.6%), while closed sales fell nearly 8%.

Bronx home prices climbed to $680,000, +8%. Closed sales declined by 15%, but new listings rose 12%, indicating a growing supply. Months of inventory for co-ops and condos alone rose to 9 months, up 1.1% year-over-year. There were only 134 new listings in The Bronx, down 11%.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2><p><br>While prices remain strong, shifts in inventory and buyer behavior are creating a more nuanced market. Sellers should focus on presentation and pricing, while buyers can benefit from increased options and potentially more favorable contract terms.</p><p>“Whether you’re buying or selling, it’s no longer just about speed, it’s about strategy,” Fernandez added. “Today’s market requires a more calculated approach. Buyers need to understand which areas offer the best value and be prepared with financing in place, while sellers must price competitively and ensure their homes stand out in a growing pool of listings. Navigating these complexities takes more than luck—it takes local insight, real-time market knowledge, and negotiation expertise. That’s where HGAR Realtors make the difference, helping clients make confident, informed decisions every step of the way.”</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The full June 2025 housing report, including interactive charts and county-level data, is available at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/news-stats/market-stats" rel="noreferrer">www.hgar.com</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Cappelli estimated that with the NYPA project, the total Hamilton Green development cost will be approximately $900 million.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—Construction on the first new commercial office building in Downtown White Plains in nearly four decades—the new headquarters for the New York Power Authority—has begun after a Project Labor Agreement was reached between the building trades and the general contractor for the project.</p><p>Officials with the Westchester Putnam Building and Construction Trades Council and Louis Cappelli, a principal of general contractor LRC Construction of White Plains, confirmed that a PLA had been signed last week on the new NYPA headquarters to be built at the Hamilton Green site being developed by Cappelli Enterprises and RXR. The New York Power Authority will relocate from its current headquarters property at 123 Main St. to its new 16-story headquarters at the former site of the White Plains Mall in mid-2027.</p><p>The PLA comes after months of negotiations with the building trades and after the New York Power Authority acquired the pad site from Cappelli’s LRC Construction and RXR for $30 million in February. Cappelli told <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> that the New York Power Authority project will likely total $330 million to complete.</p><p>Cappelli said that LRC/RXR worked collaboratively on the project design drawings, which are complete. Gensler is the architectural firm on the project and ME is the mechanical engineering firm working on the headquarters project. The building will be approximately 260 feet in height and will total approximately 310,000 square feet.</p><p>The NYPA building and a small residential building totaling 127 units owned by Cappelli/RXR will be constructed simultaneously. Completion of both the NYPA headquarters and the residential building is slated for June 2027 and will complete the Hamilton Green development. Cappelli estimated that with the NYPA project, the total Hamilton Green development cost will be approximately $900 million. The project will feature about 600 housing units and approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space.</p><blockquote>“It (the PLA) was a good opportunity for us to re-engage with the building trades of Westchester. The last PLA we signed was in 2009 for the Ritz Carlton (in White Plains),” Cappelli said. He claimed that although his firm had not agreed to a PLA in more than 15 years, his projects over that span “have predominantly been 50% union trades.”</blockquote><p><em>Construction News</em> reports that Jeff Loughlin, president of the Building &amp; Construction Trades of Westchester &amp; Putnam Counties, Inc., said, “The PLA now in place is a tremendous vote of confidence in union labor by everyone associated with this project—including NYPA, the Cappelli organization and the many officials in the City of White Plains. They recognize the value and the quality construction that union companies bring to a landmark project like the new NYPA headquarters.”</p><p>Cappelli added that his firm has also begun discussions on the massive redevelopment of the Galleria Mall site in Downtown White Plains, which is currently in the approval process. The estimated $2.5-billion project is being proposed by Cappelli Enterprises, Pacific Retail Capital Partners and Aareal Bank. He said that the unions and the development team “are committed to making it (the PLA) happen.”</p><p>In addition to the Hamilton Green and Galleria sites, another potential development project could emerge at the current NYPA headquarters site at 123 Main St. across the street from the Hamilton Green property. NYPA has determined that the building is outdated, but has not decided yet what it plans to do with the property now that it has moved forward with its new corporate headquarters.</p><p>The new NYPA headquarters is likely the first, Class A office building constructed in Downtown White Plains since 10 Bank St. opened in 1989. </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON — Mortgage applications decreased 3.8% from one week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending July 25, 2025.</p><p>The Market Composite Index was released today (July 30.

The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 6% compared with the previous week and was 17% higher than the same week one year ago.</p><blockquote>“Mortgage applications fell to their lowest level since May, with both purchase and refinance activity declining over the week.

    <description><![CDATA[This deepening crisis means that without interventions aimed at significantly ramping up affordable housing supply, the city's affordability gap could linger for generations.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX— A recently released analysis from Realtor.com paints a startling picture of New York City's rental market. The median asking rent in New York City accounted for 55% of a typical household income in the second quarter of 2025, almost 10% above the national median in the for-sale market, which sits at 44.5% and more than double the recent share for typical renters across the U.S.</p><p>Across the boroughs, renters feel a similar, if not worse, strain. In the Bronx, the rent-to-income ratio sits at a staggering 81.6%, while in Brooklyn the figure is 60.6%. It's 56.9% in Manhattan, and 49.4% in Queens; this highlights the premium that many are willing to pay to live in the Big Apple and how many of the city's renters are being priced out of even historically lower-cost areas.</p><blockquote>“In the Bronx, rent now eats up about 82% of a typical household income, nearly triple the recommended standard of 30%. Even if rents were frozen today, it would still take two decades of steady income growth to restore affordability,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “New Yorkers can't wait decades to meaningfully close this gap. Housing supply has already featured prominently in this year's mayoral race. These figures underscore why the city's mayoral candidates must have a credible, multi-faceted plan to tackle housing supply if they hope to be elected to lead the city in the fall."</blockquote><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Rents-by-Borough.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/Rents-by-Borough.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/Rents-by-Borough.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/Rents-by-Borough.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Rents-by-Borough.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the Bronx, rents increased a staggering 61.4% over the last six years, marking the largest jump of any borough. Renters there are looking at a median asking rent of $3,132, nearly $2,000 more than the max affordable rent under current income, which is $1,152. In Brooklyn, rent increased 40.8% in the last six years, and the median asking rent is $3,835, while the max affordable rent under current income is $1,892.</p><p>The data underscores a reality that's influencing political momentum around housing, and a notable driver of Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the Democratic NYC mayoral primary. With renters now making up a record 70% of households, New Yorkers are demanding urgent solutions as affordability deteriorates across all boroughs.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Affordability-by-Borough-Manhattan-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--4-569--96-301-56.9---Brooklyn-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--3-835--75-696-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1920" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/Affordability-by-Borough-Manhattan-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--4-569--96-301-56.9---Brooklyn-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--3-835--75-696-6.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/Affordability-by-Borough-Manhattan-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--4-569--96-301-56.9---Brooklyn-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--3-835--75-696-6.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/Affordability-by-Borough-Manhattan-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--4-569--96-301-56.9---Brooklyn-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--3-835--75-696-6.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Affordability-by-Borough-Manhattan-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--4-569--96-301-56.9---Brooklyn-Median-Asking-Rent-Household-Income-Rent-to-Income-Ratio--3-835--75-696-6.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This deepening crisis means that without interventions aimed at significantly ramping up affordable housing supply, the city's affordability gap could linger for generations.

    <description><![CDATA[HGAR’s Hawkins-Syska told the gathering that the raising of the SALT Cap to $40,000 “is a big win for our communities.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YORKTOWN—At a press conference on Aug. 1. U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY-17), along with a host of county and local government officials and representatives of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, hailed the inclusion of an increase in the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap that was included in "One Big Beautiful Bill," or H.R. 1 that was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on July 4. </p><p>Rep. Lawler led the press conference held at Yorktown Town Hall to highlight the SALT Cap deduction limit change, which was raised from $10,000 to $40,000 thanks to a contingent of Congressmen that were part of the House SALT Caucus, who fought for the increase to be included in the controversial HR1 bill, which included Rep. Lawler. HGAR Regional Director-Westchester Crystal Hawkins-Syska spoke at the press conference on the SALT Cap change’s impact on the real estate market. Also attending the event from HGAR were HGAR 2025 President Vlora Sedji and Alexander Roithmayr, Director of Government Affairs.</p><p>Under the bill, beginning with the 2025 tax year, homeowners can claim up to $40,000 in SALT deductions, quadruple the $10,000 maximum in effect from 2018 through 2024. The deduction increases slightly each year through 2029, then reverts to $10,000 unless Congress acts to preserve the increase. (There’s a phasedown for those with modified adjusted gross income over $500,000.) The new law also preserves mortgage interest deductibility at the level set in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>Also attending the press conference were approximately a dozen vocal critics of the Big Beautiful Bill who complained about the bill’s cuts to vital programs and its impact on the federal deficit.</p><p>Rep. Lawler also touted a $6,000 federal tax credit for seniors and a $2,200 child tax credit that were part of the Big Beautiful bill. “As we all know, Rockland, Westchester and Putnam counties are three of the top 16 highest property-tax counties in America. And so, this is squarely targeted at the hard-working families in these communities,” Rep. Lawler said.</p><blockquote>HGAR’s Hawkins-Syska told the gathering that the raising of the SALT Cap to $40,000 “is a big win for our communities.

    <description><![CDATA[The Out of Reach report found that the cost of housing in the Hudson Valley continues to rise faster than wages for renters and buyers.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWBURGH—The latest report by locally-based Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress on the region’s wages as it relates to the cost of rental and for-sale housing once again finds that for many the price tag continues to be “out of reach.”</p><p>Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress and its Center for Housing Solutions &amp; Community Initiatives recently released its annual “Out of Reach 2025” report, which examined the affordability of rental housing and homeownership throughout the nine counties it serves: Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester. The report, based largely on data published annually by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, compared fair-market rents with average renter wages to arrive at the “Rent Gap”—the difference between fair market rental costs and rents that would be affordable to tenants earning average wages. In addition, the report compared 2024 home sales prices and Area Median Incomes throughout the Hudson Valley to provide what it called the “Mortgage Gap” which shows the challenges faced by median earners trying to buy their first home in the Hudson Valley.</p><p>The Out of Reach report found that the cost of housing in the Hudson Valley continues to rise faster than wages for renters and buyers. Over the five-year period from 2020 through 2025, the average rent gap grew steadily in nearly every county, with Ulster increasing by $388 (59%), Westchester by $454 (47%), and Columbia by $222 (54%). Even over the past year alone, counties like Sullivan and Westchester saw sharp year-over-year jumps of $141 (48%) and $336 (31%), respectively. For the first time this year, two working adults sharing the cost of rent in Westchester cannot afford a two-bedroom apartment without spending more than 30% of their incomes on housing costs, the report stated.</p><blockquote>“Our latest report shows that our housing crisis in the Hudson Valley is deepening, and that our civic leaders must continue to collaborate on viable solutions to produce more housing and promote affordability. The exorbitant cost of homeownership is beyond the reach of most of our neighbors,” said Adam Bosch, president and CEO of Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress. “Rent continues to rise much faster than tenant wages. And many of our working neighbors—filling necessary and honorable jobs in our communities—are now living on public assistance in hotels because they cannot find housing at a modest cost.”</blockquote><p>Bosch added, “The risks associated with this trend—a shrinking workforce, fewer customers for local businesses, and greater migration out of the region—are too big for us not to act in the interest of the entire region.</p><p>One of the report’s key conclusions is that “given the high cost of new construction, many regional stakeholders worry that stricter affordability mandates could unintentionally stifle development. Tackling this crisis demands a broader toolkit—one that mixes traditional interventions with new, bold, flexible solutions. The Hudson Valley must build more housing of every type, preserve existing affordable homes, support cooperative ownership and community land trusts, enable the construction of smaller homes on smaller lots, expand zoning to accommodate mobile and tiny home communities, require landlords to accept housing vouchers, and redefine affordability benchmarks based on actual renter incomes—not medians skewed by high-earning homeowners.”</p><p>The following are some of the key findings from Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress’ Out of Reach report.</p><ol>
<li>Single adults working 40 hours per week on average wages cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in any of the nine counties. Tenants’ hourly wages would need to increase between $4.77 and $32.64 to afford fair-market rents in their respective counties.</li>
<li>Fair-market rents would need to decline anywhere from $248 to $1,697 per month to make them affordable for a person earning average renter wages across the region. Affordable means that tenants do not spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs.</li>
<li>The proportional increase in rent continued to outpace wage growth in most counties. For approximately 10 years, the proportional increase in rent has doubled wage growth; and that gap has grown more quickly from 2022-2024. This year's picture was more mixed, however.</li>
<li>Wages earned by a typical renter ranged from 36% to 49% of the area median income in each county, a key metric for housing policies and programs. In 2023, average renters earned 39% to 61% of the area median income. This change underscores that greater wage growth is happening in the higher income brackets, while renter wages remain stagnant.</li>
<li>The majority of households in the Hudson Valley cannot qualify for enough mortgage financing to purchase the median priced home in any of the nine Hudson Valley counties. This is true for one-person, two-person, and four-person households making median wages in each county. A two-person household falls anywhere from $102,257 (Sullivan) to $353,945 (Rockland) short of qualifying for enough mortgage to buy the typical home in each county. This widening gap is a function of modest wage growth compared to a skyrocketing home market that has seen median sales increase by nearly double in many of the counties since 2019, the report stated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress is a nonprofit organization that provides objective research, planning, and educational training throughout the region. Pattern was founded in 1965 and serves a nine-county region that includes Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester counties.</p><p>To access the full Out of Reach 2025 report, go to: <a href="https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/out-of-reach-2025/">https://www.pattern-for-progress.org/portfolio/out-of-reach-2025/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Seventy-five percent of metro markets (170 out of 228) registered home price gains in the second quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors' Metropolitan Median Area Prices and Affordability and Housing Affordability Index.

However, elevated mortgage rates have kept home sales below pre-COVID levels. The homeownership rate has fallen by a full percentage point since early 2023. If interest rates decline, the strongest release of pent-up housing demand is likely to occur in states with significant job growth in recent years, such as Idaho, Utah, the Carolinas, Florida, and Texas.”</p><h3 id="10-large-markets-with-biggest-year-over-year-median-price-increases">10 Large Markets with Biggest<br>Year-Over-Year Median Price Increases</h3><p>Toledo, OH (10.5%)<br>Jackson, MS (10.5%)<br>Nassau County-Suffolk County, NY (9.6%)<br>New Haven-Milford, CT (9.0%)<br>Reading, PA (8.3%)<br>Springfield, MO (8.2%)<br>Akron, OH (8.1%)<br>Montgomery, AL (7.9%)<br>Cleveland-Elyria, OH (7.8%)<br>Rochester, NY (7.8%)</p><h3 id="10-most-expensive-markets">10 Most Expensive Markets</h3><p>San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA ($2,138,000; 6.5%)<br>Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA ($1,431,500; -0.4%)<br>San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA ($1,426,000; -1.6%)<br>Urban Honolulu, HI ($1,148,600; 4.3%)<br>San Diego-Carlsbad, CA ($1,025,000; -2.4%)<br>Salinas-Monterey, CA ($978,400; -5.5%)<br>Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA ($958,100; 3.3%)<br>San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, CA ($928,000; 3.7%)<br>Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA ($879,900; 2.9%)<br>Boulder, CO ($859,500; -3.2%).</p><h3 id="housing-affordability-trends">Housing Affordability Trends</h3><ul>

    <description><![CDATA[The expiration of federal vouchers and the city’s transition to state and local replacements make this a pivotal moment for housing policy.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors recently hosted a timely and impactful event on the evolving landscape of housing vouchers and the implications of New York City’s Fair Access to Rental Enforcement (FARE) Act. This discussion brought together industry leaders, housing professionals, and members to explore urgent issues affecting rental housing access, landlord obligations, and compliance with new legal requirements. </p><h3 id="a-critical-moment-for-housing-policy">A Critical Moment for Housing Policy</h3><p>The conversation on Aug. 6 at the Hutchinson Metro Center in the Bronx took place against a backdrop of significant policy shifts and funding changes in New York’s housing market. According to <em>Gothamist</em>, thousands of federal rental vouchers are set to expire due to the end of a major federal program. In response, New York City plans to replace them with state and local programs—a move intended to preserve housing stability for low-income residents but one that introduces new administrative and financial hurdles for landlords and housing providers.</p><p>At the same time, the FARE Act, enacted in 2023, is reshaping the legal landscape for rental transactions. It establishes stricter rules on broker fees and strengthens tenant protections, creating additional compliance considerations for agents, landlords and property managers. Together, these developments are redefining how the rental market functions—making education and advocacy more important than ever.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/IMG_4512.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/IMG_4512.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/IMG_4512.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/IMG_4512.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/IMG_4512.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">HGAR hosted the event on Aug. 6 at the Hutchinson Metro Center in the Bronx.</em></i></figcaption></figure><h3 id="expert-perspectives-from-the-front-lines">Expert Perspectives from the Front Lines</h3><p>The event featured a panel of housing experts, each bringing unique insights from legal, operational, and community-focused perspectives:</p><p><strong>John Dolgetta, Esq</strong>.—HGAR’s legal counsel and managing partner of Dolgetta Law, PLLC, offered in-depth legal guidance on compliance with the FARE Act. He detailed landlords’ obligations, anti-discrimination measures and the proper handling of broker fees. His remarks underscored that legal clarity and documentation are essential to minimizing disputes and supporting fair housing practices.</p><p><strong>Emran Bhuiyan</strong> – Associate Broker, Director of Sales at EXIT Realty Premium, and a Bronx-based landlord, spoke candidly about the realities of working with voucher programs. He acknowledged bureaucratic challenges, such as delayed payments, but also emphasized that vouchers can help maintain steady occupancy and provide long-term stability for property owners.</p><p><strong>Annerys Escarraman </strong>– Licensed real estate agent and housing voucher specialist with more than 500 successful placements, provided first-hand accounts of the barriers tenants face when searching for housing. She stressed the critical role of Realtors and landlords in facilitating access for voucher holders and ensuring a smooth rental process.</p><p>The discussion was moderated by <strong>HGAR President-Elect Rey Hollingsworth Falu</strong>, who guided the conversation to cover both the practical and policy aspects of these changes.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/IMG_4514.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/IMG_4514.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/IMG_4514.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/IMG_4514.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/IMG_4514.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Dr. Jermaine Meadows, Moderator HGAR President-Elect Rey Hollingsworth Falu, Annerys Escarraman, Emran Bhuiyan and John Dolgetta, Esq.</em></i></figcaption></figure><h3 id="key-takeaways-from-the-discussion">Key Takeaways from the Discussion</h3><p><strong>Housing Vouchers 101</strong>—The panel clarified how vouchers operate, the eligibility process, and landlord participation requirements. Understanding these mechanics is vital for any professional working in the rental market.</p><p><strong>Compliance with the FARE Act</strong>—Panelists broke down the new rules governing broker fees, emphasizing that tenants can no longer be required to pay fees in certain situations. Enhanced tenant protections mean landlords and agents must be diligent in their procedures to avoid costly mistakes.</p><p><strong>Impact on Agents and Landlords</strong>—While administrative delays and paperwork can be challenging, voucher programs offer a dependable source of rental income and a pathway to expanding a landlord’s tenant pool. Agents are encouraged to develop best practices to navigate both the voucher process and the FARE Act’s compliance requirements.</p><p><strong>Local Realities in the Bronx</strong>—The Bronx market’s high demand, affordability pressures and unique neighborhood dynamics shaped much of the conversation. Panelists noted that understanding local market conditions is key to making voucher participation successful for both landlords and tenants.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/IMG_4590.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/IMG_4590.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/IMG_4590.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/IMG_4590.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/IMG_4590.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Moderator HGAR President-Elect Rey Hollingsworth Falu, Annerys Escarraman, Emran Bhuiyan and John Dolgetta, Esq.</em></i></figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-this-matters-now">Why This Matters Now</h3><p>The expiration of federal vouchers and the city’s transition to state and local replacements make this a pivotal moment for housing policy.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SLATE HILL—Two months after some believed it was dealt a death blow by the town’s Zoning Board of Appeals, Scannell Properties’ plan to build a 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon distribution center re-emerged last night before the Town of Wawayanda Planning Board, seeking a height exemption the developer says it can be granted under the Town Code.</p><p>In fact, the strategy has initially paid off as the height exemption application for the estimated $607-million project will be debated at a requested-for Planning Board public hearing next month.</p><p>On June 12, the Town of Wawayanda’s Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously (4-0) to reject a needed height variance for the Amazon project. While some observers indicated the project was killed by the ZBA, neither Amazon nor Scannell officially withdrew the project. Instead, Scannell officials told the Wawayanda Planning Board last night (Aug. 13) that Town Code 195-13 specifically allows for a project to be granted a height exemption if its fire-fighting capacity is sufficient and if its property buffers are greater than required.</p><p>Matt Boone, development manager of Indianapolis, IN-based Scannell Properties, testified before the Planning Board that the project meets both exemption requirements and that its fire suppression system had recently been approved by the Department of State.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Amazon-rendering-1-1-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="675" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/Amazon-rendering-1-1-1.webp 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/Amazon-rendering-1-1-1.webp 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Amazon-rendering-1-1-1.webp 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A rendering of the 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon project in Slate Hill.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of setbacks, Boone noted that the project offers setbacks that are anywhere between 650% to 2,000% greater than the setback requirements by the town.</p><p>The Scannell project, also known as “Project Bluebird,” had already received a favorable negative declaration by the Planning Board on June 11 on its requested special use permit, but the project failed to garner the necessary height variance (from 35 feet to approximately 66 feet) from the ZBA to allow it to proceed any further.</p><p>After going into executive session to discuss Scannell’s request for a Sept. 10 public hearing in connection with its amended site plan in reference to the height exemption and a referral for the height matter to be reviewed by the Orange County Planning Department, the Planning Board unanimously granted both requests.</p><p>Planning Board Chairman John Razzano said the Scannell application for height exemption after being denied by the ZBA for a variance is something he has never seen during his time on the board.</p><p>Boone of Scannell had no comment on its plans and the factors that led it to go before the Planning Board with its height exemption requests. It is possible that the Planning Board could grant the necessary height exemption and special use permit approval for the project in the coming months.</p><p>The controversial project proposed by a partnership of Scannell Properties and Amazon Services, LLC, is considered to be among the largest ever private investment projects in Orange County. The plan calls for the construction of a five-story, 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon robotic fulfillment/distribution center in Slate Hill. Each floor (two below grade and three above grade) would total approximately 600,000 square feet. The project is also under review by the Orange County Industrial Development Agency.</p><p>The Scannell-Amazon venture is currently seeking state and local sales tax exemptions from the Orange County IDA of up to $18,821,250 for qualified expenditures of up to $250 million and another $12,187,500 for state and local sales taxes in connection with other qualified expenditures of up to $150 million, putting the proposed total exemptions at more than $31 million. The venture will also be seeking a PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) with the Minisink School District and other taxing jurisdictions.</p><p>Back in 2023, Scannell and Amazon secured approvals for a 900,000-square-foot warehouse at the 22 McBride Road site, but eventually submitted a much larger proposal. The 100-acre property is currently an active quarry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[With the advent of artificial intelligence and the increased use of sophisticated algorithms in software and real estate platforms, the risks in violating antitrust law and engaging in anticompetitive behavior increase exponentially and must be carefully considered and assessed.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few years have reshaped how antitrust law intersects with the real estate industry. Courts have approved sweeping nationwide settlements that changed commission practices. The Department of Justice (DOJ) turned up general antitrust enforcement, including on data-driven “algorithmic pricing.” In July, the National Association of Realtors secured several key defense victories in various antitrust lawsuits upholding long-standing membership structures, like the three-way agreement. For brokers, agents, and legal counsel, the through-line is simple: competition rules are tightening, documentation expectations are rising, and antitrust pitfalls now extend well beyond commission conversations.</p><h3 id="antitrust-101-in-the-real-estate-context">Antitrust 101 in the Real Estate Context</h3><p><br>U.S. antitrust law prohibits agreements that unreasonably restrain trade (<em>see </em>Sherman Act § 1 at <a href="https://bit.ly/45rTCbq">https://bit.ly/45rTCbq</a>), monopolization and attempted monopolization (<em>see</em> Sherman Act § 2 at <a href="https://bit.ly/4oEKNUE">https://bit.ly/4oEKNUE</a>), and unfair methods of competition (<em>see </em>FTC Act § 5 at <a href="https://bit.ly/3V4Tbz2">https://bit.ly/3V4Tbz2</a>). Some of the violations are “per se” violations, which do not require any further analysis and are deemed violations on their face. Per se violations (e.g., price fixing or bid rigging) are inherently anticompetitive and courts do not analyze market effects. Simply engaging in the described behavior will constitute a violation.</p><p>Other violations are categorized as and analyzed under the “rule-of-reason.” The rule-of-reason antitrust analysis deals with more nuanced restraints, such as tying arrangements or Resale Price Maintenance (RPM), and requires evaluation of both pro- and anticompetitive effects in context of each specific case. The courts will assess whether the restraint has plausible, pro-competitive justifications or anti-competitive results.</p><h3 id="various-types-of-restraints-of-trade">Various Types of Restraints of Trade</h3><p><br><em>Horizontal Restraints of Trade</em></p><p>Under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, there are various forms of anti-competitive behavior that violate the law. These are normally considered horizontal restraints or violations. Violations can be categorized as either per se or rule-of-reason. Below is a list of the types of violations:</p><p><strong>Price Fixing</strong>: Competitors colluding to set prices arbitrarily (per se).</p><p><strong>Market Allocation</strong>: Dividing markets or customers among competitors (per se).</p><p><strong>Bid Rigging</strong>: Collusion to manipulate bidding (per se).</p><p><strong>Tying Arrangements</strong>: The requirement that there be a purchase of one product to get another. Often these are “per se” illegal, but sometimes they are also evaluated under the rule-of-reason when justifications apply.</p><p><strong>Group Boycotts</strong>: Competitors refusing to do business with a target firm. In some instances, treated as per se violations.</p><p><strong>Monopolization</strong>: When a dominant firm unlawfully maintains or achieves monopoly power via anticompetitive means.</p><p><strong>Attempted Monopolization</strong>: Efforts to monopolize, even if unsuccessful, are actionable when they exclude competitors unfairly.</p><p><em>Vertical Restraints of Trade</em></p><p>There are also other laws that focus on vertical restraints of trade and anticompetitive behavior. Sections 3 and 7 of the Clayton Act (<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/4703lZ4">https://bit.ly/4703lZ4</a>) deal with the following types of antitrust violations:</p><p><strong>Tying</strong>: Like tying arrangements covered under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act specifically targets conditional sales that harm competition.</p><p><strong>Resale Price Maintenance</strong>: Manufacturers controlling the minimum or maximum prices at which retailers can sell goods. This type of violation is scrutinized under the rule-of-reason analysis.</p><p><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions</strong>: Transactions likely to lessen competition or foster monopoly are restricted.</p><h3 id="antitrust-violations-in-the-real-estate-industry">Antitrust Violations in the Real Estate Industry</h3><p><br>In the real estate industry, it is important to note the areas of risk involving antitrust and anti-competitive behavior. A common violation consists of horizontal agreements among competing brokers or MLS participants (e.g., setting minimum commissions, boycotts/steering, or coordinated rules that suppress competition). These can be determined to be per se unlawful (e.g., naked price-fixing), or may be analyzed under the rule-of-reason when the restraint has plausible pro-competitive justifications.</p><p>Information exchanges that utilize and reveal sensitive pricing and strategy data, and reduce independent decision-making can also be an area of risk as is evident in the Greystar/RealPage matter (discussed below). Implementing tying arrangements and mandatory membership (i.e., access to one product or platform conditioned on buying another) if they foreclose competition is an area of risk. It is also important for platform rules (i.e., MLS participation and listing policies) to be carefully implemented to ensure that they do not materially exclude rivals or involve any price-fixing components.</p><p>A more recent development in the antitrust field, which can give rise to new risks, involves “algorithmic coordination” where competitors utilize a shared pricing algorithm or vendor that harmonizes pricing with competitors’ non-public data as evidenced in the Greystar/RealPage case (below). With the advent of artificial intelligence and the increased use of sophisticated algorithms in software and real estate platforms, the risks in violating antitrust law and engaging in anticompetitive behavior increase exponentially and must be carefully considered and assessed.</p><h3 id="recent-nar-decisions-muhammad-homie-and-eytalis">Recent NAR Decisions: Muhammad, Homie, and Eytalis</h3><p><br><em>Muhammad v. National Association of Realtors</em></p><p>In <em>Muhammad v. NAR</em> (July 31, 2025) (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4oFintx">https://bit.ly/4oFintx</a>), a Pennsylvania real estate professional alleged Sherman Act §§ 1–2 violations and various civil-rights claims tied to MLS access and association conduct. The plaintiff, a real estate broker, who represented himself, claimed that NAR and local Realtor associations violated antitrust laws by tying MLS access to NAR membership. He also alleged racial discrimination and suppression of minority professionals. The court dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint finding the allegations conclusory and insufficient to plausibly plead an antitrust conspiracy, antitrust injury or state action for the constitutional claims.</p><p>The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, calling the allegations “bare and conclusory.” There were insufficient factual allegations showing an anticompetitive restraint under Section 1 or proof of monopoly under Section 2. The tying claim failed under the Rule-of-Reason analysis because no evidence demonstrated that membership fees were exclusionary or that there was unreasonable restraint in trade. The ruling is significant as it reinforces that absent evidence of anticompetitive impact, structural membership and MLS access requirements (i.e., the three-way agreement) do not violate antitrust law.</p><p><em>Homie Technology v. NAR</em></p><p>In <em>Homie Technology v. NAR </em>(July 15, 2025) (<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4fENEc9">https://bit.ly/4fENEc9</a>), Homie, a flat-fee brokerage firm, alleged NAR and major brokerages orchestrated a boycott and steering scheme, sidelining Homie from offering lower buyer agent commissions under rules like the Clear Cooperation Policy. Again, in this case, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice, holding Homie failed to plausibly allege antitrust injury.</p><p>The court held that Homie did not offer any facts or evidence showing foreclosure, exclusion, or barriers to entry caused by the defendants. Homie also failed to establish the required element of coordinated boycotting. Additionally, the judge also dismissed the case on the grounds that Homie failed to meet the statute of limitations. Homie has filed an appeal with the Tenth Circuit.</p><p><em>Eytalis v. NAR</em></p><p>In <em>Eytalis v. NAR </em>(July 23, 2025) (<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/41DQpEG">https://bit.ly/41DQpEG</a>), similar to the <em>Muhammad</em> case, a Texas broker challenged membership requirements tied to MLS access and alleged that the three-way membership structure violated both federal and state antitrust law. The district court dismissed the claims, holding that the pleadings did not support an antitrust violation or the related state-law theories. Again, this decision underscores that the facts of a particular case, and not baseless claims or conclusions, are an indispensable and critical part of any antitrust lawsuit. Plaintiffs must show concrete, coordinated conduct causing antitrust injury (e.g., output reduction, price elevation, or exclusion), not just disagreement with association policies, or else a court will likely dismiss a plaintiff’s case.</p><h3 id="another-recent-antitrust-development-greystarrealpage-litigation-algorithmic-rental-pricing">Another Recent Antitrust Development:<br>Greystar/RealPage Litigation &amp; Algorithmic Rental Pricing</h3><p><br>In August 2024, the DOJ and eight states (NC, CA, CO, CT, MN, OR, TN, WA) sued RealPage, a major vendor of revenue-management software used by large apartment owners and managers. The DOJ alleged that RealPage ran an unlawful information-sharing and price-coordination scheme where landlords fed the software non-public, competitively sensitive data (e.g., executed rents, concessions, occupancy, and other pricing information), and the algorithm then generated rent recommendations informed by rivals’ confidential data.</p><p>According to the DOJ’s complaint, RealPage created a hub-and-spoke platform where competitors regularly contributed non-public data and, in return, received coordinated pricing recommendations. Features like “auto-accept,” advisor monitoring of compliance, and limits on concessions allegedly pushed participating landlords toward uniform pricing behavior. The DOJ pled both a Section 1 conspiracy (unreasonable restraint of trade) and a Section 2 claim (monopolization of revenue-management software).</p><p>Greystar, the largest U.S. residential property manager, with roughly 950,000 units under management, was one of the landlords the DOJ said utilized RealPage’s tools and shared competitively sensitive data. On August 8, 2025, the DOJ announced a proposed consent decree and settlement (<u>see</u> <a href="https://bit.ly/45W9TXy">https://bit.ly/45W9TXy</a>) with Greystar (which remains subject to court approval), requiring it to halt using pricing tools that incorporate competitors’ data and to avoid sensitive information sharing. Washington D.C.’s Attorney General also obtained an initial settlement with another landlord in June 2025. It is expected that there will be continued enforcement on data-sharing and algorithmic coordination. The broader RealPage litigation continues in federal and state courts.</p><h3 id="compliance-pitfalls-and-practical-guardrails">Compliance Pitfalls and Practical Guardrails</h3><p><br>It is critical not to discuss competitively sensitive terms with competitors. It is imperative to avoid any and all conversations, whether they take place online, at association meetings, or in private, about specific commission rates, fee “floors,” steering strategies, or any other anticompetitive behavior. It is important to involve legal counsel in all instances and to use robust antitrust protocols in connection with legitimate collaboration in the market.</p><p>It is also important to review and vet data, algorithms, and related software and software providers. If pricing or lead-management tools that ingest market data are utilized, it is critical to confirm that these tools do not incorporate competitors’ non-public, current pricing or strategic inputs, and that outputs are independently reviewed. Firms should establish vendor diligence questionnaires, restrict data feeds, and document independent decision-making, and a focus sharpened by the DOJ’s RealPage action and the Greystar settlement.</p><p>One important best practice is to document pro-competitive justifications. For any policies that could affect rivals or competition (e.g., listing timing, data-standard requirements), record the consumer benefits, such as accuracy, fraud prevention, interoperability, safety, and always consider less-restrictive alternatives. Refreshing policies and training on a frequent basis also serves to protect against potential violations.</p><p>Antitrust risk in real estate now exists on various fronts: commission rule reforms are here to stay; plaintiffs continue to challenge MLS and association membership requirements; and data-driven coordination is yet another enforcement priority. NAR’s recent legal victories in <em>Muhammad</em>, <em>Homie</em>, and <em>Eytalis</em> show that courts will dismiss pleadings that are thin and conclusory, but they have also upheld the basic membership structure that has been an important part of NAR and the industry for many years. However, the bigger picture is the continued scrutiny of how the industry organizes information, sets rules, and competes. The firms that fare best will embed compliance into daily practice, including transparent negotiations, disciplined communications, careful vendor oversight, and policies that promote competition while protecting consumers.</p><p>Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq., is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS, the largest multiple listing service in New York, recently released its July 2025 Market Report, revealing a continued upward trend in home prices across the region, even as overall sales activity slows.</p><p>Closed sales for all property types across the New York Metropolitan region declined 2.2% year-over-year to 4,523 transactions. Single-family homes saw a 2.6% drop, co-ops fell 3.0%, while condos posted a slight 0.4% increase.</p><p>Despite the dip in closings, prices continued to rise: the median sales price for single-family homes jumped 7.3% to $775,000, condos rose 7.1% to $525,000, and co-ops matched that growth with a 7.1% increase to $300,000.</p><blockquote>“The consistent rise in median prices across all property types tells a clear story,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Even with fewer transactions, demand remains strong enough to push prices higher. Sellers who price strategically are seeing solid results, and buyers are still stepping up when the right opportunity presents itself.”</blockquote><p>Current mortgage conditions are playing a significant role in shaping buyer behavior. As of mid-August, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 6.55%. With rates hovering near multi-year highs, many buyers are recalibrating budgets and timing, but the data shows that when homes are priced right, they’re still attracting offers, OneKey MLS officials stated.</p><p>Looking ahead to the remainder of 2025, market dynamics are expected to remain complex. Inventory constraints and elevated mortgage rates may continue to temper sales volume, but pricing strength is likely to persist, especially in high-demand areas. Buyers and sellers alike should stay informed and work closely with real estate professionals to navigate evolving conditions, the OneKey MLS report stated.</p><p>To access additional regional Market Reports, visit <a href="https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/">https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[With rising political polarization and increasing housing challenges, our industry cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At HGAR, advocacy isn’t just a department—it’s a cornerstone of who we are as Realtors. Every transaction we close, every client we serve, and every community we support is directly shaped by public policy. Laws and regulations dictate everything from housing supply and affordability, to property taxes, to fair housing enforcement, to whether or not New Yorkers can access rental assistance. That’s why advocacy is not optional—it’s essential. </p><p>One of the most important tools we have in that fight is the Realtors Political Action Committee (RPAC). For over five decades, RPAC has given our industry a strong and consistent voice in Albany, in New York City, and in Washington, D.C. It has allowed Realtors to help elect champions for housing and real estate, to stop harmful legislation, and to advance forward-looking policies that strengthen communities.</p><p>This week, we are proud to recognize our Gold R Major Investors leaders who understand the stakes and have stepped up at one of the highest levels of political giving in our industry. Their commitment ensures that HGAR and our Realtor colleagues across the state remain influential, credible and effective in shaping housing policy.</p><h3 id="why-rpac-matters">Why RPAC Matters</h3><p>For some, RPAC is just another acronym in our industry. But for those who have seen its impact firsthand, RPAC is the difference between being at the table when decisions are made—or being on the menu.</p><p>When Realtors invest in RPAC, those dollars go toward supporting candidates and elected officials on both sides of the aisle who believe in protecting private property rights, promoting homeownership and ensuring a healthy real estate market. It’s not about partisanship. It’s about partnership and making sure housing has champions in every chamber of government.</p><p>None of this happens by accident. It happens because Realtors are engaged, organized and willing to invest in advocacy through RPAC.</p><h3 id="the-gold-r-standard">The Gold R Standard</h3><p>Major investors are the backbone of RPAC. Their leadership inspires others and fuels the kind of advocacy that protects our industry for years to come.</p><p>The Gold R level represents a contribution of $5,000 annually to RPAC. It is a significant investment, but one that demonstrates deep belief in our mission and our collective strength.</p><p>We are proud to honor this year’s Gold R Major Investors:</p><p><strong>Irene Guanill</strong></p><p><strong>Tony D’Anzica</strong></p><p><strong>Susan Goldy</strong></p><p>Each of these leaders has not only supported our advocacy financially, but also shown what it means to lead by example. They remind us that RPAC is not just about dollars—it’s about dedication, vision and ensuring Realtors always have a seat at the table.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Guanill_DAnzica_Goldy.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="472" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/Guanill_DAnzica_Goldy.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/Guanill_DAnzica_Goldy.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/Guanill_DAnzica_Goldy.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Irene Guanill, Tony D'Anzica and Susan Goldy</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-this-matters-to-every-member">Why This Matters to Every Member</h3><p>Some members may ask, “What does RPAC have to do with me?” The answer is: “everything.”</p><p>Every client who closes on their first home.</p><p>Every small business that secures a commercial lease.</p><p>Every landlord who depends on stable housing policy.</p><p>Every Realtor who relies on clear, fair and consistent rules to run their business.</p><p>All of that is shaped by government—and by our ability to influence government. Even if you’ve never attended a lobbying day in Albany or City Hall, you benefit directly from RPAC’s advocacy every day you practice real estate.</p><p>That’s why honoring our Gold R Investors isn’t just about thanking a few individuals.

    <description><![CDATA[The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—U.S. existing-home sales increased by 2.0% in July, according to the National Association of Realtors Existing-Home Sales Report released today (Aug. 21).</p><p>Month-over-month sales increased in the Northeast, South, and West, and fell in the Midwest. Year-over-year, sales rose in the South, Northeast, and Midwest, and fell in the West.</p><blockquote>“The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices. Condominium sales increased in the South region, where prices had been falling for the past year.”</blockquote><p>“Near-zero growth in home prices suggests that roughly half the country is experiencing price reductions. Overall, homeowners are doing well financially. Only 2% of sales were foreclosures or short sales—essentially a historic low. The market’s health is supported by a cumulative 49% home price appreciation for a typical American homeowner from pre-COVID July 2019 to July this year,” Dr. Yun continued. “Homebuyers are in the best position in more than five years to find the right home and negotiate for a better price. Current inventory is at its highest since May 2020, during the COVID lockdown.”</p><h3 id="national-snapshot">National Snapshot</h3><p><br><strong>Total Existing-Home Sales for July</strong></p><ul>

    <description><![CDATA[In July, inventory saw small gains in some counties, but the market is still tight overall.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors released its July 2025 housing report on Aug. 21, showing that the region’s real estate market remains resilient with continued price strength, even as inventory challenges persist.</p><p>Data from OneKey MLS shows a blend of rising prices, growing days on market, and stabilizing sales activity in several counties—highlighting the complexity of this post-pandemic housing environment, the report stated.</p><blockquote>“Westchester continues to drive regional price trends, but we’re seeing interesting activity across our entire footprint,” said HGAR Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez. “In July, inventory saw small gains in some counties, but the market is still tight overall. While sales are slightly down in some places, prices are holding, indicating strong underlying demand. Buyers are adapting, expanding their options, and looking for value, while sellers are adjusting expectations and timelines.”</blockquote><h2 id="key-regional-trends">Key Regional Trends</h2><p><br><strong>Mortgage Rates:</strong> With 30-year mortgage rates averaging around 7% in July, many buyers remain cautious. Still, the Hudson Valley continues to attract those seeking space, value, and proximity to New York City.</p><p><strong>Shift in Buyer Behavior:</strong> Increased exploration of co-ops, condos and townhomes continues, as affordability remains top of mind.</p><p><strong>Luxury vs. Entry-Level: </strong>Homes under $500,000 are still moving quickly, while higher-end properties are lingering longer and often require strategic pricing and staging.</p><p><strong>Inventory and Leverage:</strong> Inventory remains below the 6-month to 9-month levels that are considered balanced. Markets like the Bronx, now at more than 7 months of inventory, are offering buyers more negotiating room, while counties like Westchester and Rockland remain seller-favored.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/08/2025_07_Westchester_County-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="973" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/2025_07_Westchester_County-1.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/2025_07_Westchester_County-1.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/2025_07_Westchester_County-1.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/2025_07_Westchester_County-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Westchester County</em></i></figcaption></figure><h2 id="county-highlights">County Highlights</h2><h3 id="westchester-county"><br><strong>Westchester County</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The median single-family home price hit $1,500,000 (+11% YoY).</li>
<li>Closed sales were up 4%, while new listings dropped 6%.</li>
<li>Days on market dropped to 18, down 5%, and months of inventory remained tight at 2.5.</li>

<li>Median price rose to $468,000 (+9.5%).</li>
<li>Co-ops remain in high demand, up 6.7% in median price.</li>
<li>Closed sales were down 16%, and new listings dropped slightly by 1.7%.</li>
<li>Inventory at 7.6 months offers more negotiating power for buyers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“With pricing trends holding firm and slight upticks in inventory, we’re seeing a transition—not a downturn,” HGAR’s Fernandez added. “Buyers who are prepared and realistic can find opportunities, and sellers should expect more measured activity. This is when professional guidance from a Realtor truly matters.”</blockquote><p>In today’s complex market, both buyers and sellers benefit from a strategic, informed approach. Buyers should be prepared with financing, stay flexible on location and property type, and act quickly on well-priced listings. Sellers should focus on competitive pricing and strong presentation, especially as higher-end homes spend more time on the market. Partnering with a knowledgeable Realtor is essential to navigating shifting conditions, uncovering opportunities, and making confident decisions, as the HGAR report related.</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The full July 2025 housing report, including interactive charts and county-level data, is available at <a href="https://www.hgar.com/news-stats/market-stats" rel="noreferrer">www.hgar.com/market-stats</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[While wages have risen 15.7% in the same time frame, they haven't kept pace with borrowing costs.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—In a market defined by higher interest rates and persistent affordability challenges, a new report from Realtor.com reveals just how far buyers' budgets are being stretched. According to the August 2025 Buying Power Report, only 28.0% of homes on the market were priced within reach of the typical household as the maximum affordable home price for a median-income household in the U.S. has fallen to $298,000. The figure is down nearly $30,000 from $325,000, which is where it sat in 2019.</p><blockquote>“Even as incomes grow, higher interest rates have eroded the real-world purchasing power of the typical American household,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com. “This dynamic is forcing many buyers to adjust their expectations, whether that means looking for smaller homes, moving farther out, or delaying the dream of homeownership altogether.”</blockquote><p>While wages have risen 15.7% in the same time frame, they haven't kept pace with borrowing costs. With mortgage rates hovering near 6.75% through July, the monthly mortgage payment on a $320,000 fixed-rate loan is $600 higher than it would have been at 2019's average rate. That's an additional $7,200 a year out of the average buyer's pocket, and that payment won't buy what it used to. In 2019 a $320,000 loan would have covered the entire median home price while today it would need to be accompanied by a nearly 28% down payment to buy the typical-listing (priced at $439,450).</p><h3 id="where-buyers-have-been-hit-hardest">Where Buyers Have Been Hit Hardest</h3><p>Buying power has dropped most dramatically in metros like Milwaukee, WI; Houston, TX; Baltimore, MD, New York City, and Kansas City, MO, all of which have seen declines of 9%–10.5% in what the median earner can afford. In Milwaukee, for example, which experienced the highest buying power percentage decrease of 10.5%, the maximum affordable home price fell from $314,000 to $281,000, a $33,000 drop.</p><p>While affordability declined, these metros still had a relatively high share of affordable homes—except for New York, where just 13.1% of listings in July were within reach of a median-income household.</p><p>In the New York City metro region (New York-Newark-Jersey City,<br>NY-NJ) the maximum target home price in 2019 was $397,000. In July 2025, the maximum target home price fell to $360,000, a decline of $37,000. That change in affordable price has priced many out of the market, the Realtor.com report data reveals. In 2109, 28.2% of the homes listed at or below the maximum target price. In July 2025, the share of listings in the lower maximum target price fell to 13.1%.</p><h3 id="where-has-buying-power-grown-the-most">Where Has Buying Power Grown the Most?</h3><p>Only six of the 50 largest U.S. metros saw buying power increase since 2019. Leading the way was Cleveland, OH, where strong wage gains helped boost the affordable home price from $249,000 to $260,000 (+4.4%). Also, an impressive 50% of inventory on the market in Cleveland in July was affordable to median-earning households.</p><p>Pandemic boomtowns like Phoenix, AZ, Tampa, FL, and Austin, TX have seen a slight boost in buying power thanks to rising wages. But even with that progress, rapid home price growth has outpaced income gains, leaving few truly affordable options. In fact, in all six markets where buying power has improved, the share of homes affordable to median-income buyers is still lower than it was in 2019, the report stated.</p><h3 id="the-impact-of-shrinking-buying-power-and-what-would-alleviate-it">The Impact of Shrinking Buying Power and What Would Alleviate It?</h3><p>Shrinking buying power isn't just a matter of dollars and cents, it's reshaping buyer behavior. As affordability declines, many buyers are competing more aggressively for lower-priced homes, turning to rentals when homeownership feels out of reach, or delaying their plans altogether—especially younger households without existing equity. This shift in demand also affects sellers, who may need to adjust pricing expectations or prepare for a longer time on market. Looking ahead, restoring lost buying power will likely depend on a combination of modestly lower mortgage rates, stronger wage growth, and most critically, a boost in housing supply, particularly in the affordable segment. Until those conditions improve, today's buyers will need to remain both strategic and flexible in navigating the market, Realtor.com noted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—In a no-holds-barred report, Realtor.com states that while the U.S. housing market may be showing signs of movement on paper, for many Americans, it feels like the market has stalled. According to Realtor.com's latest report released today (Aug. 26) entitled: “Cruel Summer: Why the U.S. Housing Market is Stuck,” buyers, sellers, and builders are all facing different challenges, yet all are united by one common experience: frustration.</p><blockquote>"The housing market is caught in a collective slowdown, touching everyone from buyers to sellers to builders," said Realtor.com Senior Economist Jake Krimmel. "Despite facing different pressures, each group is reacting the same way, with hesitation and retreat. The result is a market that can't gain meaningful traction. That being said, a more balanced market is emerging, creating opportunities for those with the patience and flexibility to adapt."</blockquote><p>Home sales remain near multi-decade lows, despite 21 consecutive months of rising inventory. In fact, inventory has grown 28% this summer alone (May 2025 - July 2025), reaching over 1 million homes for three straight months, and reaching the highest levels since Nov. 2019. Prices have stabilized in many regions, but elevated mortgage rates and economic uncertainty are keeping both buyers and sellers on the sidelines. The report finds that across the board, stakeholders are pulling back, leading to a housing market defined less by crisis and more by a collective pause.</p><h3 id="buyers-affordability-remains-out-of-reach">Buyers: Affordability Remains Out of Reach</h3><p>For buyers, affordability is still a major hurdle. The national median list price remains near $440,000, relatively unchanged since 2022, while mortgage rates have climbed, pushing monthly payments significantly higher. Compared to 2019, today's buyers are paying more than $1,200 more per month for the median-priced home, with costs rising due to both price growth and higher interest rates.</p><p>While incomes have grown, they have not kept pace with the increased cost of homeownership. Even in markets where prices have fallen, the “double whammy” of high rates and residual price appreciation has kept buying power low and sidelined many would-be buyers. In its recent Buying Power Report, Realtor.com found only 28.0% of homes on the market were priced within reach of the typical household, earning the U.S. median household income of $78,770.</p><h3 id="sellers-market-leverage-has-shifted">Sellers: Market Leverage Has Shifted</h3><p>Sellers are also navigating an interesting landscape. Although demand has cooled, many homeowners remain reluctant to lower prices. Instead, many are choosing to delist their homes entirely rather than budge on the price they have in their mind. The delisting-to-new listing ratio climbed to 0.21 in June 2025, up from 0.13 in May, which meant that for every 100 new listings, 21 were removed without a sale. In some metros, the ratio was even higher, such as Miami, where the delisting ratio was 59 per 100 new listings.</p><p>This dynamic, combined with a recent downturn in new listings, is slowing the pace of inventory growth. Sellers' resistance to price adjustments is contributing to stalled transactions and keeping prices elevated, further compounding affordability issues, the report stated.</p><h3 id="builders-slowing-activity-amid-rising-costs">Builders: Slowing Activity Amid Rising Costs</h3><p>Builders, too, are feeling the pressure. Single-family home construction is down, permits are falling, and the pipeline of new builds is shrinking. In June 2025, permits rose by 0.2% month over month but were 4.4% lower than last June. Starts rose by 4.6% from May 2025 but were still lower than in June 2024 (-0.5%).</p><p>Factors like high financing costs, weak buyer demand, and new tariffs on building materials have made developers increasingly cautious. This pullback comes at a time when the country is still short an estimated 4 million homes. Builders remain essential to solving the long-term supply gap, but current conditions are making it harder to justify new projects.</p><h3 id="regional-divergence-a-market-moving-in-opposite-directions">Regional Divergence: A Market Moving in Opposite Directions</h3><p>Adding complexity to the picture is a stark regional divide. In the South and West, supply has outpaced demand, leading to slower sales and price declines. As of July 2025, the South led the nation in housing supply, accounting for more than 50% of both new and existing home listings, outpacing its 39.4% share of U.S. households. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest remain tight markets, with resilient demand and limited inventory continuing to drive competition.</p><p>This regional fragmentation makes it harder to interpret national trends and underscores the importance of localized strategies for buyers, sellers, and policymakers alike.</p><h3 id="outlook-a-market-reset">Outlook: A Market Reset</h3><p>Despite these challenges, the housing market is not in crisis. Most homeowners are sitting on substantial equity. Many are locked into low interest rates. And while the pace of activity has slowed, the underlying fundamentals remain intact. As interest rates begin to ease and market participants adjust expectations, conditions for a healthier, more balanced market may gradually emerge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Even with modest improvements in mortgage rates, housing affordability, and inventory, buyers still remain hesitant.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales decreased by 0.4% in July from the prior month and rose 0.7% year-over-year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report released today (Aug. 28).</p><p>Pending sales declined month-over-month in the Northeast and Midwest, held essentially flat in the South, and rose in the West. Year-over-year, sales decreased in the Northeast and West but increased in the Midwest and South. July’s Realtors Confidence Index survey showed that 16% of NAR members expect an increase in buyer traffic over the next three months, unchanged from one year ago. Meanwhile, 21% expect an increase in seller traffic, up from 17% in July 2024.</p><blockquote>“Even with modest improvements in mortgage rates, housing affordability, and inventory, buyers still remain hesitant,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Buying a home is often the most expensive purchase people will make in their lives. This means that going under contract is not a decision homebuyers make quickly. Instead, people take their time to ensure the timing and home are right for them.”</blockquote><p>Yun added: “Rising mortgage applications for home purchase are an early indicator of more serious buyers in the marketplace, though many have not yet committed to a pending contract. The Federal Reserve signaling that they may enact a lower interest rate policy should steadily enlarge the pool of eligible homebuyers in the upcoming months.”</p><h3 id="july-2025-national-pending-home-sales">July 2025 National Pending Home Sales</h3><ul>

    <description><![CDATA[The New York metro region ranked No. 2 in terms of total value of homes with severe or extreme flood risk at $295.3 billion. Miami came in first place with $306.8 billion facing severe or extreme flood risk.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—More than one in four homes in the U.S.—representing $12.7 trillion in real estate value—are exposed to severe or extreme climate risks, according to a Realtor.com report released today (Sept. 3). The report states that flood, hurricane wind, and wildfire threats are reshaping housing markets, homeowner costs and insurance availability nationwide.</p><blockquote>“Climate risks are no longer a distant threat for U.S. housing—they are a present reality that put a large chunk of U.S. real estate value at risk,” said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com. “In many markets, the gap between perceived risk and actual risk is sizable, particularly for flooding. This has significant consequences for homeowners, buyers, and insurers, and it underscores the need for readily available data to help households make informed decisions.”</blockquote><h3 id="flood-risk-underestimated-and-growing">Flood Risk: Underestimated and Growing</h3><p>Flood risk is one of the most underestimated hazards in the housing market. Nearly 6.0 million homes, valued at $3.4 trillion, are likely to experience severe or extreme flooding over the next 30 years, according to First Street's Flood Factor score data found on Realtor.com. This figure is about two million higher than the number of homes located in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), largely because FEMA's maps do not fully reflect heavy rainfall or the effects of climate change.</p><p>Within the 100 largest metros, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco are the top metros where Realtor.com sees the biggest gap in dollar terms, between homes in FEMA SFHAs and homes facing severe or extreme flood risk, by $95.3 billion (New York), $65.6 billion (Los Angeles) and $54.9 billion (San Francisco).</p><p>By gap in share of market value, New Orleans leads the nation with 66 percentage points of its housing stock at severe or extreme flood risk but not identified by FEMA SFHAs, followed by Palm Bay, FL at 15 percentage points and Chattanooga, TN at 11 percentage points.</p><p>Coastal markets dominate the list of metro areas with the greatest dollar value and share of dollar value exposed to severe or extreme flood risk.</p><p>The New York metro region (New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ) ranked No. 2 in terms of total value of homes (9.9% market share) with severe or extreme flood risk at $295.3 billion. Miami came in first place with $306.8 billion facing severe or extreme flood risk.</p><h3 id="hurricane-wind-risk-entire-markets-at-stake">Hurricane Wind Risk: Entire Markets at Stake</h3><p>In 2025, approximately 18.3% of homes in the United States, valued at nearly $8.0 trillion, face severe or extreme risk of wind damage, according to First Street's Wind Factor score data available on Realtor.com. In 14 major metros across Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, and Texas—including Miami, Houston, Tampa, and New Orleans—every home is exposed to severe or extreme risk of wind damage. Because these risks frequently overlap with flood exposure, homeowners in coastal markets face compounded threats. Financially, the burden is amplified by high hurricane deductibles; in many states, homeowners with a $400,000 policy may need to cover as much as $20,000 in damage before insurance kicks in.</p><p>The New York metro region came in third with $545.6 billion in total home value (18.3% market share) facing severe or extreme wind risk. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL market once again came in first with $1.32 billion in home value (100% market share) facing severe or extreme wind risk, followed by the Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands, TX market at $764.3 billion in home value facing wind damage risk.</p><h3 id="wildfire-risk-concentrated-but-intensifying">Wildfire Risk: Concentrated but Intensifying</h3><p>Wildfire exposure, while geographically concentrated, represents a significant and growing challenge. In 2025, 5.6% of homes, worth $3.2 trillion, face severe or extreme wildfire risk, according to First Street Fire Factor score data available on Realtor.com. California alone accounts for nearly 40% of this total, or $1.8 trillion in property value, with Los Angeles and Riverside among the most exposed metros. The state's insurance market is under severe stress: California's FAIR Plan, designed as a last-resort option, has grown to $650 billion in total exposure, up 289% since 2021.</p><p>Outside California, wildfire risk is also acute in western metros such as Colorado Springs, CO where more than three-quarters of home value is vulnerable, and Tucson, AZ where 60% of housing stock faces high fire danger.</p><h3 id="insurance-costs-rising-and-uneven">Insurance Costs: Rising and Uneven</h3><p>Rising insurance costs are amplifying the financial strain on homeowners in these high-risk areas. In Miami, for single-family homeowners under a HO-3 policy, the most common type of homeowners insurance policy in the U.S., the typical homeowner now pays annual premiums equal to 3.7% of the home's market value—the highest ratio among the nation's 100 largest metros.</p><p>New Orleans follows closely at 3.6 percent, with Cape Coral, FL, at 2.2%. Florida cities dominate the list of expensive insurance markets, with Tampa, Palm Bay, and North Port all ranking among the top ten. These burdens come on top of structural gaps in coverage: flood insurance is typically sold separately, hurricane deductibles are significantly higher than standard policies, and wildfire coverage in many regions is either limited or unaffordable</p><blockquote>"Climate risk and insurance are not usually a top consideration for home shoppers balancing budgets against still-high home prices and mortgage rates, but these factors already shape ongoing housing costs and affordability, and increasingly whether they can secure affordable insurance coverage," said Hale. "While the types of risk vary by region—flooding in the Northeast, wildfires in the West, and hurricanes in the South—the financial consequences are increasingly national in scope."</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[This incentive has long been a vital program support. By offsetting potential vacancy costs while applications are pending it makes landlords more willing to participate in CityFHEPS.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a significant shift, New York City has reversed course on its plan to eliminate a key CityFHEPS (the City Fighting Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement) landlord incentive—the payment of one month’s rent to hold a unit for voucher tenants while applications are processed. This policy reversal comes after legal challenges, and now the rule change will go through public review under the City Administrative Procedure Act (CAPA)—a win for due process and housing stability. </p><h3 id="what-changed-and-why-it-matters">What Changed and Why it Matters</h3><p>In late May, the Department of Social Services (DSS) notified stakeholders that it planned to eliminate the “unit hold” incentive, citing expected processing improvements from new systems. But advocates and Legal Aid questioned the move—arguing it sidestepped required public notice and process.</p><p>A court granted a temporary restraining order in late June, followed by an injunction blocking the change, and mandated it go through CAPA. Now, if adopted, there will be at least 60 days for public feedback before any elimination takes effect—and until then, the incentive remains in place.</p><p>This incentive has long been a vital program support. By offsetting potential vacancy costs while applications are pending it makes landlords more willing to participate in CityFHEPS. Without it, brokers and property owners say the already complex program could lose further traction—hampering housing access for voucher holders.</p><p>In FY 2025, CityFHEPS grew substantially, assisting more than 15,000 households moving into housing, for a total of nearly 59,000 households supported—up 17% from the previous year.</p><h3 id="why-realtors-should-pay-attention">Why Realtors Should Pay Attention</h3><ul>
<li>The stability and usability of CityFHEPS directly affect brokers, landlords, and tenants alike.</li>
<li>Consistency in program rules matters. Sudden shifts without public notice make planning and advising clients harder.</li>
<li>The one-month “unit hold” helps preserve listing availability and protects owner revenue during often-lengthy application reviews.</li>
<li>Ensuring CityFHEPS remains a viable path to stable rentals preserves housing access for low-income populations and maintains a critical bridge between shelters and permanent housing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s Next?</h3><p>DSS intends to begin the CAPA public hearing process imminently, as per remarks by the City Law Department in court.</p><p>After the review—and pending outcome—the rule may remain, be modified, or be eliminated. But until then, the incentive stays intact.</p><p>Legal Aid and advocates have pledged to continue challenging any removal of the incentive as “arbitrary and capricious.”</p><h3 id="next-steps-for-realtors">Next Steps for Realtors</h3><p>HGAR’s Government Affairs team will continue to monitor the CAPA process closely and keep members informed about next steps. As Realtors, our role is not only to connect clients with housing, but also to advocate for policies that ensure programs like CityFHEPS are workable, transparent and sustainable. Together, we can help shape a housing system that supports stability for families, protects owner investments and strengthens New York’s housing market.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[At the metro level, seven of the 50 largest U.S. markets were in buyer’s market territory in June with six months or more of supply: Miami, Austin, Orlando, New York, Jacksonville, Tampa, and Riverside, CA.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—The U.S. housing market reached a rare state of balance this summer, according to Realtor.com's August monthly housing report released on Sept. 9, which showed months of supply at 5.0, a level not seen in the summer months since Realtor.com began tracking the metric in 2016.</p><p>This shift signals the continuation of a slow rebalancing in favor of homebuyers, though local conditions vary significantly across regions and metros, the report stated.</p><blockquote>“The national housing market is now more balanced between homebuyers and sellers at five months of supply, but that balance conceals a wide range of local realities,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “In Miami, Austin, and Orlando, buyers are clearly in control, while in metros like Milwaukee and Boston, sellers remain firmly in the driver's seat. The takeaway for buyers and sellers alike is that local conditions, not national headlines, are what matter most for pricing, competition, and timing.”</blockquote><p>Formally, months of supply is defined as a month's total inventory — both active and pending listings — divided by sales in that month. In theory, it represents how long it would take to sell all currently listed homes at the current sales pace. In practice, the metric is a long-standing rule of thumb: fewer than 4.0 months indicates a seller's market, 4–6 months is balanced, and 6+ months favors buyers.</p><h3 id="metros-split-along-buyer-seller-spectrum">Metros Split Along Buyer-Seller Spectrum</h3><p>At the metro level, seven of the 50 largest U.S. markets were in buyer's market territory in June with six months or more of supply: Miami, Austin, Orlando, New York, Jacksonville, Tampa, and Riverside, CA. Every major metro in this category also saw prices fall in August on a per-square-foot basis.</p><p><strong>Buyers' Markets</strong>—Highest months of supply metros (June): Miami (9.7), Austin (7.1), Orlando (6.9), New York (6.7), Jacksonville (6.3), Tampa (6.3), and Riverside, CA (6.1).</p><p><strong>Balanced metros near the national average</strong>—Los Angeles (5.0), Denver (4.9), Portland, Ore. (5.1).</p><p><strong>Sellers' Markets</strong>—Lowest months of supply metros: Milwaukee (2.7), St. Louis (2.9), Grand Rapids, MI (2.9), Boston (3.0).</p><p>Markets with greater than six months' supply experienced price declines in August, while those with fewer than four months of supply recorded stronger price growth. The divergence is highly regional: Southern markets—particularly in Florida and Texas—dominate the buyer's market group, while most of the Northeast and Midwest remain in tight seller's market territory with steady or rising prices. Notably, buyer's market regions also align to areas where builders have been more active and new homes are more abundant.</p><h3 id="inventory-recovery-stalls-after-two-years-of-growth">Inventory Recovery Stalls After Two Years of Growth</h3><p>For buyers, a growing number of homes for sale continues to shape the market. Active listings rose 20.9% year-over-year in August, marking the 22nd consecutive month of gains and the fourth straight month above 1 million listings.</p><p>But that expansion is slowing. Active listing growth has decelerated each month since May, when it reached 31.5% year-over-year. The gap to pre-pandemic inventory has also widened again, now sitting 14.3% below 2017–2019 norms—up from 12.9% in June. In other words, the nationwide inventory recovery is moving in the wrong direction.</p><p>By region, inventory rose in all four major U.S. regions, led by the West (+26.7%) and South (+21.8%), with slower growth in the Midwest (+15.6%) and Northeast (+14.2%).</p><p>Relative to pre-pandemic norms, only the South (+3.6%) and West (+6.6%) are running above 2017–2019 levels. The Midwest (-39.3%) and Northeast (-50.9%) continue to lag significantly.</p><p>Metros above pre-pandemic levels by 25%—11 of the top 50 all concentrated in the South and West. Denver (+64.2%), San Antonio (+53.4%), and Austin (+50.2%) lead the list.</p><h3 id="delistings-signal-growing-seller-frustration">Delistings Signal Growing Seller Frustration</h3><p>Beyond slowing sales and flat prices, delistings have become a defining feature of this summer's housing market. Nationally, delistings rose 57% in July, which is the most recent month for which delisting data is available, compared to the same time last year, continuing a sharp upward trend that has now outpaced overall inventory gains. On a year-to-date basis, delistings are up 41%.</p><p>The ratio of delistings to new listings—a metric that captures the flow of homes in and out of the for-sale market—climbed to 0.24 in July. This means that for every 100 new listings that came onto the market, 24 previously listed homes were removed without selling. By comparison, the ratio was just 0.17 a year ago.</p><p>Metros with the highest delisting-to-listing ratios (July): Miami (57 per 100 new listings), Phoenix (45), Riverside, CA (34) and Tucson, AZ (33).</p><p>A rising delisting rate suggests that sellers are increasingly unwilling to accept current market prices or conditions, pulling their homes from the market instead. This pullback could put downward pressure on inventory later in the year, reducing buyer choice even as market momentum slows.</p><h3 id="softer-demand-meets-slower-sales">Softer Demand Meets Slower Sales</h3><p>Signs of a cooling market are evident in demand-side indicators. Pending home sales dipped 1.3% year-over-year in August, while new listings grew just 4.9%—marking the fourth straight month of slowing momentum.</p><p>Homes are also taking longer to sell. The typical home spent 60 days on the market in August, seven days longer than last year and now above pre-pandemic norms for the second consecutive month. This was the 17th straight month of year-over-year increases in time on market.</p><p>Regionally, the slowdown is most pronounced in the South and West. Compared to last year, time on market rose by eight days in the West and the South, versus three in the Midwest and two in the Northeast. Twenty-seven of the top 50 metros are now seeing listings linger longer than their pre-pandemic averages, with the sharpest slowdowns in Nashville (+21 days) and Miami (+16 days).</p><h3 id="prices-hold-flat-but-cuts-rising">Prices Hold Flat, But Cuts Rising</h3><p>The national median list price remained unchanged from last year at $429,990, down 2.2% month-over-month. Year-on-year prices varied modestly by region, ticking up slightly in the Northeast (+1.1%), remaining steady in the Midwest (+0.0%) and South (-0.1%), and edging lower in the West (-2.1%)</p><p>Sellers are adjusting to weaker demand. In August, 20.3% of active listings had price cuts, with reductions concentrated in the South and West. Delistings also rose sharply—\up 57% year-over-year — as more sellers pulled homes off the market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[While the program is well-intentioned, the economics remain challenging.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York City recently rolled out the “Unlocking Doors Program,” which aims to encourage landlords to bring long-vacant rent-stabilized apartments back onto the market. The program now offers up to $50,000 per unit in renovation reimbursements, doubling its initial $25,000 incentive in an effort to attract more participation. </p><p>To qualify, apartments must have capped rents generally no more than $1,200 for a one-bedroom and $1,400 for a three-bedroom. Units that meet these criteria are uncommon, typically becoming available only when longtime tenants move out after decades in the same apartment. Even with repairs, landlords face tight restrictions on how much they can increase rent each year, or after completing renovations, making it difficult to recover the investment.</p><p>While the program is well-intentioned, the economics remain challenging. In many cases, property owners would have to re-rent apartments for a few hundred dollars per month after investing tens of thousands in repairs. Meanwhile, operating costs including taxes, insurance, utilities, and compliance with local safety and energy mandates often far exceed the rent, leaving landlords to shoulder ongoing losses.</p><p>This isn’t about landlords seeking higher profits; it’s about covering the basic cost of providing housing. No other industry is expected to sell a product below its cost of production, yet housing providers are often placed in that position.</p><p>The risks extend beyond finances. Owners must still manage the possibility of non-payment, meet regulatory and compliance obligations, and remain responsible for tenant safety. None of these responsibilities go away simply because the rent does not cover costs.</p><p>For Realtors and housing providers, the consequences are clear. Vacant units remain offline. Communities lose access to stable housing and the broader market suffers when policy fails to account for the real-world economics of property ownership.</p><p>HGAR supports the city’s goal of returning apartments to the market. However, as currently structured, this program is unlikely to achieve widespread participation. Without policies that align allowable rents with operating costs and share risk more equitably, landlords cannot be expected to absorb indefinite losses.</p><p>Our position is straightforward: affordability and sustainability must go hand-in-hand. HGAR will continue to work with policymakers to ensure that housing programs reflect economic realities and meet the needs of both communities and property owners.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY—The August 2025 housing market across the OneKey MLS regional coverage area demonstrated steady momentum, with notable month-over-month price gains in several counties despite a modest dip in overall closed sales.</p><p>According to the latest data released on Oct. 11 by OneKey MLS, the median sales price for single-family homes rose 5.3% year-over-year to $774,000, while the overall median price for all property types climbed 5.2% to $710,000. Days on market continued to decline, now averaging just 40 days for single-family homes, signaling sustained buyer demand.</p><p>Month-over-month comparisons revealed significant regional variation. Sullivan County led the surge with a 16.4% jump in median home prices, followed by Putnam County with an 11.3% increase. Dutchess, Nassau, and Suffolk counties also posted gains between 1.7% and 4.9%.</p><p>In contrast, Westchester and Rockland counties saw price declines of 4.3% and 7.1%, respectively, suggesting a possible seasonal adjustment or buyer pushback at higher price points.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/09/onekey-graphic1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1624" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/onekey-graphic1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/onekey-graphic1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/09/onekey-graphic1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/09/onekey-graphic1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Closed sales across all property types dipped 2.8% from July, with single-family homes down 2.5%, condos down 3.4%, and co-ops down 4.1%. Inventory levels also contracted slightly, with single-family listings down 3.3% month-over-month, contributing to tighter market conditions.</p><blockquote>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, commented: "While we’re seeing some cooling in transaction volume, the upward pressure on prices—especially in more affordable counties—reflects a market still driven by demand and limited inventory. Buyers are recalibrating, and sellers are adjusting expectations, but the fundamentals remain strong.”</blockquote><p>He continued, “The regional diversity in pricing trends underscores the importance of hyperlocal market knowledge for both consumers and professionals.”</p><p>For complete access to all our housing market reports and interactive tools, visit marketstats.onekeymls.com.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The Planning Board closed the public hearing, which signals a vote on the project’s site plan application and height exemption could come at the Planning Board’s next scheduled meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 8.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SLATE HILL—The $607-million proposal to build a 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon distribution facility here has cleared a key hurdle and is likely facing a critical vote in early October that will determine its fate.</p><p>The Wawayanda Planning Board held a public hearing on Sept. 10 on a height exemption to the existing project’s amended site plan. A number of residents and non-residents argued against approval of Scannell Development’s requested height exemption while representatives of the building trades and business groups, including the Orange County Partnership, testified in favor of the needed height exemption to its site plan. The Planning Board eventually closed the public hearing, which signals a vote on the project’s site plan application and height exemption could come at the Planning Board’s next scheduled meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 8.</p><p>On June 12, the Town of Wawayanda’s Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously (4-0) to reject a needed height variance for the Amazon project. While some observers indicated the project was killed by the ZBA, neither Amazon nor Scannell officially withdrew the project. Instead, Scannell officials told the Wawayanda Planning Board last month (Aug. 13) that Town Code 195-13 specifically allows for a project to be granted a height exemption if its fire-fighting capacity is sufficient and if its property buffers are greater than required. See <a href="https://realestateindepth.com/breaking-news-its-back-massive-amazon-distribution-project-reemerges-seeking-height-exemption/">https://realestateindepth.com/breaking-news-its-back-massive-amazon-distribution-project-reemerges-seeking-height-exemption/</a></p><p>Matt Boone, development manager of Indianapolis, IN-based Scannell Properties, testified before the Planning Board last month that the project meets both exemption requirements and that its fire suppression system had recently been approved by the Department of State. In terms of setbacks, Boone noted that the project offers setbacks that are anywhere between 650% to 2,000% greater than the setback requirements by the town. The Planning Board later granted the request for the Sept. 10 public hearing and a referral for the height matter to be reviewed by the Orange County Planning Department. Boone reiterated those points to the Planning Board at the Sept. 10th session.</p><p>The Scannell project, also known as “Project Bluebird,” had already received a favorable negative declaration by the Planning Board on June 11 on its requested special use permit, but the project failed to garner the necessary height variance (from 35 feet to approximately 66 feet) from the ZBA the following night to allow it to proceed any further.</p><p>The controversial project proposed by a partnership of Scannell Properties and Amazon Services, LLC, is considered to be among the largest ever private investment ventures in Orange County. The plan calls for the construction of a five-story, 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon robotic fulfillment/distribution center in Slate Hill. Each floor (two below grade and three above grade) would total approximately 600,000 square feet. The project is also under review by the Orange County Industrial Development Agency for possible financial incentives.</p><p><em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> has also learned that Scannell Development and the property owner Aden Slate Hill, LLC filed an Article 78 proceeding on July 24 in New York State Supreme Court in Orange County against the Town of Wawayanda and the town’s Zoning Board of Appeals and is seeking to have the ZBA’s denial vote annulled and have the court compel the ZBA to approve Scannell’s height variance. Among its charges contained in the lawsuit, Scannell noted that the ZBA previously approved a similar height variance to Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) energy plant.</p><p>The Town of Wawayanda and ZBA have denied allegations contained in Scannell’s Article 78 proceeding and are seeking to have the court dismiss the litigation against both the Town of Wawayanda and its ZBA.</p><p>Back in 2023, Scannell and Amazon secured approvals for a 900,000-square-foot warehouse at the 22 McBride Road site, but eventually submitted a much larger proposal. The 100-acre property is currently an active quarry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[NAR has now launched the Pro-Property Platform, a system designed to strengthen federal political advocacy by allowing direct-to-candidate contributions to be tagged as pro-housing and pro-property rights.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Politics in Washington is as unsettled as ever. Shifting priorities, constant debate, and competing visions for the future of the country have created a landscape that changes almost daily. While this environment can be refreshing for some and disruptive for others, the challenges facing Realtors and the real estate industry remain constant. </p><p>From addressing the nation’s 4.7-million-unit housing shortage to protecting the right to work as independent contractors, our core issues do not disappear with each new political cycle. That is why the National Association of Realtors, the New York State Association of Realtors, and HGAR’s Government Affairs team continue to focus on advancing solutions, no matter the climate.</p><p>Recent efforts have already produced results. Locally, HGAR worked with Congressman Mike Lawler (NY-17) to push forward changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a long-standing priority for homeowners in New York. At the same time, Realtors are strengthening their influence by enhancing political giving. RPAC—the Realtors Political Action Committee—remains the cornerstone of Realtor advocacy, uniting the industry, supporting champions in office, and ensuring our collective voice is heard.</p><p>Building on this foundation, NAR has now launched the Pro-Property Platform, a system designed to strengthen federal political advocacy by allowing direct-to-candidate contributions to be tagged as pro-housing and pro-property rights. The platform does not replace RPAC. Instead, it complements it by capturing donations Realtors and their networks are already making, often through candidate websites that previously carried no Realtor message.</p><p>The platform is open not only to Realtors, but also to NAR affiliates, clients, family, friends, and consumers. In this way, it extends Realtor advocacy into the broader community of people who care about housing. Donors also have the flexibility to choose which candidates to support. At present, 21 members of Congress from New York are listed on the platform, including Mike Lawler (NY-17), Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Pat Ryan (NY-18), and Richie Torres (NY-15).</p><p>Although contributions through the Pro-Property Platform do not count toward annual RPAC goals, they do count toward a member’s RPAC Lifetime Giving total, which is nationally recognized. At this early stage, NAR has not set fundraising goals for the program. The emphasis is on learning—testing what works, identifying new opportunities, and determining how best the platform can complement existing efforts. Formal benchmarks are expected to be considered in the next election cycle, once there is more data and experience to draw on.</p><p>The timing of this program is significant. With next year’s midterm elections approaching, every member of Congress will be on the ballot. This is the period when lawmakers are most attentive to voters and the industries they represent. The Pro-Property Platform ensures that Realtors can take advantage of this moment, uniting their message and amplifying their impact at a time when it is most likely to be heard.</p><p>As political intensity continues to build at the state and federal levels, Realtors will need to stay visible and engaged. RPAC, and now the Pro-Property Platform, provide the tools to do just that. Together, they allow us to cut through the noise of partisanship, connect directly with decision-makers, and advocate for policies that strengthen housing, property rights, and homeownership. While politics will continue to shift, our issues remain steady. There are elected officials who agree with us and those who do not, but we have champions on both sides of the aisle. By continuing to build our advocacy through RPAC and embracing new tools like the Pro-Property Platform, Realtors ensure that housing stays at the center of the national conversation, no matter which way the political winds may blow.</p><p>To our RPAC supporters at HGAR, thank you. Your commitment has allowed us to build on your investment, strengthen our voice, and expand our influence with elected leaders. Because of your support, our industry is better protected and better positioned to meet the challenges ahead. We are excited about new tools like the Pro-Property Platform, which will enhance Realtor giving and amplify our impact even further.</p><p>If you have not yet experienced the power of RPAC, now is the time to get involved. With so many ways to make your contribution count—and with so much at stake—this is not the moment to sit on the sidelines. Your industry needs your support, your involvement, and your voice. Together, we will ensure that Realtors remain a strong, united force for housing, property rights, and the communities we serve.</p><p>And there’s no better way to get involved than by joining us at IMPACT and our special RPAC Lunch. Be sure to get your ticket today for the event to be held on Monday, Sept. 29, at the Sonesta Hotel in White Plains. HGAR’s RPAC team will have a table at IMPACT with information on all that RPAC has accomplished for you, RPAC swag for sale, and much more—including a dedicated RPAC lunch. We hope to see you there.</p><p>To stay connected, join our RPAC Facebook page for updates on upcoming events. You can also visit our Advocacy Page on our website to learn more about HGAR’s priorities and how you can participate in both <a href="https://www.hgar.com/who-we-are/political-advocacy/rpac-invest-now" rel="noreferrer">RPAC and the Pro-Property Platform</a>.</p><p><em>About the author: Alexander Roithmayr is Director of Government Affairs for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YONKERS—The Community Advisory Committee will meet on Thursday, Sept. 25 to determine the fate of the $2.3-billion MGM Empire Casino proposal in Yonkers. An affirmative vote allows the project to advance for consideration with the New York State Gaming Commission Facility Location Board. A negative vote kills the proposal and for at least some observers, could spell the eventual closure of the Empire City Casino complex in the coming years.</p><p>James Cavanaugh, the chairman of the five-member CAC, reported at the project’s second public hearing last night (Sept. 16) that the CAC will meet on Thursday, Sept. 25 at the Yonkers Riverfront Library at 10 a.m. where it will likely vote on whether to approve or disapprove the MGM Empire City plan.</p><p>MGM Empire City was one of seven applicants vying for as many as three downstate full casino gaming licenses to be awarded before Dec 31 by the New York State Gaming Commission. All seven projects were in various stages of the Community Advisory Committee process. However, after this morning’s two CAC votes, there are now just six players left vying for up to three coveted downstate casino licenses.</p><p>The CACs for SL Green Realty’s $5-billion Caesars Palace Times Square at 1515 Broadway and The Avenir at 11th Avenue and 41st Street in Manhattan both respectively held their final votes earlier today. The Caesars Palace Times Square CAC rejected the project’s application for community approval by a 4-2 vote, thus ending its bid for a casino license by the Gaming Commission. The Avenir, which was led by Silverstein Properties, Rush Street Gaming, and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, met the same fate as its CAC voted 4-2 today to reject the estimated $7-billion plan, thus killing that project as well and brining the contestants for the three gaming licenses down to six — MGM Empire City (Yonkers), Resorts World New York City (Queens), Bally’s Bronx, The Coney (Brooklyn), Metropolitan Park (Queens) and the last remaining Manhattan proposal Freedom Plaza at 686 1st Avenue.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/09/Caesars-Time-Square.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="627" height="451" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/Caesars-Time-Square.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/09/Caesars-Time-Square.png 627w"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">An aerial rendering of the Caesars Times Square project in Manhattan.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>The Community Advisory Committee for the Bally’s in the Bronx has held two public hearings, but on Sept. 15 submitted a nine-page proposal and amendments including the establishment of a Community Benefit Fund Board. At present, a final vote on the Bally’s Bronx Casino and Resort has not been scheduled, according to the Gaming Commission website.</p><p>The CACs for The Coney casino proposal in Brooklyn, the Freedom Plaza in Manhattan, Resorts World New York City and Metropolitan Park in Queens have all held two public hearings but have not scheduled a meeting for a final vote. The CACs have until Sept. 30 to vote on the respective proposals.</p><p>The two existing racinos (featuring Video Lottery Terminals) downstate are Empire City Casino in Yonkers and Resorts World New York City in Queens.</p><p>Earlier this month, Taryn Duffy, president and CEO of Tarsam Public Affairs and former Vice President of Public Affairs, MGM Resorts Northeast Group, gave a virtual presentation on the merits of the MGM Yonkers project to HGAR members.</p><p>Duffy urged HGAR to support the proposal that would generate approximately 6,500 construction workers and add more than 2,000 new permanent jobs to the facility once operational.</p><p>The Sept. 16 CAC meeting held at the Yonkers Montessori Academy featured a vast majority of supporters of the project that included Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano, as well as some Yonkers residents, members of the building trades and employees of the existing Empire City MGM Casino. Those who testified against the project were mostly Yonkers residents who live near the project who complained about increases in traffic and persistent flooding issues surrounding the property and in the adjoining neighborhood.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/09/The-Avenir-rendering.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1503" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/The-Avenir-rendering.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/The-Avenir-rendering.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/09/The-Avenir-rendering.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/09/The-Avenir-rendering.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The $7-billion The Avenir was rejected by its Community Advisory Committee earlier today by a 4-2 vote.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Yonkers Mayor Spano spoke of the economic fallout that would come if the CAC voted against the MGM Empire Casino plan. The mayor in his testimony chronicled the economic benefits the project would bring to Yonkers and the region and speculated that if Empire City was not granted a full gaming license, the facility could not compete with other downstate casinos and would likely close sometime in the future.</p><p>John Cooney, Jr., executive director of the Tarrytown-based Construction Industry Council of Westchester &amp; Hudson Valley, Inc. echoed the mayor’s position on the negative impacts a rejection of Empire City’s plan would have on the local economy in an op-ed published in the<em> Journal News</em> on Sept. 16.</p><blockquote>“Awarding full casino licenses to three other downstate entities would seal Empire City’s fate. Without its own license, the property would be forced to compete against full-scale casinos in its market while facing additional pressure from an anticipated mega-casino at the Meadowlands, just 20 miles away. There is no viable future for Empire City under those conditions,” Mr. Cooney predicted.</blockquote><p>He continued, “The result would be the eventual closure of MGM Empire City that would eliminate 700 permanent jobs; the loss of $88 million in annual wages; local vendors, within a 20-mile radius, would lose $30 million in annual revenue; and, New York’s public schools would lose $300 million in funding annually. This isn’t just a lost opportunity, it’s an economic catastrophe waiting to happen,” Cooney warned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[For HGAR, participation at Turning Stone reflects our commitment to being a leader in these conversations.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, HGAR leadership and staff traveled to Turning Stone for the New York State Association of Realtors (NYSAR) Fall Business Meetings, where Realtors and association leaders from across the state convened for several days of collaboration, strategy, and advocacy. These annual gatherings serve as a cornerstone of our statewide network, providing a venue to align priorities, advance policies, and strengthen the Realtor voice in New York. </p><h3 id="why-these-meetings-matter">Why These Meetings Matter</h3><p>The real estate industry is undergoing profound shifts from evolving housing policies to new regulatory mandates that impact both property owners and the professionals who serve them. At times like these, it is essential that our members’ voices are not only heard but amplified at the state level. The Fall Business Meetings brought together local associations, committees, and working groups to coordinate advocacy strategies and share best practices that protect property rights and promote housing opportunity.</p><p>For HGAR, participation at Turning Stone reflects our commitment to being a leader in these conversations. Our presence ensures that the unique perspectives of our members are represented as decisions are being shaped at the statewide level.</p><h3 id="key-themes-from-the-meetings">Key Themes from the Meetings</h3><p>Throughout the week, several themes stood out that will shape the months ahead:</p><p>Advocacy and Legislative Priorities: Realtors from across the state engaged in discussions about upcoming challenges in Albany and New York City. Issues such as affordability, fair housing, and regulatory compliance remain top of mind for our industry.</p><p>Fair Housing and Professional Standards: Committees reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening fair housing enforcement and raising the bar on professional standards. These conversations remind us that protecting consumers and ensuring equity are central to our mission as Realtors.</p><p>Member Engagement and Education: Sessions also focused on enhancing member engagement, investing in leadership development, and providing timely market insights. At HGAR, we continue to prioritize delivering value to our members through education and advocacy.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3><p>As we return from Turning Stone, the real work begins bringing these insights and initiatives back to our members and ensuring they are prepared for what’s ahead. The next several months will be pivotal, not just for New York City, but for the broader housing market across the state. Policy decisions being made today will shape the environment Realtors operate in for years to come.</p><p>HGAR remains dedicated to leading on these issues, advocating for our members, and ensuring that housing opportunities remain accessible, fair, and sustainable.</p><h3 id="call-to-action-join-us-october-6th">Call to Action: Join Us October 6th</h3><p>We encourage all members to stay engaged with our updates and advocacy initiatives and the best way to do that is to join us for our Legislative Breakfast on October 6th. This event will bring together elected officials, industry leaders, and Realtors to discuss the future of housing and the policies that directly impact your business. It’s an opportunity not only to hear from decision-makers, but also to make your voice heard.</p><p>The event will be held at the Residence Inn by Marriott New York, The Bronx Metro Center Atrium, located at 1776 Eastchester Road. The program will begin at 8 a.m. with breakfast and a Meet and Greet, followed at 9 a.m. with a panel discussion.</p><p>Our strength as Realtors lies in our ability to come together, stay informed, and act decisively. The Fall Business Meetings at Turning Stone served as an important reminder of that strength, and HGAR is proud to be carrying that momentum forward on behalf of our members.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[HPPA makes several pivotal legal changes governing when, how, and to whom credit reports may be shared in the mortgage and insurance context.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sept. 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act (“HPPA” or “Act”) (see <a href="http://bit.ly/4n12e0e">http://bit.ly/4n12e0e</a>), which takes effect on March 5, 2026. This bipartisan legislation represents a major development in consumer privacy law and directly affects real estate professionals, attorneys, mortgage lenders, and buyers. The act officially implements significant curbs on the controversial practice of “trigger leads.” Advocates, lenders, and consumer groups hailed the move as a landmark victory for privacy, transparency, and greater control for prospective homeowners. The HPPA makes several significant changes to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) (see <a href="http://bit.ly/41PK8Gi">http://bit.ly/41PK8Gi</a>).</p><h3 id="what-are-%E2%80%98trigger-leads%E2%80%99-and-why-are-they-problematic">What are ‘Trigger Leads’ and Why are They Problematic?</h3><p>The act restricts the use of “trigger leads,” which are credit report alerts generated when a consumer applies for a mortgage or insurance coverage. When consumers apply for a loan or apply for insurance, the lender or insurance company customarily requests their credit report from a credit reporting agency (CRA). These CRAs then generate lists of all individual credit inquiries made in the context of a residential mortgage application or insurance application.</p><p>CRAs then sell this list to third parties, usually other lenders, mortgage brokers, insurance companies, and insurance brokers, who use the data to reach out directly to the consumer. These CRAs generate these trigger leads almost immediately, without the knowledge or consent of the consumers. For years, the sale of trigger leads to third-party lenders and brokers has resulted in a flood of unsolicited calls, emails, texts, and mail solicitations directed at buyers. While marketed as “competitive offers,” these practices often created confusion, frustration and opportunities for fraud.</p><p>For home buyers, the consequences are all too familiar: within hours or days of applying for a loan, they may be inundated with unsolicited calls, emails, text messages, and even unsolicited mail offers from multiple lenders, many of whom they have never contacted or expressed interest in working with. These contacts are intrusive, overwhelming, and confusing, especially amid what should be a mindful, deliberative process of evaluating loan and/or insurance options by consumers.</p><p>Consumer-advocacy groups argue that trigger leads can facilitate predatory or deceptive marketing, particularly targeting more vulnerable populations, including older adults, minority groups, first-time home buyers and other groups. AARP, for instance, highlighted how older homebuyers may receive postcards or calls that appear to come from their real estate agent or lender, but are in fact marketing campaigns that push unnecessary products or services.</p><h3 id="legislative-journey-and-political-alignment">Legislative Journey and Political Alignment</h3><p>Introduced in the House by Representatives John Rose (R-TN) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY), the bill received bipartisan sponsorship and enjoyed strong support in both chambers. It passed the House Financial Services Committee unanimously (46-0) on June 10, 2025, then the House by voice-vote on June 23, and ultimately cleared the Senate by unanimous consent on August 2. This legislation is particularly notable during these politically divisive times. It is important, now more than ever, for our nation’s political leaders to come together and continue to find common ground and pass consequential legislation that protects Americans.</p><h3 id="core-provisions-of-the-hppa">Core Provisions of the HPPA</h3><p>HPPA makes several pivotal legal changes governing when, how, and to whom credit reports may be shared in the mortgage and insurance context. First, it implements restrictions on the ability of CRAs to share credit reports. CRAs are prohibited from providing a consumer’s credit report to third parties in connection with a residential mortgage transaction or application for an insurance product. A CRA may share a report only when either:</p><ul>
<li>The third party provides documentation certifying that it has the consumer’s consent, or</li>
<li>The third party is the consumer’s current mortgage originator, current loan servicer, or has a current banking or insurance relationship with the consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, before a CRA may share “trigger leads,” there is a requirement that there must be a “firm offer” based on a concrete pre-qualified offer, not simply speculative marketing. The effective date of the act is March 5, 2026.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-homebuyers">What This Means for Homebuyers</h3><p>The act will provide consumers with greater privacy and control over their personal information. Consumers will no longer be bombarded by unsolicited offers triggered automatically by a new mortgage application. Only entities with consent or a prior relationship may contact them.</p><p>The HPPA will hopefully make the homebuying process, which is already incredibly stressful, much smoother by eliminating unwanted solicitations and reducing confusion about the legitimacy of those companies that are reaching out.</p><p>The law should also establish stronger protection from fraud and scams. With fewer unknown actors contacting homebuyers, there is a reduced risk of deceptive offers, scams, or misleading marketing masquerading as official communications.</p><h3 id="implications-for-the-mortgage-and-insurance-industries">Implications for the Mortgage and Insurance Industries</h3><p>While HPPA curbs certain lead-generation practices and the use of “trigger leads,” it does not eliminate legitimate competition. Lenders, insurance companies, and related brokers must now rely on traditional methods, such as direct referrals or marketing to existing customers, rather than automatically utilizing trigger leads to mass-contact new prospects without their consent.</p><p>The act also forces a shift toward increased trust and transparency. Lenders and insurance companies that emphasize honest communication, clear disclosures, and relationship-based marketing will certainly gain an edge as consumers become more discerning. It is also important for these companies to be aware of and to implement operational and compliance adjustments by March 5, 2026. Credit bureaus, lenders, insurance companies, and data vendors must adjust workflows, contracts, and legal compliance measures to ensure they do not accidentally violate the new statute.</p><h3 id="industry-stakeholders-herald-the-hppa">Industry Stakeholders Herald the HPPA</h3><p>The National Association of Realtors (NAR) celebrated the law as “a win for transparency, consumer control, and privacy in the mortgage process.” Executive leadership emphasized its importance in halting a practice that “bombards homebuyers” at a pivotal moment. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) framed the law as a shield against deceptive practices, misleading offers, and predatory marketing, targeting older and potentially more vulnerable homebuyers.</p><p>The Financial Services Committee and lawmakers, particularly Committee Chair French Hill (R-AR), noted that the law “protects homebuyers’ personal financial information, while encouraging competition and choice in the mortgage market.” Co-sponsors and supporters across party lines echoed its balanced, consumer-friendly nature.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead-what-consumers-should-know">Looking Ahead: What Consumers Should Know</h3><p>It is important to note that until the law goes into effect on March 5, 2026, existing “trigger-lead” practices remain in force and consumers need to be aware of this practice. While consumers and industry stakeholders have six months to prepare, consumers can act now to protect their private information from being sold without their consent or knowledge. Consumers may opt out of pre-screened credit offers by registering at www.OptOutPrescreen.com or by calling 1-888-5-OPT-OUT. Another way for consumers to protect themselves is to register their telephone and cellular phone numbers on the National Do-Not-Call Registry at www.DoNotCall.gov to reduce unsolicited calls.</p><h3 id="enforcement-agencies-ftc-and-cfpb-and-statute-of-limitations">Enforcement Agencies: FTC and CFPB, and Statute of Limitations</h3><p>While the HPPA does not create new enforcement authorities, enforcement continues through FCRA’s existing channels, namely the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Actions under FCRA, including actions relating to the new HPPA, must be brought by the consumer within: (i) two years after the date they discover the violation; or (ii) five years after the date of the violation itself, whichever is earlier.</p><h3 id="industry-must-adapt-non-compliance-will-be-costly">Industry Must Adapt: Non-Compliance Will Be Costly</h3><p>Credit bureaus will need to build or update “consent-capture” mechanisms. Lenders, mortgage brokers, insurance companies, and insurance brokers, must review and possibly revamp marketing strategies to comply with new consent and relationship thresholds. There will certainly be ongoing oversight. Regulators, industry groups, and consumer advocates will continue monitoring compliance. The law’s impact on competition, innovation, and consumer experience will likely continue evolving past its implementation.</p><h3 id="civil-liability-for-willful-noncompliance">Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance</h3><p>Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681(n) of the FCRA, any person or entity that willfully fails to comply with a FCRA requirement (such as the new restrictions on “trigger leads”) is civilly liable to the consumer. Damages may include: (i) actual damages that the consumer suffered as a result of the violation; or (ii) statutory damages of $100 to $1,000 per consumer, even if no actual harm is provable. In addition, courts may award punitive damages (intended to punish particularly egregious conduct) and reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs to the prevailing consumer.</p><p>Other FCRA provisions allow the CFPB or FTC to impose civil money penalties on entities for failing to comply with their statutory requirements. These penalties, in early 2024, were approximately $4,800 per violation and are adjusted for inflation annually.</p><h3 id="liability-for-obtaining-a-report-illegally-or-negligently">Liability for Obtaining a Report Illegally or Negligently</h3><p>If an individual or entity obtains a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, that individual or entity faces liability for actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater. Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681(o) of the FCRA, if a violation is not willful but merely negligent, consumers can still recover actual damages, plus attorney’s fees and costs.</p><h3 id="the-importance-of-privacy-protection-and-consumer-choice">The Importance of Privacy Protection and Consumer Choice</h3><p>The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act represents a meaningful step forward in consumer privacy within the mortgage and insurance ecosystem. By curbing trigger-lead abuse brings a measure of control back to homebuyers at a critical time in their lives. The law balances the need for a competitive mortgage and insurance market with the imperative to protect sensitive financial data from unwanted exploitation. As the law takes effect in March 2026, both consumers and industry participants will be affected. For homebuyers, the promise is a cleaner, less intrusive process. For lenders, compliance will be crucial, and at the same time, the new law underscores the value of trust, transparency, and obtaining consent when dealing with clients.</p><p><em>About the author: Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq., is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[According to the New York State Gaming Commission website: the CAC for the Empire City project has scheduled a final vote on the $2.3-billion project on Thursday, Sept. 25 at 10 a.m.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—The Community Advisory Committee for the $11.1-billion Freedom Plaza project rejected the plan by a 4-2 vote on Monday, thus killing the proposal on Manhattan’s East Side. The vote, combined with two other negative CAC project votes last week, means that there will be no casino development projects in Manhattan considered for gaming licenses by the New York State Gaming Commission later this year.</p><p>Freedom Plaza, which was to be located in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan, totaled 3.9 million square feet of development. The project, proposed by the Soloviev Group and Mohegan included two residential towers, offering 1,049 units, including 513 units of (nearly 50%) affordable housing. Freedom Plaza’s signature nearly five-acre park covers 70% of the site and is designed by one of the world’s leading urban landscape architects. The project includes approximately 400,000 square feet of gaming space, 140,000 square feet devoted to food and beverage and more than 1 million square feet of hotel space.</p><p>With the denial by the Freedom Plaza CAC, there remains five casino proposals for up to three full downstate casino gaming licenses to be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission by year’s end: two existing Video Lottery Terminal gaming facilities: Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts (Yonkers) and Resorts World NYC (Queens), as well as three development proposals— Metropolitan Park (Queens), The Coney (Brooklyn) and Bally's (Bronx). There was a total of eight original applicants for a downstate casino license. Last week, the CACs for the Manhattan-based Avenir and Caesars Palace Times Square rejected those projects, each by a 4-2 vote.</p><p>According to the New York State Gaming Commission website: the CAC for the Empire City project has scheduled a final vote on the $2.3-billion project on Thursday, Sept. 25, at 10 a.m., while the Resorts World New York City CAC has scheduled a final vote at 3 p.m. the same day. At press time, the CACs for the Bally’s, the Coney and Metropolitan Park have all held the mandatory two public hearings, but have yet to schedule a final vote. The CACs are mandated to vote on the projects by Tuesday, Sept. 30.</p><p>In response to community input, Freedom Plaza officials presented modifications to its plan at a CAC hearing on Sept. 15. Freedom Plaza announced a substantial increase in its housing commitment, raising the total number housing units to 1,080 and affordable units to 600, up from the previously planned 1,049 overall units and 513 affordable, as well as the new addition of apartment units for growing families.</p><blockquote>“The increase to 600 homes that working people can afford is the direct result of listening to the elected leaders and the community, and it affirms our core belief that development must serve the people who live and work here,” said Michael Hershman, CEO of Soloviev Group. “We have stood ready throughout this process to work with local leaders to deliver an application that maximizes the community benefits to the greatest extent possible as a result of this license, and with this expansion in housing we believe we are addressing the requests that have been made to date.”</blockquote><p>Freedom Plaza officials also announced a new partnership with Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit that has preserved more than 8,900 homes for low- and moderate-income families since 1969. Soloviev Group and Mohegan have committed $1 million to support the organization's work at Tanya Towers. Located at 620 East 13th Street, Tanya Towers provides 138 permanently affordable apartments, many of which are home to residents living with disabilities, are seniors, or are veterans.</p><p>In a press announcement on Sept. 15, Freedom Plaza reported that more than 3,000 individuals had submitted comments to the CAC advocating for Freedom Plaza, joining the 10,000 Manhattan residents and 250 local small businesses who previously signed a petition supporting the proposal. A September 2025 poll conducted by Tulchin Research poll found that nearly two-thirds of Manhattan voters supported the project and 58% of voters in Midtown East were specifically in favor. Despite the reported project support, the CAC rejected the plan, thus taking it out of consideration for a gaming license.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This unified effort will educate members, stakeholders, and the public on the potential impacts of Q3 and mobilize voter awareness ahead of the election.</p><h3 id="what-is-ballot-question-3">What is Ballot Question 3?</h3><p>Q3 proposes to simplify New York City’s land use review process for modest housing and infrastructure projects. Currently, even small-scale projects must navigate a complex, multi-step approval process, which can take years and significantly increase costs. Q3 is designed to remove unnecessary red tape while maintaining community input, creating a faster, fairer process for projects that expand housing supply, upgrade schools, improve transit and strengthen other local infrastructure.</p><h3 id="why-q3-matters">Why Q3 Matters</h3><p><strong>Housing Supply: </strong>Streamlining approvals allows more housing units to be delivered faster, helping to address NYC’s critical shortage of affordable homes.</p><p><strong>Affordability:</strong> Reducing delays lowers development costs, which can help stabilize rents and property prices.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Improvements:</strong> Faster project approvals mean quicker upgrades to schools, transit systems, and community facilities.</p><p><strong>Economic Impact: </strong>Expedited development supports construction jobs, local businesses and overall economic growth.</p><p><strong>Predictability for Professionals:</strong> Developers and Realtors benefit from reduced uncertainty, enabling better planning and investment decisions.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/09/279638A7-E229-48DF-9185-0A050230D5F9.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1758" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/279638A7-E229-48DF-9185-0A050230D5F9.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/279638A7-E229-48DF-9185-0A050230D5F9.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/09/279638A7-E229-48DF-9185-0A050230D5F9.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/09/279638A7-E229-48DF-9185-0A050230D5F9.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Front: Marlo Paventi, Vice President of Government and Political Affairs, Long Island Board of Realtors; Back: Alexander Roithmayr, HGAR Director of Government Affairs; Kevin Brady, LIBOR Government Affairs Director; and Dr. Jermaine Meadows, HGAR’s Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx.</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="hgar%E2%80%99s-role-and-campaign-plan">HGAR’s Role and Campaign Plan</h3><p>HGAR, together with LIBOR, BIBOR and SIBOR, will lead a comprehensive citywide education campaign to ensure members and the public understand Q3’s purpose and benefits.</p><p>The campaign will include:</p><ul>
<li>Digital outreach and social media campaigns targeting likely NYC voters.</li>
<li>Signage at brokerages and distribution of educational materials to communicate key points in an accessible way.</li>
<li>Informational videos and print materials to explain the advantages of streamlining the review process.</li>

<p>Member engagement through coalition events to encourage Realtor advocacy and participation.</p><p>The campaign will strategically combine online and in-person efforts, ensuring that messaging reaches New Yorkers in every borough.

Together, this coalition ensures that Realtors are not only advocating for their profession, but also empowering voters with the information they need to make informed decisions at the ballot box.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YONKERS—This morning, the MGM Empire City Community Advisory Committee unanimously approved the $2.3-billion MGM Empire City project. The Yonkers project is the first downstate gaming proposal to secure CAC approval.</p><p>With the 5-0 CAC affirmative vote, the Yonkers project now advances for full consideration with the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board. The Gaming Location Board is expected to reach a decision on all applications by Dec. 1 with the full gaming commission expected to approve up to three full downstate gaming licenses by year’s end. At press time, there are five projects still in the running for a gaming license. The Gaming Facility Location Board received a total of eight applications on June 27.</p><p>Prior to the final vote, the CAC, which met at the Yonkers Riverfront Library, unanimously approved the Community Benefits Agreement reached between MGM Empire and the City of Yonkers, which was recently approved by the Yonkers City Council.</p><blockquote>MGM Resorts released a statement on it being the first applicant to successfully pass the Community Advisory Committee for its MGM Empire City commercial casino license proposal: “We are grateful to the Community Advisory Committee and our local community for demonstrating their continued support for Empire City Casino. For more than 100 years, Yonkers Raceway and Empire City have been intertwined with the City of Yonkers. We look forward to continuing to drive well-paying jobs for local residents and providing hundreds of millions of dollars in annual education revenue to the State of New York.”</blockquote><p>At press time, the Resorts World New York City CAC is scheduled its final vote this afternoon. Bally's Bronx and The Coney are scheduled for final votes on Monday. The CAC for Steve Cohen's The Metropolitan Park project has scheduled its final vote on Tuesday.</p><p>Earlier this month, the CACs for the Manhattan-based Freedom Plaza, the Avenir and Caesars Palace Times Square rejected those projects, each by a 4-2 vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—New and existing home sales last month were mixed, with existing home sales activity falling slightly, while new home sales skyrocketed unexpectedly.</p><p>Existing-home sales remained essentially the same in August, ticking down by 0.2% from July, according to the National Association of Realtors Existing-Home Sales Report released earlier today.</p><p>Month-over-month sales increased in the Midwest and West, and fell in the Northeast and South. Year-over-year, sales rose in the Midwest and South, and fell in the Northeast and West.</p><blockquote>“Home sales have been sluggish over the past few years due to elevated mortgage rates and limited inventory,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, mortgage rates are declining and more inventory is coming to the market, which should boost sales in the coming months.”</blockquote><p>The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in August was 6.59%, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.72% in July and 6.50% one year ago.</p><p>“Record-high housing wealth and a record-high stock market will help current homeowners trade up and benefit the upper end of the market. However, sales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,” Yun added. “The Midwest was the best-performing region last month, primarily due to relatively affordable market conditions. The median home price in the Midwest is 22% below the national median price.”</p><h2 id="national-snapshot">National Snapshot</h2><h3 id="total-existing-home-sales-for-august"><br>Total Existing-Home Sales for August</h3><ul>

The pace of new home sales is up 15.4% from a year earlier. The three-month moving average of new home sales was 713,000, an increase from the 656,000 in July. New home sales remain down 1.4% on a year-to-date basis.</p><p>“New home sales experienced a significant surge in August, while builder confidence held steady at a low reading in September,” said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders and a home builder and developer from Lexington, NC. “While this month’s figure may be subject to downward revision, we do expect a general improvement in sales over the coming months, supported by the recent decline in mortgage rates.”</p><p>“According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has declined by 32 basis points over the past four weeks and now sits at 6.26%—its lowest level since early October 2024,” said Jing Fu, NAHB senior director of forecasting and analysis. “This downward trend in rates, combined with the recent Fed interest rate cut, signals a positive outlook for future housing demand. If this momentum continues, we expect new home sales to gain traction as more buyers reenter the market in the final quarter of 2025.”</p><p>New single-family home inventory declined for the third straight month to 490,000 residences marketed for sale (of all stages of construction) as of August. This is 1.4% lower than the previous month and 4.0% higher than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, the months’ supply for new homes was 7.4 compared to 8.2 a year ago.</p><p>The median new home sale price was $413,500, up 1.9% from a year ago.</p><p>New home sales have also been buoyed by home builders use of incentives. Recent NAHB survey data shows 37% of builders reported cutting prices in August and 66% reported using sales incentives.</p><p>Regionally, on a year-to-date basis, new home sales are down 22.0% in the Northeast, 3.9% in the Midwest and 7.3% in the West. New home sales are up 3.3% in the South.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[In terms of existing home sales, NAR now expects a 3% increase in 2025 as compared to 2025, while it anticipates a 14% jump in existing sales in 2026 as compared to this year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun gave a detailed presentation on the current economic conditions and the state of the housing market at the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors “Impact: The Member Experience” event. He noted that while the home sales downturn continues, there is hope on the horizon in the form of multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025 and 2026.</p><p>Yun noted that the latest inflation rate of 2.9% was higher than the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%, but a weakening job market prompted the Fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point at its September meeting.</p><p>The NAR Chief Economist said Wall Street has raised expectations and now forecasts a total of three rate cuts this year. In fact, JP Morgan recently predicted two more rate cuts at the Fed’s meetings in October and December and another rate cut in early 2026.</p><blockquote>“In my view, I think there will be probably around six rounds of rate cuts all the way through next year,” Yun told the HGAR gathering. He expects three rate cuts in 2025, followed by another three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026.</blockquote><p>Yun also addressed what was a foreshadowing federal government shutdown and said that he hoped safeguards would be put in place to prevent any delays in mortgage financing that might be caused by departmental shutdowns.</p><p>On the positive side, he related that wage growth of 3.7% is outpacing the inflation rate of 2.9%. On the local level, he related that New York State has 3.1% more jobs than it had pre-COVID-19 and that home sales activity in the HGAR region is outperforming national sales volume and price gain averages.</p><p>Yun said that NAR has downgraded some of its industry-related projections for 2025, but has upgraded its forecasts for 2026.</p><p>In terms of existing home sales, NAR now expects a 3% increase in 2025 as compared to 2025, while it anticipates a 14% jump in existing sales in 2026 as compared to this year. New home sales in 2025 will rise 5% this year and again by the same level next year, Yun related.</p><p>The national media home sale price will rise just 1% in 2025, but increase by 4% in 2026.</p><p>The average 30-year mortgage interest rate will end the year at approximately 6.7%, but decline to 6.0% in 2026, Yun related.</p><p>After his presentation when asked by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em> if he felt mortgage rates could fall below 6% in 2026, Yun responded, “I think people should consider 6% as the new normal, maybe a little bit lower or a little bit above. 5.5% there is some possibility, but 5% overall I really don’t think that will happen.”</p><p>Yun added that anytime there is even a small movement downward in interest rates, more prospective homeowners can then qualify for a home mortgage, which increases home sales volume.</p><p>“Even if we go to 6%, that is going to help more buyers come into the market. If it goes to 5.5%, you are looking at the market needing more inventory to accommodate that growth (in prospective buyers),” he said.</p><p>Yun also believes that inflation is under control and that any adverse impact caused by tariffs will be offset by falling rents in an overbuilt multifamily market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Cash buyers have long been a fixture in the market, but their influence is more pronounced today than in pre-pandemic years.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—Nearly one in three homes sold in the first half of 2025 were bought entirely with cash, according to an analysis released today by Realtor.com. The report highlights how cash buyers, ranging from equity-rich households to investors and second-home purchasers, continue to wield outsize influence in today's housing market.</p><p>Nationwide, 32.8% of home sales in the first half of 2025 were all-cash transactions. That share is down slightly from last year but remains well above pre-pandemic norms, when cash averaged just 28.6% of sales. Cash buying surged during the pandemic as investors competed for scarce listings, and it remains a powerful factor even as the market has cooled.</p><blockquote>“Cash buyers have long been a fixture in the market, but their influence is more pronounced today than in pre-pandemic years,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “High-wealth buyers, investors, and those with significant equity can move quickly and often win out in competitive situations. For traditional, mortgage-reliant buyers, this can add another hurdle in an already challenging affordability environment.”</blockquote><h3 id="whos-paying-cash">Who's Paying Cash?</h3><p>Cash dominates at the extremes of the market: two-thirds of homes under $100,000 and more than 40% of homes over $1 million were bought with cash, with the share topping 50% for homes above $2 million. This U-shaped pattern likely reflects investor activity, less access to financing, or credit barriers at the low end, and wealth concentration at the high end.</p><p>Older households and buyers with significant equity are especially likely to purchase without a mortgage, often using proceeds from a prior home sale. High-wealth buyers, meanwhile, are less influenced by borrowing costs and more likely to decide between cash and financing based on broader financial considerations.</p><h3 id="cash-counts-most-in-affordable-and-second-home-markets">Cash Counts Most in Affordable and Second-Home Markets</h3><p>The prevalence of cash buyers varies sharply across the country, driven by home prices, buyer demographics and local market dynamics.</p><p>Mississippi (49.6%), Montana (46.0%), Idaho (45.0%), Hawaii (44.9%), and Maine (44.4%) topped the list for all-cash share in the first half of 2025. In Mississippi, the high share of case sales reflects the state's lower home prices and more limited access to credit in some rural areas. By contrast, Hawaii and Maine attract affluent second-home buyers, many of them older and equity-rich. Meanwhile, Montana and Idaho have seen elevated shares as out-of-state buyers compete for homes.</p><p>Among metros, Miami (43.0%), San Antonio (39.6%), Kansas City, Kan. (39.2%), Birmingham, Ala. (38.8%), Houston (38.8%), and St. Louis (38.1%) led the nation in cash share for the first half of 2025. These markets reflect different drivers, from international and high-end demand in Miami and Houston to investor and affordability dynamics in San Antonio, Birmingham, Kansas City, and St. Louis.</p><p>By contrast, younger, high-cost, job-centered markets such as Seattle (17.9%), San Jose (20.6%), Denver (20.7%), and Washington, D.C. (21.5%) saw the lowest cash shares, and in many of these areas large shares of current homeowners have mortgage debt, suggesting more sensitivity to mortgage rate trends.</p><h3 id="year-over-year-shifts-highlight-changing-dynamics">Year-Over-Year Shifts Highlight Changing Dynamics</h3><p>West Virginia (+5.3%), New Mexico (+4.0%), Texas (+2.8%), and New York (+2.0%) posted the biggest increases in cash share in 2025, fueled by low-price investor activity, in-migration of wealthier households, and rebounding luxury demand. New York’s cash share for the first half of 2025 was 40.9%.</p><p>By contrast, Hawaii (-4.0%), New Hampshire (-3.7%), and North Dakota (-3.6%) saw the sharpest declines as luxury activity cooled or more mortgage-dependent buyers returned to the market. Texas metros in particular saw some of the biggest year-over-year gains, fueled by in-migration, institutional buyers, and renewed investor activity.</p><h3 id="cash-advantage-remains-though-lower-rates-could-shift-share">Cash Advantage Remains, Though Lower Rates Could Shift Share</h3><p>While cash buyers currently hold a strong edge, the balance could shift if mortgage rates decline. Lower borrowing costs would likely draw more financed buyers back into the market, particularly first-time buyers who have been sidelined by steep monthly payments.</p><p>“Cash sales underscore the wealth concentration shaping today's housing market,” said Hannah Jones, Senior Economic Research Analyst at Realtor.com. “If mortgage rates fall, we could see financed buyers regain ground, but for now, cash remains a powerful competitive advantage.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“This strategic plan is nothing like I have ever seen or been a part of,” Grasso related.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—National Association of Realtors Chief Executive Officer Nykia Wright and NAR Senior Vice President Industry Relations Jarrod Grasso sat down with Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors Chief Executive Officer Lynda Fernandez to discuss association reform and NAR’s strategic plans going forward at HGAR’s Impact: The Member Experience event on Sept. 29.</p><p>The nearly hour-long session proved to be a frank discussion on how the National Association of Realtors has emerged from a tumultuous period of scandal and litigation to focusing on providing key services and information to its membership.</p><p>NAR’s Wright stressed her strong commitment to the association’s mantra “helping Realtors get to the next transaction.”</p><blockquote>In a rather poignant exchange, Wright stressed: “Understand that NAR is not playing towards headlines. I am not worried about the headline today at 5 p.m. I am worried about the headline six months from now and whether or not I have delivered on what I said I was going to deliver. And that means that in the next six months journalists are going to have their opinions on where we are in the market. The important thing for you to remember is you saw me today and I am standing here before you putting my reputation on the line saying we are back to basics and we are trying to give you all everything you need as Realtors.”</blockquote><p>Wright stressed that one important way for members to engage with NAR is to participate in the association’s surveys so that it can gain member feedback on initiatives and perhaps get new ideas it can implement.</p><p>She continued that in the next few years NAR is committed to being a “service-oriented organization” that is geared to getting its members to the next transaction.</p><p>In response to Fernandez’s question on how NAR is bringing its “reimagined vision to life,” Grasso responded that he has been traveling the country to ensure that NAR is engaged in trying to reconnect with its state and local associations and brokers.</p><p>“I want to make sure that we are having real conversations about the needs and the wants of the members and hopefully help them understand that this is not the NAR of old,” Grasso said, noting that the association in the past operated like an isolationist. “We are now out there actively seeking your input and we want to make sure that we are having real conversations that will bring back the real value to the dues-paying member. Because you (the member) are the foundation of this organization,” he added.</p><p>Wright related that NAR formed a Strategic Planning Committee that consists of volunteers, which differs from most organizations that embark initially on the formation of a new strategic plan in-house. However, since NAR is a member organization, the association began work on its strategic plan with volunteers and then hired consultants and held a series of focus groups that eventually led the association to decide in its forthcoming three-year strategic plan a total of 22 things the association would do going forward.</p><p>“This strategic plan is nothing like I have ever seen or been a part of,” Grasso related. … “It is truly giving us giving us guidance, guidance that we haven’t had in years and guidance that is going to make sure we are delivering true value back to the members.”</p><p>Wright also highlighted the important work NAR’s Advocacy Team is undertaking for the members, working on the “four Is—interest rates, inventory, inflation and insurance, which she said are the most important macro-economic issues facing the industry at the moment.</p><p>She related that while the association continues to evolve, its advocacy efforts on behalf of its members are second to none.</p><p>“I know there is a lot of noise, but we really need to understand and think about return on capital here,” Wright said. “People are paying $156 a year for the National Association of Realtors. “You are getting the most sophisticated advocacy machine in the nation. You are getting one of the top five research and housing economists in the nation to give you statistics and give you tools to understand changes in interest rates and what is going on as it relates to unlocking issues in housing.”</p><p>She also touted the many products and tools that provide members with the Content Management System that would normally require significant investment. Lastly, she said that NAR’s meetings provide members with opportunities to engage “belly to belly” with thousands of members to network and conduct transactions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The latest drop, the second month-over-month decline since March, reflects the market's normal cooling heading into fall.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—While the Realtor.com September Rent Report notes that rents have declined again for the month, increasing affordability in many markets across the country where the typical household spends a little more than 23% of their incomes on rent. However, the New York metro region saw little change in rental costs and the typical household now spends 36.7% of its income on rent.</p><p>Realtor.com reports that rents declined again in September, according to its September Rent Report, extending a two-year stretch of easing prices and modestly improving affordability for typical households. The latest drop, the second month-over-month decline since March, reflects the market's normal cooling heading into fall.</p><p>The median asking monthly rent for 0–2 bedroom properties in the 50 largest metros was $1,703, down $36 (-2.1%) from a year ago and $10 lower than the prior month. Monthly rents now sit $56 (-3.2%) below their August 2022 peak but remain $241 (16.5%) higher than before the pandemic. Overall, rent growth has been subdued in 2025, with median asking prices up just 0.4% year to date, compared with a 1.9% increase during the same period in 2024.</p><p>“Two years of gradual rent declines have given renters a bit more breathing room,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “Still, even as a typical household spends a smaller share of income on rent than a year ago, affordability remains stretched in major markets, particularly along the coasts.”</p><h3 id="affordability-improves-but-challenges-persist">Affordability Improves, But Challenges Persist</h3><p>Renters earning the typical household income devoted 23.4% of their income to lease a typical home in September, down from 24.9% one year ago. This shift reflects both modest rent declines and income growth over the past year. Rents declined year-over-year across all unit sizes, led by one-bedroom units at $1,582 (-2.3%), followed by two-bedroom units at $1,885 (-2.2%), and studios at $1,426 (-1.0%).</p><p>In September, renters faced the steepest costs in Miami, where housing consumed 37.1% of the typical household income. Los Angeles (37%), New York (36.7%), Boston (32.3%), and San Diego (31.5%) rounded out the top five. Still, rent burdens in each of these markets declined slightly compared with a year ago, showing modest improvement in some of the nation's most expensive metros. The rental-household income share for the New York region declined from 37.6% in September 2024 to 36.7% last month.</p><p>According to the Realtor.com report, the median asking rent in the New York metro region (New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ) in September was $2,903, a decrease of 0.9% from a year earlier. The maximum affordable rent at current household incomes was $2,374.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, Austin, TX overtook Oklahoma City, OK to become the most affordable rental market, with renters spending just 16.5% of income on a typical lease. Oklahoma City took the second most-affordable spot (16.9%), followed by Raleigh, NC (18.0%), Columbus, OH (18.1%), and Minneapolis, MN (18.7%).</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our application have shifted, altering our return expectations on the proposed $2.3-billion investment.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YONKERS—In a shocking move, MGM Yonkers Inc. announced in the late afternoon on Tuesday, Oct. 14 that it was withdrawing its application for a full commercial casino license at its Empire City property here.</p><p>MGM Empire City was one of four applicants to be considered by the Gaming Facility Location Board and later the State Gaming Commission for up to three full commercial casino gaming licenses to be awarded by year’s end. MGM Empire Casino in Yonkers won a unanimous 5-0 vote on Sept. 25 from its Community Advisory Committee to advance.</p><blockquote>In a statement MGM said it “made the difficult decision to withdraw its application for a commercial casino license in Yonkers, New York. Since submitting our application in June, the competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our application have shifted, altering our return expectations on the proposed $2.3-billion investment.”</blockquote><p>MGM’s statement specifically cited the shortened casino licensing term by the New York State Gaming Commission as a key reason for its withdrawal. “The newly defined competitive landscape—with four proposals clustered in a small geographic area—challenges the returns we initially anticipated from this project. Also, our proposal to renovate and expand Empire City Casino was predicated on the receipt of a 30-year commercial casino license but based on newly issued guidance from the State of New York we now expect to qualify for only a 15-year license. Taken together, these events result in a proposition that no longer aligns with our commitment to capital stewardship, nor to that of our real estate partner in Yonkers, VICI,” MGM stated.</p><p>Under a proposed rule issued in August by New York State Gaming Commission General Counsel Edmund Burns, the term of a casino license would be based on the amount of investment. The rule, which was published in the State Register on Oct. 8 and is now under a 60-day comment period that ends on Dec. 7, establishes four tiers in terms of licensing term— 10 years for investments up to $1.5 billion, 15 years for investments for up to $5 billion; 20 years for investments up to $10 billion and 30 years for investments of more than $10 billion.</p><p>All four casino applicants—MGM Empire City, Resorts World New York City in Queens, Metropolitan Park in Queens and Bally’s in the Bronx are under the $10-billion threshold. However, on Oct. 14, Resorts World New York City announced it had filed a supplemental application with the New York State Gaming Commission that increased its overall investment from $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion, including $2 billion in community benefits. Under the proposed rule, Resorts World New York City could qualify for a 20-year casino license. Metropolitan Park in Queens at an $8.1-billion investment value could also qualify for a 20-year license, while Bally’s in the Bronx coming in at a projected $4-billion cost could qualify for a 15-year license.</p><p>The MGM Empire City proposal, which calls for a $2.3 billion total investment was the smallest of the four casino license candidates and would qualify under a 15-year casino licensing term. It would need to more than double its investment to qualify for a 20-year license. The $2.3-billion investment into the expansion of the existing Video Lottery Terminal facility included a total of $1.8 billion in capital investment.</p><p>In its application for a casino license earlier this year, MGM Empire City stated: “In order to meet a minimally acceptable return on such a level of investment, we require the maximum 30-year license term.”</p><p>Concluding its statement, MGM noted its partnership with the City of Yonkers and New York State and touted Empire City Casino’s revenue generation over the years, including $1.6 billion since it took ownership of the property in 2019. “We know our decision will impact many individuals; we remain committed to operating the property in its current format and believe it will continue to enjoy success serving customers in Yonkers and the surrounding communities,” MGM stated.</p><p>Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano offered harsh criticism of MGM’s decision to abandon its plan at Empire City. “This decision by MGM defies all logic and it’s nothing short of a betrayal to the people of Yonkers and Westchester County. I am calling on Governor Hochul to launch an independent investigation into this process, because the reasons MGM gives for its 180-degree reversal just don't add up,” the mayor stated.</p><p>Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins shared the mayor’s criticism and stated he was “shocked, disappointed, and deeply dismayed by MGM Resorts’ decision to withdraw its commercial casino license application.” He concluded: “For decades, so many of us have supported this effort, believing in the promise of good-paying jobs, new investment, and long-term economic stability for Yonkers and Westchester County. While this was not the outcome we hoped for, we remain committed to supporting MGM and Yonkers and to ensuring that our community continues to thrive.”</p><p>The Business Council of Westchester and the coalition, “A Sure Bet for New York’s Future,” in a statement said they were “deeply disappointed by today’s announcement that MGM Empire City will withdraw from the casino licensing process. Throughout the many years of this effort, we have fought tirelessly with the MGM Empire City team to ensure that this important local business—one of the largest private employers in New York’s third largest city—would be given the opportunity to compete for a full-scale commercial casino license, which would have allowed MGM to directly hire 2,000 new employees.”</p><p>They termed the decision “devastating news for the City of Yonkers, the County of Westchester, and our entire region” and later stated that it is “a major setback for economic development, workforce opportunity, and community growth across the Hudson Valley and beyond.”</p><p>The New York State Gaming Commission had no comment on Mayor Spano’s comments requesting a state investigation into the casino selection process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Come March 2026, the federal government will expect nothing less than full compliance, and the penalties for non-reporting could be severe.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real estate professionals, such as attorneys, real estate brokers, and title companies alike, should prepare for and be aware of one of the most sweeping anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance changes in decades. In August 2024, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) finalized the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations for Residential Real Estate Transfers, known informally as the Residential Real Estate Rule (“RRE Rule” or “Rule”) [see <a href="https://bit.ly/42GQVCy">https://bit.ly/42GQVCy</a>].</p><p>Originally, the RRE Rule was set to take effect on Dec. 1, 2025. The Rule would have required closing professionals to file detailed reports with FinCEN for certain non-financed (i.e., all-cash or privately financed) property transfers [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4nSqq5E">https://bit.ly/4nSqq5E</a>]. However, on September 30, 2025, FinCEN announced that it is postponing the effective date to March 1, 2026, through an Exemptive Relief Order [see <a href="https://bit.ly/4h8PZMY">https://bit.ly/4h8PZMY</a>]. While this short postponement gives the industry some additional time to prepare for its implementation, the RRE Rule will be going into effect.</p><h3 id="background-what-the-rre-rule-requires">Background: What the RRE Rule Requires</h3><p>The RRE Rule expands FinCEN’s effort to increase transparency in the U.S. real estate market [see <a href="https://bit.ly/3KNFqTJ">https://bit.ly/3KNFqTJ</a>]. Since 2016, FinCEN has relied on Geographic Targeting Orders (“GTOs”) requiring title insurance companies to report all-cash purchases in certain metropolitan areas. The new rule replaces those GTOs with a nationwide, permanent reporting regime under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) [see <a href="http://bit.ly/3IKfHel">http://bit.ly/3IKfHel</a>]. Below are some of the key elements of the RRE Rule:</p><p><strong><em>Covered Transactions</em></strong></p><p>The RRE Rule applies to non-financed transfers of residential real property when the transferee is a legal entity or trust, not an individual. The types of real property covered by the Rule include:</p><ul>
<li>Single-family homes, condos, co-ops, and vacant land intended for residential use;</li>
<li>Partial interests and transfers through entities or trusts; and</li>
<li>Certain mixed-use or multi-unit properties, if predominantly residential.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Reporting Persons</em></strong></p><p>FinCEN establishes a “cascade” of potential reporting parties, such as settlement agents, title or escrow companies, attorneys, and other closing professionals, and allows parties to assign reporting responsibility by written agreement. If no one is designated, the first qualifying party in the chain must report. The reporting “cascade” is as follows:</p><ol>
<li>The person listed as the closing or settlement agent on the closing or settlement statement;</li>
<li>If no person described above is involved, the person who prepares the closing or settlement statement;</li>
<li>If no person described above is involved, the person who files with the recordation office the deed or other instrument that transfers ownership of the residential real property;</li>
<li>If no person described above is involved, the person who underwrites an owner’s title insurance policy for the transferee with respect to the transferred residential real property, such as a title insurance company;</li>
<li>If no person described above is involved, the person who disburses in any form, including from an escrow account, trust account, or lawyers’ trust account, the greatest amount of funds in connection with the residential real property transfer;</li>
<li>If no person described above is involved, the person who provides an evaluation of the status of the title; or</li>
<li>If no person described above is involved, the person who prepares the deed or, if no deed is involved, any other legal instrument that transfers ownership of the residential real property, including, with respect to shares in a cooperative housing corporation, the person who prepares the stock certificate.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Required Information</em></strong></p><p>The reporting window is expected to be thirty (30) days after closing. Electronic filing through FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing portal will be mandatory. Each report (i.e., Form FinCEN RER) must disclose:</p><ul>
<li>Names, addresses, and taxpayer or passport IDs for all beneficial owners of the transferee entity or trust;</li>
<li>Transferor/seller details, property address, and transaction amount;</li>
<li>Payment method, including use of cash, checks, wires, crypto, or other forms of value;</li>
<li>Information on involved professionals (closing agent, attorney, escrow, etc.); and</li>
<li>Copies of supporting records, which must be retained for five (5) years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Exemptions</em></strong></p><p>The RRE Rule exempts transfers: (1) involving regulated financial institutions already subject to AML programs; (2) ordered by courts (probate, divorce, bankruptcy); (3) to governmental bodies; or (4) resulting from foreclosures or eminent domain. FinCEN provides a helpful FAQ for industry professionals which provides critical guidance regarding the RRE Rule [see <a href="https://bit.ly/48tM77g">https://bit.ly/48tM77g</a>]. The required filing form can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/4nPgfyN">https://bit.ly/4nPgfyN</a>.</p><h3 id="purpose-closing-the-aml-%E2%80%9Cloophole%E2%80%9D">Purpose: Closing the AML “Loophole”</h3><p>FinCEN indicates that the reporting requirements of the RRE Rule “are expected to assist the U.S. Department of the Treasury, law enforcement, and national security agencies in addressing illicit finance vulnerabilities in the U.S. residential real estate sector, and to curtail the ability of illicit actors to anonymously launder illicit proceeds through transfers of residential real property….” FinCEN further points out that “[i]nvestigations revealed that shell companies, LLCs, and trusts are frequently used to mask beneficial ownership in high-value all-cash transactions.”</p><p>According to FinCEN, the reporting process will mirror the Corporate Transparency Act (“CTA”) beneficial ownership registry but will focus specifically on property transfers. By creating a permanent database of who truly owns U.S. residential property, FinCEN hopes to deter illicit investment, and bring U.S. standards in line with those in the European Union and United Kingdom.</p><h3 id="the-postponement-from-december-1-2025-to-march-1-2026">The Postponement: From December 1, 2025 to March 1, 2026</h3><p>According to FinCEN, the delay to March 1st allows additional time for reporting persons to develop and implement systems and procedures necessary for compliance. Industry groups, such as the American Land Title Association (“ALTA”), applauded the delay, citing heavy compliance burdens [see <a href="https://bit.ly/46St9Gg">https://bit.ly/46St9Gg</a>]. FinCEN is providing this temporary relief to allow reporting persons additional time to implement the systems, training, and processes necessary to comply with the RRE Rule [see <a href="https://bit.ly/48nm0Pg">https://bit.ly/48nm0Pg</a>]. Industry feedback suggested that compliance costs were greatly underestimated, particularly for smaller title agencies, closing attorneys, and escrow firms.</p><h3 id="geographic-targeting-orders-still-apply">Geographic Targeting Orders Still Apply</h3><p>While the RRE Rule is delayed, the current GTOs remain in force. FinCEN renewed the GTOs on Oct. 10, 2025, extending them through February 28, 2026, to ensure continuous reporting coverage before the new RRE Rule takes effect [see renewal notice at <a href="https://bit.ly/3L6T1FA">https://bit.ly/3L6T1FA</a>]. Under the GTOs, title insurance companies in specified metropolitan areas (such as New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) must continue to report all-cash purchases of residential property by legal entities when the purchase price exceeds $300,000.</p><h3 id="industry-impact-why-the-delay-matters">Industry Impact: Why the Delay Matters</h3><p>The delay is not simply procedural. It gives firms and industry participants a reasonable opportunity to prepare intelligently rather than reactively for its implementation. FinCEN’s 100-plus field reporting form is complex and will require new data collection systems and internal policies to be established.</p><p><strong><em>Building Compliance Infrastructure</em></strong></p><p>During this extended implementation period, professionals should put in place procedures for determining which party will serve as the reporting person in each transaction. They should also develop beneficial ownership questionnaires consistent with the Corporate Transparency Act standards and review closing software capabilities to capture trust and entity data. Industry participants should update engagement letters and closing instructions to allocate responsibility for RRE filings and train staff to identify covered transactions early in the process.</p><p><strong><em>RRE Filing Requirements</em></strong></p><p>There is no fee for submitting a Real Estate Report (RER) directly to FinCEN through FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing System at <a href="https://bsaefiling.fincen.gov/">https://bsaefiling.fincen.gov</a>. According to FinCEN, “[r]eporting persons may use third-party service providers to submit RERs to FinCEN. Those providers might charge fees for their services. Before authorizing a third-party service provider to file a RER with FinCEN, you should: (1) understand the fees for the offered services; and (2) carefully review any terms of service or agreements.” If multiple parties participate in a closing, they should specify, in writing, who will file the RRE Report. Absent such an agreement, responsibility may default unexpectedly, exposing an unprepared party to significant liability.</p><p><strong><em>Data-Security and Privacy</em></strong></p><p>Because the RRE Rule will collect sensitive personal information (e.g., passport numbers, SSNs, trust agreements, and other critical personally identifiable information), closing agents must plan robust data-security protocols. FinCEN promises confidentiality, but cyber-risk and recordkeeping standards remain the filer’s responsibility.</p><h3 id="legal-and-practical-considerations">Legal and Practical Considerations</h3><p><br><strong><em>Liability and Penalties</em></strong></p><p>Failure to file or inaccurate filings can trigger civil and criminal penalties under the BSA. Given the complexity of entity ownership chains, it is essential to verify beneficial ownership data carefully. The RRE Rule operates under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) authorities, which allow both civil and criminal sanctions for violations of reporting, recordkeeping, and filing obligations. Under the final rule as published, penalties are tiered depending on whether conduct is negligent or willful.</p><p><strong><em>Civil Penalties for Negligent Violations</em></strong></p><p>A negligent violation of the RRE Rule may lead to a civil penalty of up to approximately $1,394 per violation (as of the latest Rule’s publication). For a pattern of negligent violations, an additional civil penalty of up to $108,489 may be assessed. Thus, repeating the same mistake across multiple closings could significantly multiply exposure under the “pattern” threshold.</p><p><strong><em>Civil &amp; Criminal Penalties for Willful Violations</em></strong></p><p>If a violator acts willfully, that is, knowingly or with reckless disregard of the requirements, the penalties increase. The criminal penalties can also include up to five (5) years imprisonment. A criminal fine of up to $250,000 (or possibly more under aggravating circumstances) may accompany imprisonment. There are also enhanced civil penalties that may apply. In the willful case, a civil penalty of up to the greater of the amount involved in the transaction (subject to a cap), or $69,733. There is a transaction-cap (i.e. a ceiling) of $278,937 on the punitive civil penalty tied to the transaction amount, where that amount is greater.</p><p><strong><em>Action Steps Before March 1, 2026</em></strong></p><p>The postponement provides time for firms to plan and test compliance systems. During this window, professionals should identify their reporting responsibilities, train staff, and coordinate with title companies and vendors. Below are some of the critical steps industry professionals should take prior to the March 1, 2026 effective date:</p><ol>
<li>Designate a compliance lead.</li>
<li>Create an internal checklist to identify covered transactions.</li>
<li>Review contracts and assign reporting responsibilities.</li>
<li>Train staff on beneficial ownership data collection.</li>
<li>Coordinate with vendors and title insurers for E-filing readiness.</li>
<li>Educate clients using LLCs or trusts about new disclosure obligations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-postponement-allows-for-some-breathing-room">The Postponement Allows for Some Breathing Room</h3><p>The postponement to March 1, 2026, provides the real estate industry five additional months to prepare. For attorneys, brokers, and title professionals, the key takeaway is clear: use this window wisely and educate themselves. Build your compliance framework now, test your reporting systems, and align your processes with both the Corporate Transparency Act and FinCEN’s RRE Rule requirements. Come March 2026, the federal government will expect nothing less than full compliance, and the penalties for non-reporting could be severe.</p><p><em>About the author: Legal Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—OneKey MLS released its September 2025 residential market statistics earlier this week, revealing continued stability in home prices and modest gains in sales activity across the New York regional area.</p><p>Closed sales for all property types rose 1.3% year-over-year to 4,257 transactions. Single-family home sales increased 2.8%, while condominium sales climbed 3.2%. Co-op sales, however, declined 8.9%. The overall median sale price, encompassing single-family homes, condos, and co-ops, rose 6.9% to $695,000, with co-ops leading price growth at 8.0%.</p><p>Inventory levels remained tight, with the number of homes for sale down 3.4% compared to September 2024. The region’s current month’s supply of inventory stands at 3.9 months—below the 4-to-6-month range typically associated with a balanced market.</p><h3 id="localized-trends-reflect-market-variability">Localized Trends Reflect Market Variability</h3><p>While regional metrics signal a stable housing environment, county-level data highlight ongoing variation in performance:</p><ul>
<li>The Bronx saw a 1.4% increase in median home price to $694,750.</li>
<li>Suffolk and Rockland counties posted modest gains of 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.</li>
<li>Queens remained steady with a slight 0.2% uptick.</li>
<li>In contrast, Putnam and Sullivan counties experienced notable price declines, down 16.1% and 15.98%, respectively.</li>
<li>Westchester and Dutchess counties both recorded decreases exceeding 9.5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>These mixed results suggest that while buyer demand remains solid in core suburban and urban areas, some outer counties are seeing price adjustments influenced by affordability pressures and local supply dynamics.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3><p>With pending sales up 14.4% month-over-month, the regional housing market appears positioned for continued momentum heading into the fourth quarter. However, affordability remains a growing concern, as the regional housing affordability index declined 8.5% compared to last year.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/10/Regional-Closed-Median-Sale-Prices0925b.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1372" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Regional-Closed-Median-Sale-Prices0925b.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Regional-Closed-Median-Sale-Prices0925b.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/Regional-Closed-Median-Sale-Prices0925b.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/10/Regional-Closed-Median-Sale-Prices0925b.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To access all local and regional housing market reports, visit <a href="https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/">https://marketstats.onekeymls.com</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, in partnership with The Queens &amp; Bronx Building Association, hosted its annual Legislative Breakfast, convening elected officials, Realtor leaders, and community partners for a powerful discussion on housing, policy, and the shared priorities shaping our region’s future. </p><p>The event served as a platform to reflect on the year’s legislative developments and to look ahead toward 2026 with renewed purpose and clarity. Dr. Jermaine Meadows, HGAR’s Bronx &amp; Manhattan Director of Government Affairs, led the program by presenting HGAR’s 2026 Legislative Priorities, designed to align the organization’s advocacy with the real-world challenges and goals of its members. Drawing on months of listening sessions and policy discussions, Dr. Meadows outlined a forward-leaning agenda centered on housing affordability, co-op transparency, economic growth, and fair housing advancement.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/10/IMG_5496-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/IMG_5496-1.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/IMG_5496-1.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/IMG_5496-1.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/10/IMG_5496-1.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Panel Moderator Gary Axelbank, host of BronxTalk on BronxNet; New York State Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz; New York State Assemblyman Landon Dais and New York City Council Member Kevin Riley.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>This year’s breakfast featured Kenny Burgos, former New York State Assembly Member and now CEO of the New York Apartment Association, as keynote speaker.

    <description><![CDATA[This legislation will make available an opt-in tax incentive to incentivize redevelopment of vacant or abandoned one-to-four family homes for use as affordable homeownership or rental housing.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a legislative package earlier today to bolster homeownership and strengthen protections for renters.</p><p>The homeowner package will make homeownership more attainable through tax incentives and strengthens laws and policies to combat home appraisal discrimination. The renters’ package will strengthen protections for tenants statewide including extending protections on security deposits, limits on excessive fees for bounced checks, and banning collusion using algorithm-enabled rent price fixing used to inflate rents.</p><blockquote>“Every New Yorker deserves a safe, stable place to call home,” Gov. Hochul said. “With this legislation, we’re opening more doors to homeownership and strengthening protections for renters—because every New Yorker deserves the fair chance to build a better life in a home they can afford. I am committed to delivering fairness and affordability in every corner of our state, so more New Yorkers can put down roots and build a future right here at home.”</blockquote><h3 id="bolstering-homeownership-opportunities">Bolstering Homeownership Opportunities</h3><p>Legislation (A355-C/S1718-B) creates an affordable homebuyer opt-in property tax incentive for homes built with assistance from governmental entities, nonprofits, land banks, or community land trusts, and sold to low- and moderate-income homebuyers.</p><p>Legislation (A6770/S7285) empowers communities to redevelop vacant properties into housing. Many municipalities struggle with vacant and abandoned buildings that are in a significant state of disrepair in neighborhoods that lack the local economic conditions necessary to incentivize redevelopment. Consequently, the investment required to redevelop these properties can exceed their value and the resulting funding gap prevents the property from being rehabilitated. This legislation will make available an opt-in tax incentive to incentivize redevelopment of vacant or abandoned one-to-four family homes for use as affordable homeownership or rental housing. This tool will help localities across the state combat vacant and abandoned properties and revitalize neighborhoods while also promoting more affordable housing opportunities.</p><p>Legislation (A6869/S7320) strengthens laws and policies to combat home appraisal discrimination. For too long, pervasive appraisal bias throughout the housing industry has unjustly stripped families of color of this opportunity, widening racial homeownership and wealth gaps. This legislation will make it a violation of the State's Human Rights Law to discriminate when providing real estate appraisals or in making such services available. The law will further enable the Department of State to fine appraisers for violations, in addition to other existing remedies, with half of those fines going to a fund to support fair housing enforcement.</p><p>Legislation (A3470/S7413) requires notice to be provided 90 days prior to commencement of a foreclosure action by a homeowners' association or condominium board lien for unpaid common charges, assessments, fines or fees.</p><h3 id="strengthening-protections-for-renters">Strengthening Protections for Renters</h3><p>Legislation (S7882/A1417-B) bans collusion using algorithm-enabled rent price fixing. Recent data shows that price-fixing algorithms cost tenants nationwide an estimated $3.8 billion more in inflated rents last year alone. The software companies make no secret that private data algorithms are intended to drive rent increases, with some openly advertising that they can help property owners outperform the market, resulting in housing market distortion and hurting tenants during a historic housing supply and affordability crisis. This legislation will protect renters from these practices, making New York among the first states in the nation to address rent price fixing collusion using these software services.</p><p>Legislation (S952-B/A6423-A) extends security deposit protections to rent-regulated tenants. In 2019, New York State provided market-rate tenants statewide with protections for security deposits, including requiring the return of remaining security deposits within 14 days of vacating the unit and allowing tenants to request an inspection to determine what needs to be remedied to receive a security deposit back in full. Rent-regulated tenants were erroneously left out from receiving these important protections. This legislation will grant rent-regulated tenants the same protections for their security deposits as all other tenants.</p><p>Legislation (A56-B/S3845-B) limits the fees a landlord could collect due to a bounced check to the greater of $20 or the costs the landlord incurred.</p><p>Legislation (S8311-A/A8412-D) ensures that family members and other individuals with established emotional and financial ties to tenants of NYCHA properties are granted succession rights. This prevents displacement of families and promotes transparency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The country’s highest court won’t take up an appeal that sought to overturn a ruling favoring the National Association of Realtors. NAR successfully litigated the antitrust case twice in lower courts.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This article first appeared in Realtor Magazine. <em>Reprinted with permission from the National Association of Realtors.</em></p><p>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court provided final resolution for a case brought against the National Association of Realtors, after the association successfully litigated the case in two lower courts.</p><p>The brokerage Real Estate Exchange, Inc. (REX) sued NAR and Zillow in March 2021, alleging NAR’s optional non-commingling rule (sometimes called the “no commingling” rule) violated federal antitrust laws. The optional rule, which was repealed in June, allowed MLSs to require that listings from non-MLS sources be displayed separately from MLS listings.</p><p>Previously, judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Washington at Seattle ruled in favor of NAR; and on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to take up Real Estate Exchange’s appeal, ending the legal battle.</p><p><em>“As we have said from day one, NAR’s optional no-commingling rule was not an antitrust violation,” an NAR spokesperson said following the Supreme Court’s decision. “Both the district court and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this, and we are pleased their rulings will stand. Local MLSs play a key role in fostering transparent, competitive and fair housing markets by delivering consumers the most accurate and up-to-date information on home listings. While the optional rule is no longer in effect, NAR remains committed to protecting the benefits MLSs provide agents, consumers and the industry.”</em></p><p>Separate from legal proceedings, NAR’s executive committee voted to repeal the optional policy in June. The decision was informed by feedback from the MLS community about the rule’s declining usage and relevance in local marketplaces, NAR’s Associate General Counsel and Vice President, Association Legal Affairs, Charlie Lee explained at the time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Against this backdrop, HGAR and our partner associations have officially launched the “Vote Yes on Proposal 3” campaign, a nearly $400,000 initiative to modernize New York City’s land use process and unlock housing opportunities across all boroughs.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As New York City’s political season heats up, housing remains at the center of the conversation. Last week’s Mayoral Debate brought together three distinct voices vying to lead the city through its next chapter: Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (Democrat), former Governor Andrew Cuomo (Independent), and Curtis Sliwa (Republican). </p><p>The debate was spirited and substantive and highlighted the candidates’ sharply different visions for the city’s future. Mamdani, representing a new generation of progressive leadership, called for deeper investments in affordable housing and stronger protections for tenants. Cuomo, positioning himself as a seasoned independent, emphasized pragmatism, experience, and an ability to cut through bureaucracy to deliver results. Sliwa, representing the conservative perspective, focused on restoring public safety and revitalizing small businesses as the foundation for long-term stability.</p><p>For the real estate and housing community, the debate underscored a central truth: no vision for New York’s future is complete without a bold housing agenda. Each candidate—though differing in ideology—acknowledged the urgent need to address the city’s growing affordability crisis and outdated development processes that have stalled progress for too long.</p><h3 id="a-campaign-for-change-%E2%80%98vote-yes-on-proposal-3%E2%80%99">A Campaign for Change: ‘Vote Yes on Proposal 3’</h3><p>Against this backdrop, HGAR and our partner associations have officially launched the “Vote Yes on Proposal 3” campaign, a nearly $400,000 initiative to modernize New York City’s land use process and unlock housing opportunities across all boroughs. Through the National Association of Realtors Issues Mobilization Fund, HGAR and collaborating boards secured nearly $300,000 in national support, in addition to substantial funding through the NYSAR Issues Mobilization Fund.</p><p>Proposal 3 aims to reform and streamline the city’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) for modest housing and infrastructure projects. It targets small-scale developments and community improvement projects that too often get caught in years of red tape and administrative delay. By removing unnecessary barriers while maintaining community input, Proposal 3 creates a faster, fairer and more predictable process that better serves both residents and developers.</p><h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it Matters?</h3><p>New York City’s housing shortage has reached a critical point. For too long, procedural inefficiencies have added years and costs to even modest projects—costs that ultimately get passed on to renters and buyers.</p><p>Proposal 3 delivers solutions where they are needed most:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Housing Supply</strong>: By expediting approvals, P3 helps deliver more housing units at a faster pace.</li>
<li><strong>Affordability</strong>: Reduced delays translate into lower development costs, which can help stabilize rents and home prices.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Quicker approvals for schools, transit, and community facilities support neighborhood growth and quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs &amp; Economy</strong>: Streamlined projects mean shovels in the ground sooner—creating jobs and stimulating local business activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Realtors P3 represents more than policy it’s a statement of leadership. It brings predictability and confidence to the marketplace, reduces risk for developers and property owners, and positions our profession as a champion of progress, housing opportunity and responsible growth.</p><h3 id="standing-together-advocacy-in-action">Standing Together: Advocacy in Action</h3><p>Our work doesn’t stop with policy it depends on participation. We encourage all Realtors to join us on Monday, Oct. 27th at 10:30 a.m. in City Hall Park for our <a href="https://www.hgar.com/events/find-an-event?event=LE102725&ref=realestateindepth.com" rel="noreferrer">NYC Realtor Rally</a> in support of Proposal 3. This is our moment to make our voices heard and show that the real estate industry is united in the fight for a stronger, more accessible New York City.</p><p>Early voting begins Saturday, October 25, and Election Day is November 4. The window is short, but our collective impact can be lasting. Let’s stay engaged, informed, and visible as advocates for the communities we serve.</p><p>And as the conversation continues, don’t forget to tune in tonight (Oct. 22) at 7 p.m. for the second Mayoral Debate. The issues shaping our city’s future—housing, infrastructure, affordability and economic stability demand our full attention and continued leadership.</p><p>Together, we can ensure that the voice of real estate remains at the center of New York’s path forward.</p><figure><a href="https://www.hgar.com/events/find-an-event?event=LE102725&ref=realestateindepth.com"><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/10/FINAL-YO3-NYC-REALTOR-Rally-10-27-25--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2588" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/FINAL-YO3-NYC-REALTOR-Rally-10-27-25--1-.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/FINAL-YO3-NYC-REALTOR-Rally-10-27-25--1-.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/FINAL-YO3-NYC-REALTOR-Rally-10-27-25--1-.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/FINAL-YO3-NYC-REALTOR-Rally-10-27-25--1-.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The $607-million project is believed to be one of the largest private industrial developments in the history of Orange County.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SLATE HILL—The 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon distribution facility project that was considered dead by many observers a few months ago is alive and well and secured critical height exception, special use permit and site plan approvals by the Wawayanda Planning Board on Oct. 22.</p><p>With little discussion, the Planning Board last night approved a minor lot line change and then the requested height exception, special use permit and project site plan approval by a near unanimous vote.</p><p>The $607-million project is believed to be one of the largest private industrial developments in the history of Orange County. The project proposed by a partnership of Scannell Properties and Amazon Services, LLC, calls for the construction of a five-story Amazon robotic fulfillment and distribution center on McBride Road in Slate Hill. Each floor (two below grade and three above grade) would total approximately 600,000 square feet. The 100-acre property is currently an active quarry.</p><p>With municipal and IDA approvals on the horizon, business leaders praised the Planning Board’s actions that will fuel significant tax revenue and the creation of many construction and permanent jobs.</p><blockquote>Commenting on the Planning Board’s approval of the project, Conor Eckert, president and chief executive officer of the Orange County Partnership said, “The approval of the Amazon project is a major win for Orange County and the Hudson Valley. It sends a strong signal that Orange County is open for business and ready to lead the next generation of economic development. This forward-thinking project will not only generate new jobs and strengthen the local tax base, but it also shows that Orange County is ready to compete nationally for high-impact, future-focused projects seeking locations in the Northeast.”</blockquote><p>According to documents filed with the Orange County Industrial Development Agency, the completed Amazon facility will create at least 750 new jobs within three years of completion of construction.</p><p>L. Todd Diorio, president of the Hudson Valley Building and Construction Trades Council, said after the Planning Board vote: “This is great. It has been a long process for us to get the approval. Scannell has been a friend with labor. We have site work getting ready to start, hopefully soon, with a union contractor.”</p><p>Diorio noted that to secure IDA incentives, the developer must adhere to the IDA’s local labor policy that requires at least 85% local labor work on the project. He said that he fully expects the project to be built predominantly by union tradesmen and that initial contracts that have been let appear to be going to union contractors. He estimated the development will result in more than 1 million construction man-hours to complete the facility.</p><p>Some observers had written off the project as dead back in June when the Town of Wawayanda’s Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously (4-0) to reject a needed height variance for the Amazon project. The Scannell project, also known as “Project Bluebird,” received a favorable negative declaration by the Planning Board in June on its requested special use permit. However, the project failed to garner the necessary height variance (from 35 feet to approximately 66 feet) from the ZBA to allow it to proceed any further.</p><p>Developer Scannell Properties re-emerged on Aug. 13 before the Wawayanda Planning Board stating that Town Code 195-13 specifically allows for a project to be granted a height exception if its fire-fighting capacity is sufficient and if its property buffers are greater than required.</p><p>Matt Boone, development manager of Indianapolis, IN-based Scannell Properties, testified before the Planning Board at that time that the project meets both exception requirements and that its fire suppression system had recently been approved by the Department of State. In terms of setbacks, Boone noted that the project offers setbacks that range between 650% to 2,000% greater than the setback requirements by the town.</p><p>A public hearing on the Scannell height variance request was held on Sept. 10 and at that session the Planning Board closed the public hearing.</p><p>The developer, in addition to seeking the Planning Board’s approval, has gone to court in connection with the ZBA denial. Scannell Development and the property owner Aden Slate Hill, LLC filed an Article 78 proceeding on July 24 in the New York State Supreme Court in Orange County against the Town of Wawayanda and the town’s Zoning Board of Appeals and is seeking to have the ZBA’s denial vote annulled and have the court compel the ZBA to approve Scannell’s height variance. Among its charges contained in the lawsuit, Scannell noted that the ZBA previously approved a similar height variance to Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) energy plant.</p><p>The Town of Wawayanda and ZBA have denied allegations contained in Scannell’s Article 78 proceeding and are seeking to have the court dismiss the litigation against both the Town of Wawayanda and its ZBA. It is not known at press time if the Scannell litigation against the town and ZBA is still pending.</p><p>Attorney and Democratic candidate for Orange County Executive Michael H. Sussman, Esq. announced on Oct. 14 that he had filed an Article 78 proceeding challenging the Wawayanda Planning Board’s negative declaration in June. The suit states that the Planning Board’s actions violated the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act. The litigation was filed on behalf of neighbor Diane O’Neill and the Save Wawayanda Inc. and Protect Orange County organizations.</p><p>Back in 2023, Scannell and Amazon secured approvals for a 900,000-square-foot warehouse at the 22 McBride Road site, but eventually submitted a much larger proposal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The role of an LPC includes attending public meetings, tracking local legislation, reporting back to HGAR’s Government Affairs team, and supporting the association’s broader communications strategy.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors officially launched its Local Political Coordinator Program, a new initiative designed to deepen relationships between Realtors and local officials who shape housing policy, property rights, and real estate regulations. The program marks a major step forward in HGAR’s ongoing commitment to expanding its advocacy footprint throughout the region.</p><p>Modeled after the successful Federal Political Coordinator program run by the National Association of Realtors and the statewide version championed by the New York State Association of Realtors, the LPC program brings that same advocacy structure to the hyperlocal level. Instead of engaging only with members of Congress or the State Legislature, HGAR’s LPCs will be assigned to local decision-makers—county executives, mayors, supervisors, city council members, housing committee chairs, and other municipal leaders who directly impact real estate in our communities.</p><p>In a hybrid kickoff event, more than 20 members from across the region came together to learn about the program’s goals, responsibilities, and strategic importance. The information session led by Government Affairs Director Alexander Roithmayr and Bronx and Manhattan Government Affairs Director Dr. Jermaine Meadows, with Legislative Chair Crystal Hawkins-Syska, laid out a clear vision for what the LPC program intends to accomplish.</p><p>At its core, the LPC initiative is about building a reliable, informed network of Realtors who can serve as trusted liaisons between the real estate industry and local elected officials. LPCs are not lobbyists, but constituents with hands-on knowledge of how local policies affect housing, property ownership and the overall real estate market. They are able and willing to speak to the practical impact of zoning changes, tax proposals and legislative efforts in their own communities.</p><p>Participants were introduced to the foundational elements of advocacy, described during the presentation as a “strategic and intentional process of using information, communication, and influence to bring about change.” HGAR emphasized that LPCs must be thoughtful, prepared, and professional in every interaction—and that the association’s advocacy remains firmly non-partisan. “We don’t do red or blue—we do purple,” attendees were told, underscoring the Realtor Party’s commitment to policy over politics.</p><p>The role of an LPC includes attending public meetings, tracking local legislation, reporting back to HGAR’s Government Affairs team, and supporting the association’s broader communications strategy. LPCs are also expected to adhere to HGAR’s media guidelines, with public messaging—whether in person or on social media—subject to preapproval to ensure consistency and professionalism.</p><p>A major theme throughout the training was the power of relationships. By establishing themselves as credible, accessible voices on real estate issues, LPCs position HGAR to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to local policy. When proposals such as Good Cause Eviction or local transfer taxes are being discussed, the goal is for elected officials to reach out to their assigned LPC for insight before moving forward.</p><blockquote>“Just as with our State and Federal Coordinator programs, building and maintaining strong relationships with local lawmakers is essential,” said Barry Kramer, past president of HGAR and long-time State Political Coordinator. “These connections can directly influence whether proposed legislation advances or is rejected. Local Political Coordinators play a vital role in shaping outcomes, with their efforts often leading to meaningful changes that benefit the communities they serve.”</blockquote><p>“The level of interest and participation was incredible—the energy in the room was exactly what we hoped for,” said Alex Roithmayr, Government Affairs Director for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors. “Our goal was to launch this program in a way that left members informed, inspired, and empowered to take the next step. We’ve got a lot of mountains to move and some good trouble to get into on the local level, and I think we’re off to a great start.”</p><p>Part of what makes the LPC program so significant is its ability to formalize work that HGAR members and staff have been doing informally for years—attending local fundraisers, engaging with municipal boards, and staying involved in community decision-making. Now, those one-on-one connections are being woven into a larger advocacy strategy that aligns with HGAR’s messaging, legislative priorities and long-term vision.</p><p>“My food is local, my life is local and now my advocacy is local. So much of the impact of policy decisions happens at the city, town and county level. As Realtors, it is important that we get involved on a local level to protect home ownership and equitable fair housing” said Rey Hollingsworth-Falu, HGAR President-Elect. “Our Local Political Coordinator program will have a positive impact in the Hudson Valley and beyond. Local advocacy will keep our neighborhoods strong. Local engagement will ensure a diverse, equitable and inclusive community. I'm so proud that Realtors are leading the way to better neighborhoods where anyone can find a home."</p><p>The launch of the LPC program follows years of steady growth in HGAR’s advocacy work. Recently, the association underwent a comprehensive strategic planning process that identified advocacy as one of its top priorities. Since then, CEO Lynda Fernandez and HGAR Presidents Carmen Bauman and Vlora Sejdi have led the charge, growing participation in Albany Lobby Day, organizing the first-ever NYC Day of Action alongside regional boards, and now, launching the LPC initiative to bring that momentum home.</p><p>“Advocacy remains at the heart of all that we do. We don’t just champion Realtors when engaging with elected officials. We advocate for homeowners, landlords, renters, and the need for fair and affordable housing. We’re advocating for my parents and yours” said 2025 HGAR President Sejdi.</p><p>“This year, we are showing HGAR’s dedication to expanding our advocacy efforts to include a stronger focus on local politicians. By engaging with community leaders alongside our state and federal representatives, we can ensure that the voice of Realtors is heard where it matters most—in our neighborhoods,” Sejdi added.</p><p>The LPC program is also closely tied to the efforts of the Realtors Political Action Committee (RPAC), which funds advocacy work at every level of government. During the session, RPAC Major Investors were recognized for their continued commitment, which has helped build the financial and organizational infrastructure that made the LPC program possible.</p><p>Recently, HGAR held a second LPC training session to review its local legislative agenda and leadership assignments. With this alignment of goals, HGAR now has more than two dozen HGAR members actively engaging with elected officials and strengthening local relationships. These connections include mayors, supervisors, county legislators, New York City Council Members and county executives.

    <description><![CDATA[As inventory inches up and prices continue to rise, more households are being locked out of homeownership and pushed into rental markets that cannot keep up. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWBURGH—Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress’ Center for Housing Solutions released its Q3 2025 Hudson Valley Regional Housing Market Report on Oct. 28. The report examined a number of trends within the regional housing market, and its constituent counties, including median sale prices, total volume of sales, total inventory on the market, and more.</p><p>Here are some key takeaways from the report.</p><p>The Hudson Valley home market has transitioned into a new stage. For the first time in more than seven years, the nine-county region has seen three consecutive quarters in which the quantity of new listings and the total inventory of homes for sale both increased. The gains are modest, the report stated. New listings and the total inventory of homes on the market both grew by about 100 to 200 homes compared to the third quarter last year.</p><p>This change is noteworthy because the Hudson Valley experienced six consecutive years of rising prices and declining stock for sale on the market. However, we should not expect regional market dynamics to change quickly. Compared to the pre-pandemic market, our region still has less than half the quantity of homes for sale. This supply constriction—along with other forces such as corporate homebuying and remote work - is likely to push home prices higher in the near term, Pattern for Progress officials stated.</p><p>Already-exorbitant home prices across the region shot even higher in the third quarter. Most notably, Columbia County saw its median home price exceed $500,000 for the first time ever. Statistically, Columbia County continues to have some of the deepest housing stress in the entire region. Westchester County crossed the $800,000 mark for the first time in a single quarter, while Sullivan County has seen its median home price skyrocket by 145% since 2019, the highest proportional increase in the entire region.</p><p>In the current market, homeownership is unattainable for those who want to own a piece of their community. This has a cascading effect, the report stated. More households are persisting in rentals, rents are increasing faster than wages, and more of our neighbors who relied on modest rents are slipping into the social safety net and being housing in hotels and motels. These realities must compel the region and the state to constantly examine programs, regulations, and actions. The Q3 data in this report underscore that housing must remain at the top of our civic priority list.</p><p>“The Hudson Valley’s housing outlook is changing, but not necessarily for the better,” Pattern CEO Adam Bosch said. “As inventory inches up and prices continue to rise, more households are being locked out of homeownership and pushed into rental markets that cannot keep up. This fuels higher rents, greater reliance on emergency housing, and a deepening strain on both our regional workforce and the well-being of our communities. The data in our report underscore that housing must remain at the top of our civic priority list in the Hudson Valley.”</p><h3 id="third-quarter-home-prices">Third Quarter Home Prices</h3><ul>
<li>Median home prices increased everywhere except Dutchess County.</li>
<li>The median home price in Columbia County exceeded $500,000 for the first time. A typical home in Columbia now costs more than homes in Orange and Dutchess.</li>
<li>Sullivan County has the largest proportional increase in its median home price since 2019. Its median home price is up by a whopping 145%.</li>
<li>The median home price in every county surpassed $350,000 for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="third-quarter-inventory-of-homes-for-sale">Third Quarter Inventory of Homes for Sale</h3><ul>
<li>The total inventory of homes for sale increased in Q1, Q2, and Q3 - the first-time inventory has increased in three consecutive quarters since the pandemic.</li>
<li>Compared to the pre-pandemic market, there are still less than half the quantity of homes on the market.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[For Realtors, this moment is about more than voting it’s about advocacy, leadership and accountability.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early voting in New York City is officially underway, marking one of the most consequential election cycles in recent memory. From now until Sunday, Nov. 2, New Yorkers have the opportunity to cast their ballots ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 4. While national headlines often dominate political conversations, this election carries deep local implications especially for housing, economic development, and the future of our city’s real estate landscape. </p><p>For Realtors, this moment is about more than voting it’s about advocacy, leadership and accountability. The decisions made at the ballot box will directly shape the way we build, buy and live in New York for generations to come.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/10/AdobeStock_814179012-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1121" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/AdobeStock_814179012-1.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/AdobeStock_814179012-1.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/AdobeStock_814179012-1.jpeg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/AdobeStock_814179012-1.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="why-this-election-matters-for-our-industry">Why This Election Matters for Our Industry</h3><p>New York City continues to face a critical shortage of affordable housing, complex land-use barriers, and aging infrastructure in need of modernization. Many of these challenges stem not from lack of will, but from outdated processes that slow progress and inflate costs.<br>That’s why the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors (HGAR), in partnership with associations across the city, has launched a nearly $400,000 issue mobilization campaign in support of Ballot Proposal 3—a measure designed to simplify and speed up the review process for modest housing and infrastructure projects.</p><p>If passed, Proposal 3 would create a new Expedited Land Use Review Procedure (ELURP) for smaller projects, helping cut through unnecessary delays that often add years and millions of dollars to developments. The proposal balances efficiency with community input, preserving local voices while ensuring critical housing and weather-resilience projects can move forward faster.</p><p>A “Yes” vote on Proposal 3 is a vote for common sense reform, job creation and housing opportunity. A “No” vote, on the other hand, keeps the status quo prolonging the costly seven-month Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) that continues to stall smaller projects and delay vital improvements across the city.</p><p>This is more than a policy adjustment it’s a chance to demonstrate that Realtors are at the forefront of solutions that make housing more attainable and equitable for all New Yorkers.</p><h3 id="the-power-of-realtor-advocacy">The Power of Realtor Advocacy</h3><p>Our collective voice is one of the strongest tools we have. Advocacy doesn’t end with a conversation it extends into action. The recent NYC Realtors Rally at City Hall Park, which brought together Realtors from all five boroughs, was a powerful demonstration of what collaboration and purpose can achieve.</p><p>When Realtors show up, policymakers listen. When Realtors speak, communities pay attention. We are not just participants in the housing market; we are partners in shaping its future.</p><p>As early voting continues, we must carry that same energy to the ballot box. Encourage your clients, colleagues, and neighbors to vote early, stay informed, and understand the importance of each proposal on the ballot. Elections decide policy and policy decides opportunity.</p><h3 id="how-to-get-involved">How to Get Involved</h3><p><strong>Vote early</strong>—Avoid long lines and make your voice count ahead of Election Day.</p><p><strong>Check your polling site</strong>—Early voting sites may differ from your Election Day location, verify before heading out at vote.nyc.</p><p><strong>Educate your network</strong>—Share credible information about Proposal 3 and other ballot initiatives.</p><p><strong>Engage beyond the election</strong>—Continue to participate in local hearings, housing policy discussions and Realtor advocacy efforts year-round.</p><h3 id="a-call-to-lead">A Call to Lead</h3><p>This election season is not just another political cycle it’s a call to leadership. Realtors are trusted community voices. When we stand together, we set the standard for civic engagement and responsible growth.</p><p>As we approach Nov. 4, let’s lead with knowledge, purpose and conviction. Let’s show what it means to build stronger communities not just through properties, but through policy. Because when Realtors vote, advocate, and engage, we don’t just sell homes we help shape the future of the city we all call home.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—The share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to the National Association of Realtors’ 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers released earlier today.</p><p>The annual survey of recent home buyers and sellers covers transactions between July 2024 and June 2025 and offers industry professionals, consumers, and policymakers detailed insights into homebuying and selling behavior.</p><blockquote>“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering. Today’s first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result.”</blockquote><p>“Unfolding in the housing market is a tale of two cities,” Lautz explained. “We’re seeing buyers with significant housing equity making larger down payments and all-cash offers, while first-time buyers continue to struggle to enter the market.”</p><p>“For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream,” said Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. “Delayed or denied homeownership until age 40 instead of 30 can mean losing roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. FHA and VA programs have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, join the middle class, and create intergenerational wealth – a testament to smart government policy in support of homeownership.”</p><p>“Today, we must focus on policies that address the root cause of the affordability crisis: inadequate housing supply,” McGahn added. “That means both unlocking existing inventory and enabling new construction. We need solutions that encourage more owners to sell, revitalize underused properties, streamline local zoning and permitting barriers, and modernize construction methods to build more homes faster and more affordably. These commonsense reforms make homes more affordable, restore opportunity, and help revive the dream of homeownership for generations to come.”</p><h3 id="first-time-buyers">First-Time Buyers</h3><ul>
<li>Median Age: 40 Years Old</li>
<li>10% median down payment – matching the highest level recorded since 1989</li>
<li>Top Sources for Down Payment:<br>
Personal savings (59%)<br>
Financial assets – such as a 401(k), stocks, or cryptocurrency (26%)<br>
Gifts or loans from family and friends (22%).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="repeat-buyers">Repeat Buyers</h3><ul>

<li>24% have children under the age of 18 living at home – an all-time low</li>
<li>14% purchased a multigenerational home – down from 17% in 2024</li>
<li>Top reasons cited for purchasing a multigenerational home:<br>

<li>91% of buyers would use their agent again or recommend them to others</li>
<li>91% of sellers used an agent – equal to the highest percentage on record.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Real estate agents remain indispensable in today’s complex housing market,” Lautz said. “Beyond guiding buyers and sellers through what is often the largest financial decision of their lives, agents provide critical expertise, negotiation skills, and emotional support during an increasingly challenging process.”</p><p>Learn more and download highlights from the report at <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers">https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New York recorded the lowest turnover rate among the top 50 metros, with only around 10 out of every 1,000 homes selling in the first nine months of the year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEATTLE —Only 28 out of every 1,000 (2.8%) U.S. homes have changed hands in 2025—the lowest turnover rate in at least 30 years. That’s according to a new report from Redfin.</p><p>Redfin’s analysis examined the period between 2012-2025, but it can confidently say this year’s 2.8% turnover rate is the lowest since at least the early-mid 1990s. Existing home sales back then were similar to this year, but the number of homes that existed was smaller—meaning the turnover rate was higher.</p><h3 id="38-fewer-homes-sold-this-year-than-during-the-pandemic-peak">38% Fewer Homes Sold This Year than During the Pandemic Peak</h3><p>This year’s turnover rate (2.77%) was down ever so slightly from 2.78% last year, when existing home sales fell to the lowest level since 1995.</p><p>There were 37.7% fewer homes sold this year than during the middle of the pandemic buying frenzy in 2021 (44 of every 1,000), and 31.2% fewer homes sold than during the last pre-pandemic year in 2019 (40 of every 1,000).</p><p>Homes are turning over at historically low rates because:</p><ul>
<li>Affordability challenges have kept many buyers on the sidelines. Home prices are near record highs, and borrowing costs remain elevated, causing the number of sellers to far outweigh the number of buyers.</li>
<li>Sellers are unwilling to give up their low mortgage rates. More than 70% of mortgaged U.S. homeowners have a rate below 5%, well below the current rate of 6.17%. While the share of mortgages above 6% is at a 10-year high, many homeowners are still rate-locked and unwilling to sell.</li>
<li>Economic uncertainty has made buyers cautious. Concerns about job security, inflation, and broader instability caused many would-be movers to delay major purchases, further slowing the pace of transactions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“America’s housing market is defined right now by caution,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s head of economics research. “Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit. Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS– In response to strong local housing demand and a continued focus on client service,<strong> ERA Insite Realty</strong> reported that it is expanding its team of real estate professionals.</p><p>Principal Broker Lou Budetti recently announced the addition of five new agents across the firm’s Westchester County offices. Joining the White Plains office is <strong>Tiffany Longman</strong>; the Bronxville office welcomes <strong>Rachel Diamond</strong> and <strong>Ericarme “Erica” Renois</strong>; and joining the Pleasantville office are <strong>Michelle Colabatistto</strong> and <strong>Laureen Circosta</strong>.</p><p>Longman joins ERA Insite after seven years with an ERA-affiliated brokerage in Washington State. Recently licensed in New York and Connecticut, she is transitioning her business eastward to be closer to her two sons.

Before earning her real estate license, she spent two years as a licensed Real Estate Appraisal Assistant, gaining valuable insight into property valuation and market trends. Her earlier roles in communications at Saks Fifth Avenue and the Associated Press, combined with her nonprofit experience, have honed her skills in client service, research and marketing, the brokerage stated.</p><p>Renois, originally from Haiti, is fluent in French, Haitian Creole, and English. She brings more than 15 years of office administration experience and a deep passion for helping others achieve life-changing goals, an inspiration drawn from her own journey after immigrating to the U.S. following Haiti’s 2010 earthquake.</p><p>Colabatistto, a Valhalla resident, returns to ERA Insite after taking time away from real estate. She is a graduate of Our Lady of Victory and Berkeley College. Her experience working in the Town of Mount Pleasant Tax Department provides her with valuable insight into local government operations and the property tax process.</p><p>Circosta earned her Bachelor’s degree in Health &amp; Exercise Science from Rowan University in New Jersey. She brings extensive experience in operations management within the health and wellness industry, where she developed a client-centered approach and a focus on achieving measurable goals. A California native, she now lives in Ossining.</p><blockquote>“Each of these five agents brings a unique perspective and distinct skill set that will directly benefit the clients they serve,” said Lou Budetti, Principal Broker at ERA Insite Realty. “All have completed our comprehensive training program and are supported by our experienced management and administrative teams. We’re proud to continue attracting both established professionals and rising talent who share our commitment to exceptional client service.”</blockquote><p>ERA Insite Realty Services, part of the ERA global network, has served the Westchester and Fairfield County markets for 40 years from its headquarters at 600 North Broadway in White Plains.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We did it, and Realtors and New York City move forward because of it. </p><p>This Election Day marks a historic victory for housing progress and for our industry, as voters overwhelmingly approved Proposal 3: “Simplify Review of Modest Housing and Infrastructure Projects.” This measure, now officially passed, will make it easier to create small‐scale housing and community projects in neighborhoods across the city by introducing a new Expedited Land Use Review Process (ELURP).</p><p>Under the newly approved process, modest developments including those rezoning buildings up to 45 feet tall (roughly four stories) in low‐density districts will now undergo a streamlined, 60‐day review by the Community Board and the Borough President, followed by a 30‐day review and final decision by the City Planning Commission. In most cases, this reform removes the final approval step from the City Council, significantly reducing the time and bureaucracy that have slowed much-needed housing projects for years.</p><p>This is a major policy win for Realtors and for the thousands of New Yorkers who have been calling for sensible housing reform. The Expedited Land Use Review Process will help cut through red tape, unlock new opportunities for small housing and infrastructure projects, and ultimately make it easier to bring attainable homes to market.</p><p>Our association and members were deeply engaged in this effort. From the earliest planning stages to Election Day, we ran a strategic, citywide campaign that reached millions of residents across all five boroughs. Through rallies, neighborhood outreach, and educational efforts, Realtors helped make the case for a smarter, fairer review process and New Yorkers listened. The passage of Proposal 3 is not just a victory at the ballot box; it’s a testament to what coordinated advocacy and partnership can accomplish when our mission is clear: more housing opportunities for all.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/11/5044E773-EFC0-40C4-8748-070B5A69F960_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1086" height="724" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/5044E773-EFC0-40C4-8748-070B5A69F960_1_105_c.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/5044E773-EFC0-40C4-8748-070B5A69F960_1_105_c.jpeg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/11/5044E773-EFC0-40C4-8748-070B5A69F960_1_105_c.jpeg 1086w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Realtors and staff gather from HGAR, LIBOR and the Brooklyn Board of Realtors at the Realtors Rally held at City Hall on Oct. 27.</em></i></figcaption></figure><h3 id="realtors-rally-for-housing-at-city-hall">Realtors Rally for Housing at City Hall</h3><p>A key moment in this campaign came on October 27th, when we hosted a Realtors Rally at City Hall in partnership with Realtor associations across New York City. This powerful show of unity brought together members, housing advocates, and city leaders to voice strong support for Proposal 3. Standing on the steps of City Hall, Realtors from across the five boroughs sent a clear message—New York needs more housing, and we are ready to be part of the solution.</p><p>The rally underscored our industry’s leadership in advancing housing policy and demonstrated the collective strength of Realtors when we unite around a common cause. It was a defining moment that helped build momentum leading up to Election Day and it clearly made an impact.</p><h3 id="election-highlights-new-leadership-for-a-new-chapter">Election Highlights: New Leadership for a New Chapter</h3><p>Beyond the ballot measures, Election Day also brought a new political landscape to New York City. Former Assembly member Zohran Mamdani has been elected as the city’s next mayor, ushering in a new era of leadership and vision. The results also brought changes in several key offices, including borough presidents, the comptroller, public advocate and the city council.</p><p>This transition signals an important opportunity for Realtors and housing advocates alike. The incoming administration has signaled a strong focus on affordability, equitable growth, and land‐use modernization priorities that align closely with the mission of our industry. With Proposal 3 now law, the timing couldn’t be better to engage with city leadership and ensure that implementation reflects both community priorities and real‐world housing needs.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/11/75BA7277-6120-4A94-A680-EC1A6EC82B0A_1_105_c-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="724" height="902" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/75BA7277-6120-4A94-A680-EC1A6EC82B0A_1_105_c-1.jpeg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/11/75BA7277-6120-4A94-A680-EC1A6EC82B0A_1_105_c-1.jpeg 724w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, Kevin Brady, Government Affairs Director with the Long Island Board of Realtors and Dr. Jermaine Meadows, Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></i></figcaption></figure><h3 id="what-this-means-for-realtors-and-nyc-housing">What This Means for Realtors and NYC Housing</h3><p>The momentum is clear: voters want progress on housing. The success of Proposal 3 demonstrates that New Yorkers are ready for solutions that balance growth with thoughtful community input. For Realtors, this victory reinforces our credibility as trusted housing advocates not only for buyers and sellers, but for the overall economic vitality of our city.</p><p>As the new administration prepares to take office, our focus now shifts to collaboration and implementation. We’ll continue working with city officials, community boards, and development partners to ensure the new ELURP process delivers on its promise: faster, fairer, and more predictable pathways to build the homes New Yorkers need.</p><p>Voters also approved three other housing propositions. Voters approved Proposition 2, which fast-tracks affordable housing approvals; Proposition 4, which creates an affordable housing appeals board and Proposition 5, which seeks to consolidate and digitize the city’s mapping systems.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3><p>This is more than a policy win; it’s a turning point. We’ve proven that when Realtors lead with expertise, integrity, and collaboration, we can shape the future of housing policy in meaningful ways.</p><p>To every member who participated in this campaign by volunteering, advocating, or simply voting—thank you. Your voice made the difference.</p><p>The work continues, but today, we celebrate. Proposal 3 is a win for housing. A win for progress. And a win for Realtors across New York City.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Home prices rose in 77% of metro markets (176 out of 230) during the third quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors latest quarterly report released today.

Four percent of metro areas recorded double-digit price gains in the third quarter, down slightly from 5% in the second quarter of 2025.</p><p>The national median single-family existing-home price grew 1.7% year over year to $426,800—the same annual growth rate recorded in the second quarter.</p><p>Median existing single-family home price by region (year-over-year change)</p><p><strong>Northeast: $540,100 (+6.0%)<br>Midwest: $331,100 (+4.2%)<br>South: $372,800 (+0.5%)<br>West: $633,900 (-0.1%)</strong></p><blockquote>“Home sales have struggled to gain traction, but prices continue to rise, contributing to record-high housing wealth,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Markets in the supply-constrained Northeast and the more affordable Midwest have generally seen stronger price appreciation.”</blockquote><p>“Price declines are occurring mainly in southern states, where there has been robust new home construction in recent years,” added Yun. “Given the region’s faster job growth, these price drops should be viewed as temporary and as a second-chance opportunity for those previously priced out of the market.”</p><h3 id="10-large-markets-with-biggest-year-over-year-median-price-increases">10 Large Markets with Biggest Year-Over-Year Median Price Increases</h3><p>Trenton, NJ (+9.9%)<br>Lansing-East Lansing, MI (+9.8%)<br>Nassau County-Suffolk County, NY (+9.4%)<br>New Haven-Milford, CT (+9.0%)<br><strong>New York-Jersey City-White Plains, NY-NJ (+8.1%)</strong><br>Manchester-Nashua, NH (+8.0%)<br>St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MORRIS PLAINS, NJ — <strong>Weichert, Realtors </strong>reported today that <strong>David Murawinski</strong> has been named regional president of North Jersey/New York. In this role, Murawinski will be responsible for the management and growth of 11 Weichert offices located throughout Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties in New Jersey; New York City; and Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Westchester counties in New York.</p><p>Murawinski was previously branch vice president, coaching and guiding the sales associates at Weichert’s Upper Montclair, NJ sales office.</p><blockquote>“I am thrilled to welcome David to the leadership team at Weichert,” said Joe McDonald, president of Residential Sales and Real Estate Services for Weichert, Realtors. “David is a great inspiration for his sales team. His attention to detail, dynamic personality and dedication to ensuring that every client has a positive customer experience have been key in growing his business and office productivity. Under David’s leadership, I am confident the North Jersey/New York Region is well-positioned to reach new benchmarks of success.”</blockquote><p>With more than 22 years of industry experience, Murawinski’s interest in real estate was sparked by the purchase of his first home. He earned his real estate license in 2003 while working as a detective with the Jersey City Police Department, helping clients buy and sell homes with Century 21 Gemini for 10 years before joining Weichert in 2015. Murawinski retired from the police force after 25 years of service and became a full-time Weichert sales associate in 2022. He was named branch vice president of Weichert’s Upper Montclair office in November 2024.</p><p>“For most people, buying or selling a home may be the largest transaction of their life. As real estate professionals, our job is to provide guidance, protect their best interests, and help facilitate smooth transactions,” Murawinski said. “As regional president, I am looking forward to guiding the sales leaders under my leadership, so they can best implement Weichert’s ‘people first’ philosophy to serve our clients while increasing productivity, recruiting new agents and reaching new benchmarks of success.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“Next year is really the year that we will see a measurable increase in sales,” Yun said]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOUSTON—Existing-home sales are projected to rebound, rising by approximately 14% in 2026, according to National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, who delivered his 2026 housing outlook on Nov. 14 during the Residential Economic Issues and Trends Forum at the NAR NXT, The Realtor Experience conference here.</p><p>Yun said the expected rebound reflects easing mortgage rates, continued job gains, and improving market stability after several challenging years. Home prices are forecast to increase by 4% next year, supported by steady demand and persistent supply shortages.</p><blockquote>“Next year is really the year that we will see a measurable increase in sales,” Yun said. “Home prices nationwide are in no danger of declining.”</blockquote><p>Mortgage rates are projected to decline modestly, averaging around 6% in 2026. Yun emphasized that while rates are influenced by more than Federal Reserve decisions alone, broader economic factors are contributing to gradually lower borrowing costs.</p><p>“As we go into next year, the mortgage rate will be a little bit better,” said Yun. “It’s not going to be a big decline, but it will be a modest decline that will improve affordability.”</p><p>Buyers will see the greatest affordability improvements in regions where new housing supply is most robust, particularly high-construction markets like Houston. Expanding inventory in such areas will help more first-time buyers achieve homeownership.</p><p>“Houston is creating more home construction, and therefore making home prices much more reasonable,” said Yun. “Given the job creation, buyers will inevitably be showing up to Houston once the mortgage rate goes down.”</p><p>Jessica Lautz, NAR’s deputy chief economist and vice president of research, presented insights from the newly released 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, highlighting how shifting demographics are reshaping today’s housing market.</p><p>Lautz noted that the typical age of a home buyer today is 59 and the typical age of a repeat buyer is 62. She also shared that the number one reason people move today is because they want to be closer to friends and family.</p><p>“I call this the grandbaby effect,” Lautz said. “This is a different type of buyer.”</p><p>In contrast, first-time buyers continue to face steep challenges, with the share of first-time buyers hitting an all-time low of 21% and the median first-time buyer age reaching 40.</p><p>The median first-time buyer age has risen sharply over the past three years. NAR reported in 2024 that the median first-time homebuyer age was 38, which was three years older than the median of 35 years of age the association reported a year earlier.</p><p>“The biggest struggle first-time buyers have is finding an affordable property, and many of them struggle to save for a down payment,” said Lautz. “The biggest source of pain that they are citing is high rent and student loan debt.”</p><p>Despite the affordability challenges, use of real estate agents remains strong among both buyers and sellers. Lautz shared that 88% of buyers and 91% of sellers used an agent or broker in their most recent transaction.</p><p>Lautz cited the value agents provide in “pricing the home competitively in a changing market, marketing that home, and finding a qualified buyer.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plan is being touted as “the largest transformation in real estate history.”</p><p>NAR officials stated the new strategic plan is grounded in industry insights and shaped by outreach to more than 150,000 voices across each level of the association and the industry. It provides a roadmap that will modernize the organization and transform the member experience. The plan will be implemented on Jan. 1, 2026.</p><blockquote>“NAR is rebuilding trust by executing the largest transformation in real estate history, and this Strategic Plan will be our roadmap,” said NAR CEO Nykia Wright. “The plan is data-informed to ensure that NAR is investing in initiatives that members and the industry find most valuable. It also includes success metrics so our members and the industry can hold NAR accountable to the commitments we are making.”</blockquote><p>Wright, appearing at HGAR’s “Impact: The Member Experience” event on Sept. 29 in White Plains, previewed the new Strategic Plan and described how the National Association of Realtors has emerged from a tumultuous period of scandal and litigation to focus on providing key services and information to its membership.</p><p>NAR’s Wright stressed at the HGAR event her strong commitment to the association’s mantra of “helping Realtors get to the next transaction.”</p><p>NAR officials noted that by executing the Strategic Plan, NAR will modernize the association, deliver greater member value, respond to an evolving industry landscape, and provide transparent metrics to hold the association accountable. The three-year plan is the product of listening to members and industry stakeholders. Based on what NAR heard from members, the association identified the 24 initiatives members would find most valuable to their membership experience. Those 24 initiatives are how NAR will fulfill the commitments the association is making to members, partners, industry and consumers.</p><h2 id="the-commitments">The Commitments</h2><h3 id="building-the-future-member-experience"><br>Building the Future Member Experience</h3><ul>

    <description><![CDATA[Owners who delegate rent-setting to third-party property managers, real estate brokerage firms and brokers that also offer property management services, or owners who use national “revenue management” platforms should review and update their contracts well before the Dec. 15, 2025, effective date.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Oct. 16, 2025, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law Senate Bill S.7882 (see <a href="https://bit.ly/4r5D82W">https://bit.ly/4r5D82W</a>) (the “Section 340-B”), making New York the first state in the country to explicitly ban certain algorithmic rent-setting tools used by landlords and property managers. The new law takes effect on Dec. 15, 2025.</p><p>The legislation amends New York’s antitrust statute, the Donnelly Act (see <a href="https://bit.ly/4oMsVXD">https://bit.ly/4oMsVXD</a>), by adding General Business Law § 340-B, entitled “Agreements to not compete with respect to residential rental dwelling units.”</p><h3 id="national-focus-litigation-relating-to-algorithmic-pricing-tools">National Focus, Litigation Relating to Algorithmic Pricing Tools</h3><p>Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice and multiple state Attorneys General have sued RealPage and major landlords, alleging that the software they utilize allows landlords to share non-public, competitively sensitive data and align rents in violation of federal antitrust laws. In the August 2025 edition of <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, Legal Corner highlighted the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and eight states against RealPage and others. (See <a href="https://bit.ly/4p5tBaa">https://bit.ly/4p5tBaa</a>) ; see also DOJ Press Release at <a href="https://bit.ly/4r6h8oK">https://bit.ly/4r6h8oK</a>). New York’s decision to enact this new antitrust legislation comes amid this nationwide backlash against rent-setting algorithms.</p><p>Several cities have adopted local bans or restrictions on these tools. (See <a href="https://bit.ly/3LE05tP">https://bit.ly/3LE05tP</a>). California recently amended its Cartwright Act to restrict “common pricing algorithms” across industries, including housing. (See <a href="https://bit.ly/4iblAyf">https://bit.ly/4iblAyf</a>). New York is the first state to enact statewide legislation. New York’s statute is narrower in scope as it applies only to “residential rental dwelling units.” It specifically provides that the use of certain algorithmic tools is a “per se” violation of the Donnelly Act (New York’s antitrust law).</p><h3 id="section-340-b-new-york%E2%80%99s-newest-addition-to-the-donnelly-act">Section 340-B: New York’s Newest Addition to the Donnelly Act</h3><p>It is critical now for all property owners, property managers, lenders, and real estate professionals, including real estate brokers, agents and attorneys in New York, to understand that Section 340-B is not a simple technology rule. Section 340-B defines specific conduct involving algorithms as an antitrust violation under the Donnelly Act. The legislative summary explains that Section 340-B “prohibits a person or entity from knowingly or with reckless disregard facilitate an agreement between or among two or more residential rental property owners or managers to not compete with respect to residential rental dwelling units….”</p><p>The summary further explains that any actions by individuals or entities, “including by operating or licensing a software, data analytics service, or algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function on behalf of or between and among such residential rental property owners or managers,” will subject individuals and entities to liability under the Donnelly Act. This broad language may subject real estate brokerage firms and their agents to liability if they utilize these tools on behalf of their owner clients or their property managers.</p><p><em>Unlawful Facilitation by Vendors and Intermediaries</em></p><p>It is unlawful for any person or entity to “knowingly or with reckless disregard” facilitate an agreement between or among two or more residential rental property owners or managers “to not compete” with respect to residential units by: “operating, licensing, or otherwise providing software, a data analytics service, or an algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function on behalf of or between and among residential rental property owners or managers.” In other words, software providers and other intermediaries, such as real estate brokerage firms and management companies, can be direct antitrust violators when they offer tools that coordinate rent-setting with information received from multiple landlords.</p><p><em>Unlawful Agreements by Owners and Managers</em></p><p>Separately, the statute makes it an unlawful agreement for residential rental property owners or managers to: “set or adjust rental prices, lease renewal terms, occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions based on recommendations from a software, data analytics service, or algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function.” Using those recommendations as a basis for rent or lease decisions is enough to create liability.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-%E2%80%98coordinating-function%E2%80%99">What is a ‘Coordinating Function’?</h3><p>The definition of a “coordinating function” is the heart of the statute. A tool has a coordinating function if it does all three of the following, using information from two or more residential owners/managers that are not under common ownership:</p><p>“(i) collecting historical or contemporaneous prices, supply levels, or lease or rental contract termination and renewal dates of residential dwelling units from two or more residential rental property owners or managers, provided that at least two such residential rental property owners or managers are not wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same parent entity or otherwise owned or managed by the same residential rental property owner or manager;</p><p>(ii) analyzing or processing the information described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph using a system, software, or process that uses computation, including by using that information to train an algorithm; and</p><p>(iii) recommending rental prices, lease renewal terms, ideal occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions to a residential rental property owner or manager.”</p><p>If a tool only uses one owner’s own portfolio (plus, for example, public market listings) and does not ingest or analyze proprietary data from unaffiliated landlords, it will generally fall outside this definition.</p><h3 id="who-is-covered-and-when">Who is Covered and When?</h3><p>The parties covered under Section 340-B are “residential rental property owners or managers,” which are defined as “any individual or entity that owns or is a beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, or manages one or more residential rental dwelling units in New York State.”</p><p>Section 340-B also covers any person or entity that “knowingly or with reckless disregard facilitate[s] an agreement between or among two or more residential rental property owners or managers to not compete with respect to residential rental dwelling units, including by operating or licensing a software, data analytics service, or algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function on behalf of or between and among such residential rental property owners or managers.”</p><h3 id="remedies-and-liabilities-under-the-donnelly-act">Remedies and Liabilities Under The Donnelly Act</h3><p>Since Section 340-B is part of the Donnelly Act, existing antitrust remedies would apply. Enforcement of any antitrust violation would come under the authority of the New York State Attorney General. Additionally, any private individual suing under Section 340-B would be entitled to “treble” (i.e., triple) damages as well as attorney’s fees. Lastly, there is potential parallel exposure under federal antitrust law (Sherman Act) on the same facts.</p><h3 id="practical-impact-on-transactions-and-due-diligence">Practical Impact on Transactions and Due Diligence</h3><p><br><em>Property Management and Vendor Agreements</em></p><p>Owners who delegate rent-setting to third-party property managers, real estate brokerage firms and brokers that also offer property management services, or owners who use national “revenue management” platforms should review and update their contracts well before the Dec. 15, 2025, effective date. There is not much time left, but failing to do so could expose owners and property managers to severe risk and extensive monetary damages relating to antitrust violations. It is recommended that there be a review of management agreements and vendor contracts for representations, covenants, and indemnities relating to compliance with antitrust and other laws.</p><p><em>Property Management, Vendor and Software Agreements</em></p><p>Owners should add express prohibitions in property management agreements with their property managers that: (i) the property manager will not use any software or service that performs a “coordinating function” under GBL § 340-B for New York units, and (ii) the property manager will not base rent, renewal, or occupancy decisions for New York units on recommendations from such tools.</p><p>Owners should also add representations and disclosures that the property manager (i) does not currently use prohibited tools in connection with the property, (ii) will disclose all pricing and revenue-management tools used, and (iii) will not adopt any new tools without the owner’s prior written consent. Additionally, the owner should add express indemnifications and indemnitees arising from the property manager’s violation of Section 340-B, and also add express termination provisions.</p><p>Owners and managers should also review and include pertinent representations and indemnification provisions in any vendor and/or software contracts with their counsel, and require vendor representations that the software does not perform a “coordinating function” in violation of Section 340-B.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-brokers-and-other-real-estate-professionals">What This Means for Brokers and Other Real Estate Professionals</h3><p>Brokers and other real estate professionals should be prepared to raise the issue with their clients. It is recommended that brokers and agents instruct their clients to consult with their legal counsel regarding their use of pricing or revenue-management tools. Attorneys should alert their owner, property manager and other clients to the new requirements of the Section 340-B.</p><p>As with all antitrust discussions, real estate brokers and agents must inform their clients of this new antitrust exposure, and that these issues can result in regulatory investigations; civil lawsuits (including potential class actions); and disputes between the parties over undisclosed legal risks. Brokers who also provide property-management or asset-management services through affiliated entities must be especially careful that any in-house tools or third-party platforms they use for rent-setting compliance are reviewed and, if necessary, reconfigured or replaced.</p><p><em>About the author: Legal Corner Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Market conditions remain constrained, with overall inventory down 5.6% from the previous year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—The New York Metropolitan area real estate market demonstrated consistent, moderate price appreciation in October 2025, according to the latest regional market summary released by OneKey MLS. The regional median sales price across all property types—including the Bronx, Queens, Westchester, Long Island, and surrounding counties—climbed to $680,000, marking a strong 4.6% increase year-over-year.</p><p>The regional single-family home segment remains robust, with the median sales price reaching $740,000. The condo market showed strength in sales growth, with median prices rising to $525,000 as buyers continued to seek alternatives to higher-priced single-family properties. Overall, closed sales activity was also positive, increasing by 3.0% year-over-year, indicating resilient buyer confidence despite enduring supply shortages.</p><p>Market conditions remain constrained, with overall inventory down 5.6% from the previous year. This tightness is most pronounced in core suburban counties like Nassau and Suffolk, where limited listings are driving firm pricing. Northern counties like Orange and Dutchess, while seeing slower transaction paces, are offering more balanced conditions.</p><blockquote>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, commented on the October housing market, stating: “October’s results underscore the consistent strength and resilience of the Metropolitan New York housing market. Despite rising median prices—now at $680,000 across all property types, demand continues to outpace supply, particularly for single-family homes and condos in the core suburban counties. As we look toward 2026, the overall market remains remarkably stable. The key factors influencing our path forward will undoubtedly be the trajectory of mortgage rates and the much-needed increase in new listings to alleviate current inventory constraints.”</blockquote><p>The market outlook projects steady conditions continuing into early 2026, supported by consistent buyer demand and limited inventory. Price growth is expected to continue at moderate levels, with significant shifts depending on external economic factors and the pace of new listings entering the market.</p><h2 id="hgar-market-area-snapshot">HGAR Market Area Snapshot</h2><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $700,000, +3.7% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Home Sales: +37.1% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $350,000, +25% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Sales: +26.3% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $240,000, -4% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Sales: +8.9% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Inventory: +19.4%</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $483,750, -0.1% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Home Sales: -16.9% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $292,500, -7.1% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Sales: -41.5% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $130,000, -24.6% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Sales: +50% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Inventory: +6.0%</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $605,000, +1.7% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Home Sales: +29.1% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $631,500 +80.4% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Sales: +53.8% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Inventory: -1.5%</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $735,000, -2.0% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Home Sales: +11.6% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $423,500, +5.2% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Sales: -22.7% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $140,000, -24.3% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Sales: +80% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Inventory: +9.6%</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $399,000, +16.7% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Home Sales: +4.3% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $175,000, -30% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Sales: +0.0% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Inventory: +20.0%</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $950,000, +8.9% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Home Sales: +2.0% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $520,000, +0.0% from Oct. 2024<br>Condo Sales: +25.0% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $227,500, +13.8% from Oct. 2024<br>Co-Op Sales: -13.8% from Oct. 2024<br>Single-Family Inventory: -13.0%<br><br><em>SOURCE: ONEKEY MLS</em></p><p>To access all local and regional housing market reports, visit <a href="https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/">https://marketstats.onekeymls.com</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Real estate firms are bracing for continued challenges related to housing affordability and rising industry costs, according to the 2025 Profile of Real Estate Firms published by the National Association of Realtors today.</p><h3 id="top-challenges-for-real-estate-firms">Top Challenges for Real Estate Firms:</h3><ul>
<li>Housing affordability (56%)</li>
<li>Industry costs (36%, up from 34% in 2023)</li>
<li>Local economic conditions (35%, up from 34% in 2023)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these challenges, 38% of firms expect their profitability to increase in 2025, up from 30% in 2023—the last time this survey was conducted.</p><blockquote>“Real estate firms are on the frontlines of the industry and are seeing firsthand how housing affordability and local economic conditions are impacting their clients,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist. “Firms are also experiencing the rising cost of running their businesses. While the current real estate market is challenging, the majority of firms expect profitability to at least remain stable.”</blockquote><p>The report measures characteristics of real estate firms nationwide to determine how they operate and assess what lies ahead. NAR surveyed its broker members to better understand firms’ demographics, composition and characteristics from the executive and manager perspective.</p><h3 id="additional-key-findings-from-the-report">Additional Key Findings from the Report:</h3><ul>
<li>46% of sales volume is generated from repeat business and 44% from past client referrals.</li>
<li>35% of firms are actively recruiting—down 5% from 2023.</li>
<li>81% of real estate firms have a single office (identical to 2023), with two full-time real estate licensees on average (down from three in 2023).</li>
<li>19 years: The amount of time the average residential firm has been operating (up from 16 years in 2023).</li>
<li>25 years: The amount of time the average commercial firm has been operating (identical to 2023).</li>

    <description><![CDATA[Year-over-year sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest and South, and decreased in the West.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales increased by 1.2% in October, according to the National Association of Realtors Existing-Home Sales Report released earlier today.</p><p>Month-over-month sales increased in the Midwest and South, showed no change in the Northeast, and fell in the West. Year-over-year sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest and South, and decreased in the West.</p><blockquote>“Home sales increased in October even with the government shutdown due to homebuyers taking advantage of lower mortgage rates,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices. First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.”</blockquote><p>“Rents are decelerating, which will reduce inflation and encourage the Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates and pulling back their quantitative tightening,” Yun added. “This will help bring more homebuyers into the market since the Fed rate has an indirect impact on mortgage rates.”</p><h2 id="national-snapshot">National Snapshot</h2><h3 id="total-existing-home-sales-for-october"><br>Total Existing-Home Sales for October</h3><ul>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in October increased by 1.9% from the prior month and fell 0.4% year over year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report released today.</p><p>Month-over-month pending home sales rose in the Northeast (2.3%, Midwest (5.3%) and South (1.4%) and declined in the West (1.5%). Year-over-year pending home sales increased in the Midwest and South, and decreased in the Northeast and West.</p><p>October’s Realtors Confidence Index survey shows that 17% of NAR members expect an increase in buyer traffic over the next three months, down from 20% September and 19% one year ago.

    <description><![CDATA[The $607-million Amazon project is believed to be among the largest private industrial development investments and the largest in terms of scope in the history of Orange County.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SLATE HILL—The project to develop a 3.2-million-square-foot Amazon fulfillment center here is once again facing a significant roadblock. The state-appointed monitor of the Orange County Industrial Development Agency has vetoed an approximately $80-million incentive package and PILOT granted by the IDA for the $607-million project late last month.</p><p>Orange County IDA Monitor Brian Sanvidge issued a “Notice of Violation” on Tuesday (Nov. 25) in connection with the project proposed by Scannell Properties of Indianapolis, IN, on behalf of Amazon. The Notice of Violation, obtained by <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, states that “the October 23, 2025 Authorizing Resolution relating to the OCIDA approval of the Scannell Properties #600, LLC and Amazon.com Services LLC project is not legally binding or effective and may not be reconsidered by OCIDA for at least ten days or until the next board meeting.”</p><p>According to its calendar, the next Orange County IDA meeting is scheduled on Wednesday, Dec. 17. The IDA had authorized $31,008,750 in sales and use tax exemptions along with a 15-year PILOT agreement on Oct. 23. The total incentive package was estimated at approximately $80 million.</p><p>The state-appointed IDA monitor was appointed on March 1, 2024 by the New York State Inspector General. New York State Senator James Skoufis, a frequent critic of the Orange County IDA, was successful in having the monitor position created as part of budget negotiations at the time.</p><p>Sanvidge in his violation notice stated that he received a letter from Senator Skouﬁs on Oct. 24 stating that the authorization by OCIDA was “a clear, unequivocal violation of the Uniform Tax Exemption Policy (UTEP)” and that the “OCIDA failed to “assess . . . the quality and salary of jobs projected to be created, onsite childcare provided by the applicant to prospective employees, demonstrated public support for the project, the effect of the proposed project on the environment, and the need for additional municipal services.”</p><blockquote>Senator Skoufis issued a statement on social media on the IDA Monitor’s ruling, stating that the IDA incentives are “not warranted or needed.” He said, “I am grateful to the state-appointed monitor, Brian Sanvidge, for his unbiased and thoughtful veto of this reckless giveaway. The monitor’s action protects Orange County's taxpayers and represents exactly why I successfully fought so hard to have a monitor installed: The IDA has lost all trust as they, without exception, continue to put corporate interests ahead of taxpayer interests.”</blockquote><blockquote>He added, “While this veto holds the Orange County IDA accountable for their rogue, reckless behavior, it also provides them an opportunity to hit a reset button and reconsider how to proceed in a manner that protects our community's hardworking taxpayers.”</blockquote><p>Orange County IDA Chairman Jeff Crist responded to Sen. Skoufis’ statement, stating, “All we are trying to do is use our state-given tools to secure 750 new jobs, more than 2,000 local construction jobs and literally a 4,000% increase in property taxes for what is currently an active quarry. Other IDAs around New York have approved similar incentives for similar fulfillment centers because they too want to create a billion-dollar economic impact for their communities and for the state.”</p><p>Regarding the monitor’s “violation notice” Orange County IDA CEO Bill Fioravanti said, “Mr. Sanvidge has sat through every IDA meeting about this application, right through the final approvals, and he has never raised even a minor concern about this project or our process at any point. Only under intense political pressure to chase away Amazon did the monitor consider a veto, yet to this point he still hasn’t cited any specific objections. Instead, this is just a technical argument about whether or not his veto window already closed, which is in dispute.”</p><p>Fioravanti concluded: “The IDA is committed to full transparency through this entire process and that will continue as we work through this disagreement.”</p><p>Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in reaction to the monitor’s ruling: “This decision from the IDA monitor is wrong procedurally and on the facts. We’re working with the Orange County IDA as we determine our next steps.”</p><p>The Amazon project is believed to be among the largest private industrial development investments and the largest in terms of scope in the history of Orange County. The facility, if developed, would be the second-largest Amazon fulfillment center in New York State, surpassing those in New York City.</p><p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This is a developing story.

    <description><![CDATA[New York’s housing ecosystem is at an inflection point. Affordability pressures, development bottlenecks, small-property owner challenges, regulatory changes, and aging housing stock are all converging at the same time.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the Mamdani Administration announced the full roster of individuals who will help guide the incoming mayor through the critical first phase of governing. More than 400 leaders from across New York City have been appointed to serve on 17 Transition Advisory Committees, each charged with digging into the most pressing issues facing the city and offering concrete recommendations that will shape early policy direction.</p><p>For the real estate industry and for all professionals whose work intersects with housing, development, and community well-being this moment presents both an opportunity and a responsibility. A new mayor brings new priorities, new voices, and new energy, but also new risks if our industry’s challenges are not clearly understood or accurately represented. </p><p>The transition committee structure is designed to bring together a broad cross-section of expertise: nonprofit executives, business leaders, academics, labor representatives, social service organizations, and community advocates. Their task is to assess existing conditions, surface gaps, and outline early strategies the administration may pursue once in office. Among these committees is a dedicated group focused on housing a space that directly affects every Realtor, property owner, renter, developer, and prospective homebuyer in our city.</p><p>New York’s housing ecosystem is at an inflection point. Affordability pressures, development bottlenecks, small-property owner challenges, regulatory changes, and aging housing stock are all converging at the same time. How the new administration interprets these challenges—and whose perspectives they hear will directly influence the city’s policy direction on zoning, construction, property rights, tenant protections, homeownership access, and more.</p><p>That is why it is essential for our members to stay informed and engaged throughout this transition process. The conversations unfolding right now will shape the narrative and priorities for years to come. Decisions about housing policy do not happen in isolation; they are influenced by the information committee members receive, the issues elevated to their attention, and the balance of viewpoints in the room.</p><p>Our association will continue to monitor developments closely, analyze committee discussions, and proactively share updates with you. But staying informed cannot be a passive exercise. This is a critical window for us to ensure that the realities facing our industry—ranging from inventory shortages to permitting delays, from co-op transparency to the cost of doing business—are part of the broader conversation taking shape.</p><p>Over the coming weeks, we encourage members to:</p><ul>
<li>Follow the administration’s announcements and committee activities.</li>
<li>Share emerging challenges you see in the field so we can elevate them effectively.</li>
<li>Stay active in advocacy alerts and policy briefings.</li>
<li>Engage in discussions around how the transition may impact your business and your clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transition is not just a governmental formality it is where priorities get defined. With more than 400 voices at the table, it is more important than ever that our industry remains present, informed, and ready to contribute.</p><p>As the Mamdani Administration charts its course, we remain committed to ensuring that the housing conversation is comprehensive, fact-based, and reflective of the communities and professionals who keep New York moving. This is our moment to help shape the future of housing in our city and we intend to meet it head-on.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[HGAR’s Orange County Day featured a Legislative Power Hour with County Executive Steve Neuhaus, who addressed a packed room with his trademark energy.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This fall, HGAR experienced a notable surge in civic engagement across Orange, Westchester and Putnam counties. Members were given multiple opportunities to connect directly with elected officials, ask meaningful questions, and engage in substantive dialogue about the issues shaping our communities. What emerged from these conversations was not only a clearer picture of local priorities but a reassuring sense of steady leadership during an otherwise turbulent political season.</p><h3 id="orange-county-energy-growth-and-opportunity">Orange County: Energy, Growth, and Opportunity</h3><p>HGAR’s Orange County Day featured a Legislative Power Hour with County Executive Steve Neuhaus, who addressed a packed room with his trademark energy. Coming just days before Election Day, the County Executive struck a confident and forward-looking tone, emphasizing what makes Orange County a place people want to live, work, and invest.</p><p>The conversation, led by HGAR Orange County Director Carole McCann, covered a broad range of topics, including how HGAR members can best highlight Orange County’s strengths to prospective clients and how the county and HGAR can continue to support one another at the local level.</p><p>County Executive Neuhaus highlighted several initiatives currently underway, including the county’s growing role as a hub for film and television production. He shared that major studios are actively developing lots and sets in Orange County, with productions already underway, including a film starring Angelina Jolie. Looking ahead, he also discussed plans for the adaptive reuse of the county’s rail assets, including the potential creation of a holiday-themed “Polar Express” train experience and also revealed that the county was within days of closing on the purchase of the Sugar Loaf Performing Arts Center.</p><h3 id="westchester-county-policy-housing-and-real-time-challenges">Westchester County: Policy, Housing, and Real-Time Challenges</h3><p>In Westchester, HGAR recently hosted a robust, dialogue-driven discussion with several members of the Westchester County Legislature, including Chairman Vedat Gashi; Majority Leader David Imamura, and Legislators Ben Boykin, Jewel Williams Johnson, Emiljan Ulaj, Judah Holstein, and Shanae Williams, who chairs the Housing Committee.</p><p>The conversation, which was moderated by HGAR Westchester County Regional Director Crystal Hawkins-Syska, was particularly timely, as the County Legislature is currently in budget negotiations. Despite their busy schedules, the Legislators gave HGAR their full attention and engaged directly on the issues most important to our members.</p><p>This “mini Lobby Day” included the distribution of HGAR policy papers addressing Good Cause Eviction, taxes on real estate transactions, incentives for for-sale housing development, and related housing concerns. Legislators acknowledged the likelihood of a tax increase this year and discussed potential mitigation strategies, including a Unit Improvement Program designed to help small landlords make necessary upgrades in the face of rent regulations.</p><p>While perspectives varied, there was broad agreement on one central point: Westchester needs more housing. The discussion underscored just how valuable these in-person conversations are, with both HGAR members and county leaders who left the room feeling heard and better informed.</p><h3 id="putnam-county-fiscal-responsibility-and-innovation">Putnam County: Fiscal Responsibility and Innovation</h3><p>Putnam County’s engagement took place via an intimate Zoom Legislative Power Hour with Putnam, County Executive Kevin Byrne. Led by HGAR Putnam County Director Carol Christianson, the conversation focused on what makes Putnam County attractive to future clients while highlighting the county’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.</p><p>County Executive Byrne spoke proudly of Putnam’s safety, natural beauty and strong infrastructure. He noted that the county has successfully reduced long-term debt while continuing to invest in critical services and infrastructure, including bridges, while emphasizing that Putnam currently has no “red-flag” bridges in urgent need of repair.</p><p>HGAR President Vlora Sejdi joined the conversation and asked how the county has managed to achieve such strong financial and infrastructure outcomes. County Executive Byrne credited high levels of municipal cooperation and the use of shared services, noting that collaboration has been key to Putnam’s success. He also highlighted the county’s Micro Transit system, an on-demand, affordable county-wide transportation service. The program has proven so successful that it is now being explored by other counties, including Orange.</p><h3 id="leadership-in-an-uncertain-time">Leadership in an Uncertain Time</h3><p>What stood out across all three counties was the steady, pragmatic approach taken by local leaders, even as national and state politics remain unsettled. HGAR met with one County Executive during a federal government shutdown, a County Legislature in the midst of budget negotiations, and another County Executive in the immediate aftermath of Election Day. Yet in each setting, there was a shared sense of “politics as usual,” focused squarely on governance rather than rhetoric.</p><p>County Executive Neuhaus, a Republican, spoke candidly about the potential impact of SNAP benefit reductions and the real families in Orange County who rely on those programs. Westchester Legislators addressed fiscal pressures without dwelling on federal uncertainty. County Executive Byrne, when asked about the recent New York City mayoral election, acknowledged that political trends often ripple outward from the city, while expressing confidence that Putnam would remain steady in the face of change.</p><h3 id="a-productive-path-forward">A Productive Path Forward</h3><p>Taken together, these conversations offered a compelling reminder of the value of local engagement. While headlines often emphasize dysfunction and division, HGAR’s recent experiences tell a different story—one of prepared, thoughtful leaders, addressing real challenges with realism and resolve.</p><p>For HGAR members, these events reinforced the importance of being present at the table, equipped with data, policy ideas and a willingness to listen. As we head into the next year, this season of civic engagement stands as a strong foundation for continued collaboration, informed advocacy and a shared commitment to the communities we serve.</p><p><em>About the author: Alexander Roithmayr is Director of Government Affairs for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Existing-home sales are projected to rise 1.7% in 2026 to 4.13 million, a small but notable gain after a nearly flat 2025 and one of the slowest sales periods in nearly 30 years.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, TX—Realtor.com released earlier today its 2026 Housing Forecast, which predicts a market steadying carefully, after several years defined by affordability strain, limited inventory, and a sharp slowdown in activity. Buyer conditions will improve gradually as mortgage rates ease, incomes rise, and more homes continue to come onto the market.</p><p>Still, the recovery is expected to be slow, with existing-home sales remaining well below normal and broader political dynamics and economic risks leaving the outlook somewhat fragile.</p><p>Realtor.com forecasts that the average 30-year mortgage rate will hold near 6.3% in 2026, down slightly from 2025's 6.6% average. That rate relief, paired with steady income growth, should help ease the affordability crunch and bring the typical mortgage payment share of income down to 29.3%—the first time since 2022 that this key measure drops below the 30% affordability threshold. Moreover, rent prices will continue their decline rounding out 2026 at -1%.</p><p>Home prices are expected to rise 2.2%, adding to the 2.0% gain seen in 2025. However, because inflation is projected to rise at a faster pace, real (inflation-adjusted) home prices will decline for the second consecutive year, offering additional breathing room for buyers even if nominal prices continue inching higher.</p><blockquote>“After a challenging period for buyers, sellers and renters, 2026 should offer a welcome, if modest, step toward a healthier housing market,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “Incomes are climbing faster than inflation as mortgage rates steady at a lower level create space for affordability to improve. Declining rental prices will continue to give renters more relief from pandemic highs. It's not a dramatic reset, but it's a meaningful shift that moves the market back toward balance.”</blockquote><p>For the New York metro region (New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Pa.), Realtor.com predicts home sales will fall 4.4%, while home prices in the region will grow by 5.2% in 2026.</p><h3 id="realtorcom-buyers-and-sellers-can-expect-in-2026">Realtor.com: Buyers and sellers can Expect in 2026</h3><ul>
<li>Average 30-year mortgage rates of 6.3%, after higher-than-expected interest rates in most of 2025, mortgage rates finally relaxed in the second half of the year. We expect mortgage rates to remain roughly in this range throughout 2026 as slowing economic growth and the end of the Fed's quantitative tightening offset rising U.S. government debt and inflationary pressure that's expected to be temporary.</li>
<li>Home prices will grow by 2.2%; however, real (inflation-adjusted) home prices will decline slightly for a second consecutive year.</li>
<li>Rents will drop slightly, by -1.0% nationally. Rents in the South and West could see larger declines.</li>
<li>An 8.9% increase in existing home inventory continuing the trend from the past two years.<br>
Single-family new home starts will grow by 3.1%, reaching 1.0 million homes, a slight increase from 2025 actuals.</li>
<li>Home sales will grow 1.7% year-over-year to 4.13 million.</li>
<li>Affordability improves modestly as the monthly payment to buy the typical home is expected to slip to 29.3% of median income, its first year under the 30% affordability threshold since 2022. This also marks the first decline in monthly payments on average across the year since 2020</li>
<li>Balanced Market: The national housing market will remain in balanced territory in 2026, averaging 4.6 months of supply across the year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inventory-recovery-extends-into-a-third-year">Inventory Recovery Extends into a Third Year</h3><p>The number of homes for sale will continue to expand in 2026, with active listings rising 8.9% year-over-year, marking the third consecutive year of inventory gains. The recovery is slowing as the market approaches more typical levels, but progress continues. By the end of 2026, for-sale inventory is expected to sit about 12% below pre-2020 norms, a significant improvement from the 19% gap in 2025 and the nearly 30% deficit seen in 2024.</p><p>With supply growing faster than sales, the national housing market will average 4.6 months of supply, keeping the market in balanced territory throughout 2026 even as it inches towards the 6-month supply threshold that marks the beginning of a buyer's market. Negotiating power is expected to tilt slightly toward buyers as more homes come online and affordability improves—though younger and first-time buyers will continue to face financial hurdles.</p><h3 id="home-prices-climb-but-not-in-real-terms">Home Prices Climb, but Not in Real Terms</h3><p>Home prices are expected to continue to climb in 2026, adding 2.2% for the typical home sold. These gains come on top of the 2.0% increase registered in 2025. However, inflation is expected to outpace these gains, with consumer prices likely growing more than 3%. That means real (inflation-adjusted) home prices will decline slightly for a second consecutive year.</p><h3 id="affordability-improves-modestly-but-meaningfully">Affordability Improves Modestly but Meaningfully</h3><p>Rising incomes, easing mortgage rates, and slower price growth are expected to deliver some of the first notable improvements in overall affordability since 2022. The typical monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is projected to fall 1.3% year-over-year, and the payment share of median income is expected to dip to 29.3%—below the 30% threshold for the first time in four years. Additionally, this marks the first decline in monthly payments on average across the year since 2020.</p><p>“The path back toward historic levels of affordability will be gradual, but 2026 takes a solid step in the right direction,” Hale said. “For many buyers who have spent years navigating limited options and steep competition, a balanced market with more choices and slightly lower cost burdens can be a game-changer, even if conditions remain far from easy.”</p><h3 id="softer-rents-in-the-south-and-west-especially">Softer Rents, in the South and West Especially</h3><p>Renters are also poised to see continued relief. Realtor.com expects rents to decline 1.0% nationally in 2026 as robust multifamily construction feeds new supply into the market. Vacancy rates are likely to approach or exceed the long-term average of 7.2% by year's end, further easing conditions.</p><p>The South and West will see the largest benefits from rent softening, driven by significant new construction and already-moderating prices. In high-density, high-cost metros such as New York City, however, rents will remain elevated and affordability will continue to pose challenges despite broader national relief.</p><h3 id="modest-improvement-in-home-sales-but-lock-in-effect-persists">Modest Improvement in Home Sales, but Lock-In Effect Persists</h3><p>Existing-home sales are projected to rise 1.7% in 2026 to 4.13 million, a small but notable gain after a nearly flat 2025 and one of the slowest sales periods in nearly 30 years. Even so, sales will remain historically low. High prices and elevated mortgage rates continue to weigh on demand, and the market is still grappling with an entrenched lock-in effect.</p><p>Recent data show that four out of five mortgage-holding homeowners have a rate below 6%, giving many little incentive to move unless life changes—such as a new job, family needs, or downsizing—force their hand. That trend is expected to continue into 2026, keeping turnover subdued even as conditions gradually improve.</p><h3 id="economic-and-policy-risks-persist">Economic and Policy Risks Persist</h3><p>While the base forecast calls for a modestly improving housing environment, several risks could shift the outlook:</p><ul>
<li>Policy uncertainty related to fiscal and trade measures could influence inflation dynamics and consumer sentiment.</li>
<li>Federal Reserve policy remains a major wildcard; tightening or easing too quickly could disrupt progress.</li>
<li>A softening labor market could slow consumer spending, weakening housing demand.</li>
<li>Inflation pressures—driven by tariffs, energy costs, or supply chain shifts — could impact both mortgage rates and household budgets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a recession is not the base case, the economy remains in a sensitive period of adjustment. A policy misstep or shift in consumer sentiment could create a temporary setback with implications for housing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[One of the key pieces of legislation discussed was Intro 1120, sponsored by Councilmember Julie Farías, that would establish clear timelines for cooperative boards to process, review, and issue decisions on co-op purchase applications.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been an exceptionally active and productive week for our Government Affairs Team as we continue working to ensure that the issues shaping our industry remain front and center in New York’s legislative and policy discussions. With major developments at both the federal and local levels, our team has been fully engaged in representing the interests of our members and the consumers we serve. </p><p>We began the week with a valuable meeting with Congressman Adriano Espaillat prior to his return to Washington. The discussion focused on the key housing and real estate priorities most pressing for New York City, including affordability challenges, access to homeownership, development bottlenecks. Congressman Espaillat remains a critical voice for our region in Washington, and we appreciate his continued openness to hearing directly from industry professionals who understand the practical implications of federal housing policies.</p><p>Later in the week, HGAR, NYSAR, and LIBOR had the opportunity to participate in a City Council hearing on a series of co-op transparency bills that have generated significant attention across the real estate community. Our presence at the hearing ensured that the interests of our members and the buyers and sellers they represent were firmly heard as the council evaluates potential changes to the cooperative purchase process.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/12/IMG_6697-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2131" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/IMG_6697-1.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/IMG_6697-1.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/IMG_6697-1.jpg 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/12/IMG_6697-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From left, HGAR’s Jermaine Meadows, Federal Political Coordinator Christina Stevens and Congressman Adriano Espaillat.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>One of the key pieces of legislation discussed was Intro 1120, sponsored by Councilmember Julie Farías, that would establish clear timelines for cooperative boards to process, review, and issue decisions on co-op purchase applications. As many of our members know firsthand, the lack of transparency and predictability in the co-op approval process has long been a challenge for buyers, sellers and agents alike. Intro 1120 addresses this issue directly by setting forth a reasonable and structured set of deadlines:</p><ul>
<li>Cooperative boards must acknowledge receipt of an application within 10 days, or the application is deemed complete.</li>
<li>Boards must issue a decision approval or denial within 45 days of receiving the completed application.</li>
<li>If additional time is needed, a 14-day extension may be granted, provided the board notifies the applicant.</li>
<li>Importantly, if a board fails to issue a decision within the 45-day timeline plus any applicable extension, the application would be deemed approved. This provision introduces accountability into a process that has often lacked it and would help ensure that buyers and sellers can move forward with confidence rather than face indefinite delays.</li>
</ul>
<p>We expressed our support for this legislation, emphasizing that transparency does not diminish a co-op board’s authority it simply ensures that decisions are made in a timely, fair and consistent manner.</p><p>We also voiced our support for Intro 407, which would require co-op corporations to provide prospective purchasers with a written explanation detailing the reasons for a rejection within five days of the decision. This measure represents another meaningful step toward fairness and accountability in the co-op marketplace. Standardized disclosures help eliminate ambiguity, reduce the potential for discriminatory decision-making, and give buyers and sellers clearer insight into the factors shaping outcomes.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/12/IMG_4898.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1285" height="726" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/IMG_4898.jpg 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/IMG_4898.jpg 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/12/IMG_4898.jpg 1285w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NYSAR, LIBOR and HGAR officials testify at City Council Hearing.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Together, these bills represent a thoughtful and balanced approach to modernizing the cooperative housing system. They preserve the autonomy of co-op boards while protecting consumers from practices that can create uncertainty and financial hardship.</p><p>Our Government Affairs team will continue monitoring both pieces of legislation closely and engaging with elected officials throughout the process. We remain committed to ensuring that any reforms strengthen transparency, promote equity and support a healthy and functioning housing market.</p><p>As always, thank you to our members for your continued engagement and for staying informed on these crucial issues. Your involvement makes our advocacy stronger, and together, we will continue to push for policies that serve both our industry and the communities we represent.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[In terms of anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Yun expects the Fed to cut rates later today (Dec. 10) and will initiate two further rate cuts in 2026.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—A group of real estate economists predict modest improvement in most key metrics in the coming year, including home sales, mortgage rates and home selling prices.</p><p>Led by National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s virtual Real Estate Forecast Summit held on Dec. 9 featured mostly positive predictions for the residential real estate markets in 2026.</p><p>Yun related that existing residential home sales were down 0.1% by the end of November 2025, ensuring that 2025 will be the third straight year of subpar sales volume performance. New home sales were down 1.2% by the end of November. NAR expects existing home sales to be flat in 2025 as compared to a year earlier, while new home sales are expected to decline by 2% by the end of this year. Yun expects for-sale inventory to rise once again in 2026.</p><p>Yun related that home sales are currently at 75% of the activity posted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also noted that in the five-year period from the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2025, home prices in New York State have risen a remarkable 59.4%.</p><p>In terms of anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Yun expects the Fed to cut rates later today (Dec. 10) and will initiate two further rate cuts in 2026. However, those rate cuts will have a minimal impact on mortgage lending rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported today that the average 30-year conventional mortgage rate for the week ended Dec. 5 was 6.33%. NAR expects the mortgage rate to end 2026 at 6.0%.</p><p>While there are some market headwinds, including the impending U.S. Supreme Court decision on the legality of tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration and poor consumer sentiment, Yun predicts home prices will rise 4% in 2026 after increasing 3% this year. Job gains will also tick up from approximately 400,000 in 2025 to 1.3 million in 2026. The unemployment rate, however, will rise from 4.3% in 2025 to 4.5% next year.</p><blockquote>“After three years of flat home sales, a solid double-digit percentage increase is expected in 2026,” Yun said. “In 2026, we expect higher inventory, modest improvements in affordability, and more accommodating monetary policy from the Federal Reserve will help more Americans buy their next home."</blockquote><p>Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale said that Realtors should expect the market to move in a “more buyer-friendly environment” in 2026.</p><p>Hale related, “We expect a more balanced housing market in 2026, leaning slightly in buyers' favor compared with 2025, as modest improvements in affordability, driven by mortgage rate relief and slower home price growth, give incomes a bit more room to catch up.”</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/12/nationwide-forcast.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/nationwide-forcast.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/nationwide-forcast.png 1000w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/nationwide-forcast.png 1600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2025/12/nationwide-forcast.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Robert Dietz, SVP &amp; Chief Economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said NAHB is cautiously optimistic about the home building market with single-family construction starts expected to rise 1% in 2026, multifamily building projected to be flat next year and home remodeling activity rising 4% in the next 12 months.</p><p>He said an expected small improvement in housing affordability conditions will bolster the supply side of the housing market.</p><p>Both Realtor.com and NAR released respective reports on the hot markets entering 2026. NAR released its top 10 markets, while Realtor.com amassed a list of 100 hot markets.

    <description><![CDATA[The Gaming Commission also approved a rule change that altered the term of the casino license depending on the amount of investment.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK—The New York State Gaming Commission unanimously approved the three applicants for full casino licenses—Bronx Bally’s in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx; the Hard Rock/Metropolitan Park proposal by Citi Field in Willets Point, Queens and the expansion of the Resorts World New York City gaming facility at Aqueduct Racetrack in Jamaica, Queens.</p><p>The Gaming Commission approved all three by a 7-0 vote. Each project must designate an independent monitor who will later be approved by the Gaming Commission. The respective monitors will report back to the Gaming Commission on a quarterly basis for at least the next five years.</p><p>The Gaming Commission Board Chairman Brian O’Dwyer noted in his remarks that the commission is contemplating hiring an engineering firm to also consult with the Gaming Commission Board on the progress of each casino project.</p><p>The Gaming Commission at the session held at the Robert Frederick Smith Center for the Performing Arts at the Denny Farrell Riverbank State Park in Harlem, also approved a rule change that altered the term of the casino license depending on the amount of investment.</p><p>It was this proposed rule change by Gaming Commission staff that prompted MGM Yonkers to withdraw its application on October 15 for a full casino license for its Empire City gaming property in Yonkers. The rule, adopted unanimously by the Board, the rule, which was published in the State Register on Oct. 8, establishes four tiers in terms of licensing term—10 years for investments up to $1.5 billion, 15 years for investments for up to $5 billion; 20 years for investments up to $10 billion and 30 years for investments of more than $10 billion.</p><p>At its Dec. 1st meeting at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan, the Gaming Facility Location Board approved by a 5-0 vote the proposals by Hard Rock /Metropolitan Park, Resorts World New York City and the Bally's Bronx project for approval by the full Gaming Commission. According to Gaming Commission estimates, the three projects total nearly $11 billion in new capital investment.</p><p>The Bally’s Bronx project is projected to involve a $2.3-billion investment; the Resorts World New York City development is expected to be a $3.3-billion project, while the Hard Rock Metropolitan Park proposal calls for $5.3 billion in investment if approved by the Gaming Commission.</p><blockquote>Gov. Kathy Hochul said of the Gaming Commission’s vote: “The three approved casinos will generate billions of dollars for the MTA and education, create tens of thousands of jobs and deliver real benefits to their surrounding communities. Each of the projects made significant commitments to their communities and to New York State, and the Gaming Commission was clear that they will hold these projects accountable and make sure they keep their promises. That is what New Yorkers expect and what they deserve.”</blockquote><p>Robert DeSalvio, President of Genting Americas East, in reaction to the Gaming Commission’s decision to grant Resorts World New York City a full commercial casino license, stated: “Resorts World New York City thanks the New York State Gaming Commission for today’s final approval. We look forward to opening within months as New York City’s first full commercial casino.”</p><p>The Bally’s Bronx facility is projected to open in mid 2030; Hard Rock Metropolitan Park by June 2030, while Resorts World New York City expects the converted facility to open in March 2026, with completion of the expansion in 2029 and full project completion in 2031.</p><p>In total, there were eight applicants for casino licensure. However, prior to MGM Yonkers Inc.’s withdrawal, the respective project Community Advisory Committees previously rejected the proposals of the Manhattan-based Freedom Plaza, the Avenir, Caesars Palace Times Square and The Coney in Brooklyn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New York’s DOS licensing rules treat marketing and communications as part of the regulated brokerage business. Telemarketing compliance therefore connects directly to broker supervision obligations.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Direct solicitation has always been a key revenue generation tool for real estate brokerages. However, it is critical for licensed brokers and salespersons to be aware that it is a heavily regulated consumer-protection activity. In New York, General Business Law (“GBL”) Section 399-z [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3KW2KyR">https://bit.ly/3KW2KyR</a>] governs telemarketing and do-not-call compliance and adds a heightened restriction during a declared State of Emergency or Disaster Emergency.</p><p>Additionally, federal regulations [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3Y04Ssq">https://bit.ly/3Y04Ssq</a>] administered by the Federal Trade Commission can also apply, particularly when calling programs involve interstate activity or vendors. Finally, because marketing and solicitation are part of the brokerage’s business, telemarketing compliance intersects directly with broker supervision and advertising-control requirements under New York Department of State regulations, including section 175.25 [<em>see</em> 19 NYCRR § 175.25 at <a href="https://bit.ly/4rZVzpY">https://bit.ly/4rZVzpY</a>].</p><h3 id="gbl-%C2%A7-399-z-what-new-york-regulates">GBL § 399-z: What New York Regulates</h3><p>GBL § 399-z is New York’s primary “Do Not Call” statute. It broadly targets telemarketing campaigns designed to induce a consumer to purchase or pay for goods or services. For real estate professionals, this can capture common scenarios, such as calling homeowners to solicit listings, calling consumers to market brokerage services, or running scripted calling campaigns through teams or vendors.</p><p><strong><em>‘Telemarketing’ and ‘Unsolicited Telemarketing Sales Calls’</em></strong></p><p>The statute’s definitions matter because many restrictions are triggered only when the contact is “unsolicited.” As a practical compliance rule, brokerages should assume a call is “unsolicited” unless it is clearly tied to (i) the consumer’s express request for contact (for example, an inbound lead), or (ii) a documented established business relationship that has not been terminated and has not been opted out of. If a brokerage relies on an “established business relationship” rationale, it should be prepared to prove such a relationship with customer relationship management entries, engagement dates and opt-out history.</p><p><strong><em>Time-of-Day Limits and Opening Disclosures</em></strong></p><p>New York restricts telemarketing calls to the hours of 8:00 a.m. through 9:00 p.m. local time at the consumer’s location, unless the consumer expressly agrees to be called at another time. The law also requires clear, beginning-of-call disclosures, which identify the caller and the entity on whose behalf the call is made, and which requires a meaningful pathway for the consumer to request to be placed on the caller’s internal do-not-call list.</p><p><strong><em>Internal Do-Not-Call List, Opt-outs and Records</em></strong></p><p>GBL § 399-z contemplates more than a one-time scrub against a registry. Brokerages should maintain an internal, entity-specific do-not-call list and honor opt-out requests consistently across the entire brokerage firm, all of its offices and all of its agents. The statute also imposes record-retention expectations (i.e., 24-month retention requirement) that, in practice, require brokerages to retain: (i) dialing lists or list sources; (ii) proof of registry scrubs; (iii) internal suppression lists; and (iv) opt-out logs. A compliance program that cannot produce records is often treated as no compliance program at all.</p><h3 id="the-%E2%80%98state-of-emergency%E2%80%99-restriction-gbl-%C2%A7-399-z">The ‘State of Emergency’ Restriction: GBL § 399-z</h3><p>GBL § 399-z contains a specific and frequently overlooked prohibition that is especially relevant to real estate prospecting. It is unlawful for a telemarketer doing business in New York to knowingly make an unsolicited telemarketing sales call to any person located in a county, city, town, or village that is under a declared State of Emergency or Disaster Emergency under Executive Law sections 24 or 28. The restrictions relating to cold calling also apply to statewide issued States of Emergency and Disaster Emergency declarations.</p><p>These emergency declarations can be broad, or can be narrow and specific (storm events, flooding, public safety events and other localized emergencies). Currently, there are statewide States of Emergency in effect and, therefore, cold-calling is currently prohibited. Nevertheless, it is imperative that before any cold calls are made by any licensed broker, salesperson, or any team members, they always check with their broker, legal counsel (whether in-house or outside counsel), and even with the New York State Association of Realtors.</p><p>Accordingly, a brokerage that uses purchased lists, neighborhood “FSBO/expired” datasets, predictive dialers, or distributed agent calling should implement an operational method to suppress calls in declared emergency locations. Some of the options or tools can include geo-fencing by ZIP/county, pausing specific campaigns and maintaining a dated log of when and how the office implemented the suppression. Further, brokerage firms, brokers and salespersons should also be wary of representations made by services or companies selling these lists that the consumer has approved or consented to being solicited. If any consumer on such lists files a complaint and has not opted in or provided consent, the burden would be on the broker to prove otherwise.</p><h3 id="division-of-consumer-protection-requirements-and-penalties-up-to-20000-per-violation">Division of Consumer Protection Requirements<br>And Penalties Up To $20,000 Per Violation</h3><p>GBL § 399-z is enforced through the DOS Division of Consumer Protection. Enforcement is often complaint-driven and can require rapid production of records showing the basis for the call, the office’s scrubbing practices, and its internal do-not-call list controls. The Division of Consumer Protection can also subpoena and obtain records from the FTC as well as other parties in connection with any enforcement action. It is important for brokers and agents to visit the DOS website to review all of the requirements and restrictions relating to cold-calling [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4pKdIqs">https://bit.ly/4pKdIqs</a>].</p><p>Any party found to be in violation, after notice and a hearing, will be subject to a civil penalty of up to $20,000 per violation. Each unlawful solicitation call will be treated as a separate violation, creating significant aggregate exposure. Robo-call services can make several hundred and even thousands of calls, and each call would be subject to a separate penalty of up to $20,000. Additionally, the Division of Licensing would also institute parallel suspension or revocation proceedings from a licensing standpoint.</p><h3 id="federal-requirements-the-ftc-telemarketing-sales-rule">Federal Requirements: The FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule</h3><p>Many brokerages also need to account for federal telemarketing rules. The FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”) [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/3XW9vnu">https://bit.ly/3XW9vnu</a>] regulates certain telemarketing campaigns that involve interstate activity and are designed to induce a purchase or payment for goods or services. Real estate businesses often become “interstate” by outsourcing calls to out-of-state inside sales teams, using national lead vendors or running multi-state campaigns through a centralized dialer.</p><p><strong><em>Transparency, Do-Not-Call Compliance, and Recordkeeping</em></strong></p><p>While the TSR contains detailed provisions, the operational themes most relevant to brokerages are: (i) truthful and non-deceptive sales practices; (ii) required disclosures during telemarketing calls; (iii) honoring Do-Not-Call and opt-out requests; and (iv) retaining required records. Brokerage firms that use third parties should require contractual compliance, including obligations to follow the TSR, maintain records and cooperate with any inquiry.</p><p>Even when a brokerage believes it is operating “locally,” vendors and technology can create interstate activity and broaden exposure. For risk management, brokers should treat telemarketing compliance as a vendor-management issue as much as an agent conduct issue, and should demand written compliance representations, documented scrubs, and audit rights from any platform or marketing provider engaged to generate calls or texts.</p><h3 id="broker-supervision-under-section-17525-why-this-is-not-%E2%80%98just-marketing%E2%80%99">Broker Supervision Under Section 175.25: Why This Is Not ‘Just Marketing’</h3><p>New York’s DOS licensing rules treat marketing and communications as part of the regulated brokerage business. Telemarketing compliance therefore connects directly to broker supervision obligations. If a broker encourages cold-calling, provides scripts, distributes lists, or adopts calling tools, the broker must supervise those activities as brokerage operations. Section 175.25 is framed as an advertising rule, but it reinforces a broader compliance principle. The broker is responsible for advertising and communications published or made under the brokerage’s name and must control the content and method of those communications.</p><p>From a failure-to-supervise perspective, a broker’s exposure increases when the brokerage lacks written procedures, does not train licensees, does not monitor cold-calling practices, and cannot demonstrate corrective action when violations occur. In a telemarketing investigation, the broker’s supervision file (for example, policies, training logs, audits, discipline and other records) can be as important as the call itself.</p><h3 id="recommended-practical-office-controls">Recommended Practical Office Controls</h3><p>A defensible cold-calling compliance program should be operational, documented, and easy to enforce. At a minimum, brokerages should:</p><ol>
<li>Ensure that periodic and frequent notices go out firm-wide, to all licensed salespersons, associate brokers, and managers that cold-calling is not permitted during a State of Emergency and specifically state the declared State(s) of Emergency.</li>
<li>Adopt a written telemarketing policy covering, but limited to, the following: permitted calling hours, required opening disclosures, National Do-Not-Call scrubbing, internal do-not-call lists, emergency-area prohibitions and record-retention requirements.</li>
<li>Centralize opt-outs in the CRM and suppress numbers office-wide immediately (not agent-by-agent).</li>
<li>Standardize scripts and prohibit “freelance” scripts that omit identification or opt-out language.</li>
<li>Create an emergency declaration monitoring and geo-fencing protocol (for example, who checks, how often, how campaigns are paused, and how it is documented).</li>
<li>Audit dialers, texting tools and lead vendors.</li>
<li>Require written compliance representations, record access, and cooperation obligations in any contracts with third-parties that provide lead generation lists, or cold-calling or robo-calling services.</li>
<li>Train all licensees at onboarding and periodically document attendance and materials; and implement a consistent corrective-action mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brokers and managers should supervise and maintain internal checklists, and a system of checks and balances. Brokers and managers must be sure to address any violations quickly and definitively. If there is a violation discovered, a broker must take swift action and, where necessary, terminate an agent’s affiliation with the brokerage firm immediately.</p><h3 id="violations-could-potentially-bankrupt-a-violator">Violations Could Potentially Bankrupt a Violator</h3><p>Cold-calling is not prohibited in New York. However, it is heavily conditioned and regulated. It is important to note that during declared emergencies, unsolicited calls are strictly prohibited, and are unlawful where legal requirements are not followed and adhered to. The penalties can be severe, up to $20,000 per violation. Violations can quickly add up when a robo-call service is utilized (making hundreds and even thousands of calls) resulting in potentially hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in fines. The best protection is a brokerage-level compliance program that controls lists and tools, trains licensees, supervises outreach under DOS standards and retains the records needed to prove it.</p><p><em>Legal Corner Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[This year’s accomplishments reflect HGAR’s continued commitment to advocacy, education and engagement.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2025 was a transformative year for HGAR’s advocacy efforts, strengthening our presence across New York City and delivering meaningful wins for our members and the real estate community. Our work this year reflects a deep commitment to protecting property rights, advancing transparency, and ensuring a robust, well-informed real estate market.</p><p>One of the most significant achievements was securing nearly $400,000 in Issues Mobilization Funds from state and national associations to support a major NYC ballot initiative—a historic accomplishment that demonstrates HGAR’s growing influence and leadership in local policy matters. Complementing this, our members contributed $164,110 in RPAC funds, further solidifying engagement in advocacy efforts crucial to protecting the future of our industry.</p><p>HGAR played a central role in a citywide campaign in support of Ballot Measure 3, partnering with Realtor associations across New York City to achieve a major advocacy victory. We also formalized a Realtor Coalition and hosted the NYC Realtor Rally, creating a structured platform for alignment and strategy across all five boroughs. These initiatives strengthened collaboration and ensured that our collective voice remains powerful and coordinated.</p><p>Education and dialogue were central to our mission this year. The Bronx Forum on Housing Vouchers &amp; the FARE Act brought together more than 90 members to explore critical housing issues, while the Informational Forum on Good Cause Eviction engaged more than 40 members in meaningful discussion on emerging policy trends. These forums, alongside our Annual Legislative Breakfast, fostered direct interaction between members, policymakers, and industry leaders, ensuring that HGAR remains both a thought leader and a bridge to legislative decision-makers.</p><p>On the legislative front, HGAR testified in strong support of Intro 1120, advancing much-needed transparency in the co-op purchase process—a continuation of advocacy initiated during 2024’s NYC Lobby Day. We also opposed Intro 902 (COPA), mobilizing members in a coordinated outreach effort to protect property rights. Looking ahead, we developed comprehensive 2026 legislative priorities for New York City and several counties, establishing a clear, forward-looking advocacy agenda.</p><p>To keep members informed, HGAR launched a weekly Government Affairs column in <em>Real Estate In-Depth</em>, publishing nearly 25 articles covering elections, policy updates, and industry-impacting developments. The Local Political Coordinator Program also debuted, training more than 25 participants to serve as local advocacy leaders. Across Westchester, Putnam, and Orange County, we hosted multiple Legislative Power Hours, effectively creating mini-Lobby Days that brought members closer to their elected officials and legislative issues.</p><p>This year’s accomplishments reflect HGAR’s continued commitment to advocacy, education and engagement. From policy victories to innovative member programs, 2025 has strengthened HGAR’s position as a trusted, influential voice in New York’s real estate community. As we move into 2026, we will continue to advance our mission, empower members and shape policies that protect and grow our industry.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales increased by 0.5% in November, according to the National Association of Realtors Existing-Home Sales Report released on Dec. 19.</p><p>Month-over-month sales increased in the Northeast and South, showed no change in the West, and fell in the Midwest. Year-over-year sales showed no change in the Northeast and South, and decreased in the Midwest and West.</p><blockquote>“Existing-home sales increased for the third straight month due to lower mortgage rates this autumn,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, inventory growth is beginning to stall. With distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months.”</blockquote><p>“Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand,” Yun added. “As has been the case throughout the year, single-family home sales outperformed condominium sales in November. The typical price of a sold condo was 13.5% lower than the typical price of a single-family home. However, the purchase price does not include the condominium association fees, which are rising and making these purchases more expensive.”</p><h3 id="national-snapshot">National Snapshot</h3><p><br><strong>Total Existing-Home Sales for November</strong></p><ul>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWBURGH—Newburgh City Manager Todd Venning announced on Dec. 19 the appointment of Mike Neppl as Deputy City Manager for the City of Newburgh, following confirmation by the City Council. Neppl served back in 2022 as Government Affairs Director for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors based in White Plains.</p><p>The Deputy City Manager was formally established through the city’s 2026 Budget process and corresponding local law, creating a new chartered executive role to support Newburgh’s expanded operational and development agenda, city officials stated.</p><p>“This appointment reflects the scale and momentum of what’s happening in Newburgh,” said Venning. “Mike has been instrumental as Chief of Staff, and his leadership, judgment, and operational discipline make him the right choice as we enter our next phase of growth.”</p><p>Newburgh is experiencing one of the most significant public–private investment periods in its history, with more than $500 million in development underway, including: the North Interceptor Sewer Separation &amp; Improvement Project, the new Delano-Hitch Aquatic Center, the African American Burial Ground Reinterment Project, bridge and roadway replacement projects at Lake Street, Lake Drive, and Walsh Road and citywide water, stormwater and sewer system upgrades.</p><p>The city is also embarking on a host of housing and neighborhood revitalization initiatives, including a luxury boutique downtown hotel, more than 800 units of new residential housing citywide and nearly 700,000 square feet of new commercial and industrial construction citywide.</p><p>The city is also moving forward with the revitalization of Newburgh Landing, which will reactivate one of the only deep-water ports between New York City and Albany, capable of serving industrial, commercial, recreational, and passenger uses.</p><p>“Together, these public and private investments represent a comprehensive development strategy that will generate jobs, increase foot traffic for local businesses, expand commercial activity, enhance neighborhood quality, and create new opportunity across the entire city,” City Manager Venning added. “With institutional leadership to match our scale of investment, we are delivering the future of the Queen City of the Hudson.”</p><p>Newburgh Mayor Torrance Harvey said, “I’ve served through multiple stages of Newburgh’s growth, and each stage has required the City to do more — to coordinate better, lead more decisively, and hold itself to a higher standard of accountability. I’ve made it a priority to meet that responsibility head-on, which is why I strongly support strengthening our executive structure through the Deputy City Manager role.”</p><p>As Deputy City Manager, Neppl, who takes on the position after serving as Chief of Staff, will act as a key operational leader working alongside the City Manager to oversee strategic operations, align departments, advance major initiatives, and implement long-term priorities in infrastructure, public safety, housing, and government modernization.</p><blockquote>“I am humbled and honored to step into this role and serve my hometown at such a pivotal time,” Neppl said. “Newburgh is generating remarkable momentum, and I look forward to supporting the City Manager and the Council as we deliver the projects and services that reflect the needs and aspirations of our community.”</blockquote><p>Mr. Neppl will be sworn in at a public ceremony on Monday, Jan.12, 2026.</p><p>Neppl is a fifth-generation Newburgh native, attorney, and a 25-year veteran of New York State government and politics. As Chief of Staff, Mr. Neppl directly supports the City Manager in the administration of daily operations for the city’s departments and program implementation for the city’s $100-million annual budget. Neppl serves as chief press officer and manages the city's strategic partnerships, with additional responsibilities as chair of the Newburgh Industrial Development Agency.</p><p>He began his career as Assistant Counsel to the Governor, where he managed a broad portfolio that included housing, health, economic development, and criminal justice issues affecting all New Yorkers. Mike left the Governor’s Office to join the New York State Senate’s counsel and policy team prior to serving as Research Director for back-to-back successful Attorney General campaigns. Neppl then joined the New York State Office of the Attorney General, where he served as Assistant Attorney General. After transitioning out of state government, Mike became a nonprofit executive with the New York Library Association, where he served as General Counsel and Director of Government Relations for advocacy campaigns that secured more than $800 million for public library services statewide. Immediately prior to joining the City of Newburgh, he served as Government Affairs Director for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors from April 2022 to August 2022.</p><p>Neppl attended Newburgh schools before graduating from SUNY Albany and Albany Law School.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE—The New York real estate market remained strong and accelerated in November. Home values rose, and buyer interest increased. The regional median sales price jumped 6.5% year-over-year to $685,000, showing high demand in the New York Metropolitan area, according to data released recently by OneKey MLS.</p><p>Closed sales fell 7.5% year-over-year due to seasonality, but the market stayed strong. Pending sales rose across all housing categories: single-family homes up 4.0%, condominiums up 6.0%, and co-ops up 11.6%.</p><p>This contract activity mirrors national patterns, underscoring that buyers are responding quickly to steady mortgage rates and favorable fall conditions.</p><blockquote>Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS, said, “Pending sales, especially the 5% jump across all property types, show buyers gaining confidence. Consumers are moving quickly, setting up an active start to 2026.”</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the single-family homes segment continues to drive the market, with median sales reaching $750,000—a 7.1% increase from November 2024. As inventory remains limited, down more than 7% year-over-year for all property types, competition for move-in-ready homes continues to boost equity gains for current homeowners.</p><p>Looking ahead, expect this competitive environment to persist into early 2026, as buyers remain eager despite limited options, OneKey MLS stated in its report. Many prospective buyers are expanding their searches to surrounding counties and suburban markets in hopes of finding suitable homes. This increase in activity is likely to support continued price growth and keep market momentum strong as the new year begins, sustaining the region's positive trends.</p><h3 id="hgar-market-area-snapshot-november-2025">HGAR Market Area Snapshot-November 2025<br></h3><p><em><strong>Note: </strong>All November 2025 data is in comparison to activity 12 months prior.</em></p><p><strong>NYC Metro Region</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $750,000, up 7.1%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 2,777, down 6.2%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $525,000, up 3.4%<br>Condo Sales: 504, up 0.6%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $299,000, up 1.4%<br>Co-Op Sales: 426, down 17.3%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 9,848, down 8.1%</p><p><em>Note: The New York City Metro Region covers: Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Sullivan, and Dutchess counties in the Hudson Valley, Nassau and Suffolk counties and the boroughs of the Bronx and Queens.</em></p><h3 id="hgar-market-area">HGAR Market Area</h3><p><br><strong>Bronx County</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $720,000, up 9.3%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 41, down 4.7%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $277,500, down 14.6%<br>Condo Sales: 12, down 20.0%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $227,500, down 1.1%<br>Co-Op Sales: 38, down 19.1%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 236, up 15.1%</p><p><strong>Orange County</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $480,000, up 2.1%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 190, down 1.6%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $310,000, up 7.3%<br>Condo Sales, 37, up 5.7%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 857, down 0.6%</p><p><strong>Putnam County</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $555,000, up 1.0%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 64, up 23.1%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $399,000, up 26.7%<br>Condo Sales: 9, down 30.8%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 169, down 4.0%</p><p><strong>Rockland County</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $789,000, up 4.5%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 139, down 1.4%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $420,000, down 4.5%<br>Condo Sales: 44, up 25.7%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $130,000, down 19.4%<br>Co-Op Sales: 5, down 16.7%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 413, up 16.7%</p><p><strong>Sullivan County</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $339,000, down 7.1%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 61, down 3.2%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $435,000<br>Condo Sales: 1<br>Single-Family Inventory: 532, up 13.4%</p><p><strong>Westchester County</strong></p><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $899,500, up 0.4%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 310, up 4.4%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $520,500<br>Condo Sales: 94, up 6.8%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $206,000, down 9.0%<br>Co-Op Sales: 111, up 1.8%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 670, down 9.8%</p><p><em>SOURCE: ONEKEY MLS</em></p><p>To access all local and regional housing market reports, visit <a href="https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/">https://marketstats.onekeymls.com</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in November jumped by 3.3% from the prior month and 2.6% year over year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report released today (Dec. 29).</p><p>Month-over-month and year-over-year pending home sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.</p><p>November’s Realtors Confidence Index survey showed that 22% of NAR members expect an increase in buyer traffic over the next three months, up from 17% in October and down from 24% one year ago. Meanwhile, 18% expect an increase in seller traffic, up from 16% last month and down from 22% in November 2024.</p><blockquote>“Homebuyer momentum is building. The data shows the strongest performance of the year after accounting for seasonal factors, and the best performance in nearly three years, dating back to February 2023,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Improving housing affordability—driven by lower mortgage rates and wage growth rising faster than home prices—is helping buyers test the market. More inventory choices compared to last year are also attracting more buyers to the market.”</blockquote><h3 id="november-2025-national-pending-home-sales">November 2025 National Pending Home Sales</h3><p>3.3% increase month over month<br>2.6% increase year over year</p><h3 id="november-2025-regional-pending-home-sales">November 2025 Regional Pending Home Sales</h3><p><br><strong>Northeast</strong></p><p>1.8% increase month over month<br>1.8% increase year over year</p><p><strong>Midwest</strong></p><p>1.3% increase month over month<br>2.2% increase year over year</p><p><strong>South</strong></p><p>2.4% increase month over month<br>3.3% increase year over year</p><p><strong>West</strong></p><p>9.2% increase month over month<br>2.4% increase year over year</p><p>The percent of change in pending home sales is based on the Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI)*— a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on home-contract signings.

The Northeast posted an index of 68.4 in November.</p><p>*The Pending Home Sales Index is a leading indicator for the housing sector, based on pending sales of existing homes. A sale is listed as pending when the contract has been signed, but the transaction has not closed, though the sale usually is finalized within one or two months of signing.</p><p>Pending contracts are good early indicators of upcoming sales closings. However, the amount of time between pending contracts and completed sales is not identical for all home sales. Variations in the length of the process from pending contract to closed sale can be caused by issues such as buyer difficulties with obtaining mortgage financing, home inspection problems, or appraisal issues.</p><p>The index is based on a sample that covers about 40% of multiple listing service data each month. In developing the model for the index, it was demonstrated that the level of monthly sales-contract activity parallels the level of closed existing-home sales in the following two months.</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2026/01/2025-11-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-29-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/2025-11-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-29-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2026/01/2025-11-pending-home-sales-housing-snapshot-infographic-12-29-2025-1000w-1500h-2.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[New Yorkers deserve a state where they can raise a family, keep the lights on, and stay rooted in the communities they love.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY—New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in her State of the State address on Tuesday promised policies that will enhance affordability in housing, health care, child care, insurance and utility costs in the state, while protecting residents from harmful policies of the Trump administration.</p><blockquote>“New Yorkers deserve a state where they can raise a family, keep the lights on, and stay rooted in the communities they love,” Gov. Hochul said. “That is why I am committed to lowering the costs that hit working families the hardest—child care, energy, housing, transportation and groceries. Together we will ensure that our government works for working people and expands opportunities for all New Yorkers.”</blockquote><p>Among her signature proposals include partnering with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani to fund the launch of the new mayor’s 2-Care program (for two-year-olds) and realizing the promise of universal 3K (three-year-olds) access in New York City. Among her child care initiatives include making Pre-K universal child care statewide by making funding available to provide high-quality pre-k seats for all four-year-olds in the state by the start of the 2028-29 school year.</p><p>While her address touched on some housing initiatives, including a thorough review of the state’s environmental review process and a commitment to speed up housing, infrastructure and clean energy project approvals, her State of the State presentation provided much more detail.</p><p>Among some of her key housing/infrastructure-related proposals include:</p><ul>
<li>$250 million to accelerate affordable housing development, speeding up the construction of thousands more affordable homes and transformative projects and another $100 million to incentivize manufactured housing.</li>
<li>A five-year, $3.75 billion commitment to water infrastructure, with $750 million in funding per year, which will continue to support and grow signature water programs;</li>
<li>The launch of a new Smart Growth Water Grant Program, which will focus on sewer and water projects that directly enable the construction of new housing units and the creation of permanent jobs;</li>
<li>Modernizing the Jamaica Station in Queens into a world-class station. The reimagined Jamaica Station will help create better traffic flow, reduce crowding, and build out a world-class station complex providing seamless connection between the LIRR Main Line, NYC Transit, and AirTrain JFK for the millions of commuters who depend on this station.</li>
<li>Advance the expansion of Second Avenue Subway project. Gov. Hochul is proposing to support the next phase of this project with funding for design and preliminary engineering to advance tunneling across 125th Street. The extension along 125th Street will improve commutes for millions of New Yorkers, save significant time for commuters benefiting from intersections with seven north-south subway lines across Manhattan, and connect underserved communities to jobs. She also continued her commitment to the Interborough Express project in Queens.</li>
<li>Raising her previous goal of attracting 1 gigawatt of new nuclear power to 5 gigawatts of new nuclear power in upstate New York. The Nuclear Reliability Backbone will be developed by a new Department of Public Service process to consider, review, and facilitate a cost-effective pathway to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy that will combine with existing nuclear generation and the New York Power Authority's previously announced 1 gigawatt project, to create an 8.4 gigawatt “backbone” of reliable energy for New Yorkers.</li>
<li>She vowed to have new data centers pay their fair share of the large utility costs those projects generate and eventually require these projects to provide their own power and not to tap into the state’s grid.</li>
</ul>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we begin the first Government Affairs update of the year, affordability has clearly emerged as the defining policy theme at both the state and city levels setting the tone for what will be a consequential year for New York’s real estate and housing industry.</p><p><strong>Governor’s 2026 State of the State:<br>Housing and Cost of Living Front and Center</strong></p><p>Tuesday, Governor Kathy Hochul delivered her 2026 State of the State address, outlining an agenda heavily focused on affordability, housing supply, and economic stability for New Yorkers. The governor emphasized the continued strain rising costs place on households and positioned housing production, regulatory reform and tenant protections as central tools to address those pressures.</p><p>Among the key takeaways for the real estate industry were renewed calls to streamline development processes, reduce delays that increase construction costs, and encourage housing production across income levels. The governor also reiterated support for policies aimed at protecting tenants while balancing the need to incentivize responsible development and long-term investment.</p><p>The full 2026 State of the State address and supporting materials can be reviewed here:<br><a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/programs/2026-state-state">https://www.governor.ny.gov/programs/2026-state-state</a></p><p>As details emerge through the budget and legislative process, the governor’s proposals will require close monitoring, particularly where regulatory changes and affordability mandates intersect with development feasibility and financing.</p><h3 id="new-york-city-leadership-and-the-affordability-agenda">New York City Leadership and the Affordability Agenda</h3><p>At the city level, the newly inaugurated mayor has made affordability the cornerstone of his administration’s early messaging. Housing access, cost burden, and tenant protections have been framed as urgent priorities, with the administration signaling a willingness to pursue bold policy interventions in response to rising rents and limited housing supply.</p><p>For the real estate industry, this signals a continuation and potential expansion of policies that directly impact ownership, development and transactions. While affordability goals are broadly shared, the mechanisms used to achieve them will be critical. Regulatory certainty, clear rules, and coordination between city and state government will play a major role in shaping market outcomes.</p><h3 id="legal-developments-signal-early-constraints">Legal Developments Signal Early Constraints</h3><p>Importantly, an early legal development this week underscores the limits and challenges facing aggressive housing interventions. A federal judge delivered an initial legal setback to one of the mayor’s housing-related efforts, reinforcing that policy ambition must still operate within established legal and constitutional boundaries.</p><p>The ruling, covered here, serves as a reminder that litigation risk will remain a factor as new housing policies are tested:<br><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/federal-judge-delivers-mamdani-early-legal-setback-housing-market-intervention">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/federal-judge-delivers-mamdani-early-legal-setback-housing-market-intervention</a></p><p>For industry stakeholders, this moment highlights the importance of engagement, advocacy and clarity as new proposals move from rhetoric to implementation.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-the-industry">What This Means for the Industry?</h3><p>Taken together, the governor’s State of the State address and the city’s affordability agenda make one thing clear: housing policy will dominate the 2026 legislative and regulatory landscape. For owners, developers, brokers, and housing professionals, staying informed and engaged will be essential as affordability goals, regulatory reform and legal realities continue to evolve.</p><p>Government Affairs will continue to track these developments closely and provide updates as proposals advance through Albany and City Hall.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Year-over-year sales increased in the South, remained flat in the Midwest and West, and decreased in the Northeast.</p><blockquote>“2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth. December home sales, after adjusting for seasonal factors, were the strongest in nearly three years. The gains were broad-based, with all four major regions improving from the prior month.”</blockquote><p>“Inventory levels remain tight,” Yun added. “With fewer sellers feeling eager to move, homeowners are taking their time deciding when to list or delist their homes.

    <description><![CDATA[Another major federal development affecting real estate professionals was the postponement of FinCEN’s Residential Real Estate Reporting Rule. Originally scheduled to take effect in 2025, the rule was delayed until March 1, 2026.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we close the books on 2025, the real estate industry finds itself navigating one of the most transformative periods in recent memory. Real estate brokers, property managers, attorneys and housing professionals faced sweeping changes at the local, state and federal levels, impacting everything from marketing practices and pricing tools to privacy rights, antitrust exposure and federal and state reporting obligations. This article highlights the most consequential legal developments of 2025, identifies key legislation enacted and proposed during the year, and looks ahead to the issues that will shape the real estate industry in 2026.</p><h3 id="i-regulatory-compliance-and-professional-practice-developments">I. Regulatory Compliance and Professional Practice Developments</h3><p>One of the most significant compliance reminders in 2025 involved restrictions on cold-calling and telemarketing. New York General Business Law Section 399-z [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/399-Z">NY GBL §399‑z</a>] prohibits unsolicited telemarketing calls during a declared State of Emergency. Violations can carry civil penalties of up to $20,000 per call. These state restrictions operate in parallel with the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-310">FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule</a>], which imposes strict requirements related to disclosures, recordkeeping, calling hours, and internal do-not-call procedures.</p><p>These obligations are directly tied to broker supervision requirements under 19 NYCRR Section 175.25 [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/19-NYCRR-175.25">Section 19 NYCRR Section 175.25</a>]. Brokers are responsible not only for their own conduct, but also for the actions of affiliated licensees and third-party marketing vendors. In 2025, this convergence of telemarketing law and licensing supervision underscores the need for written policies, vendor audits, training programs and documentation demonstrating active broker oversight.</p><h3 id="ii-federal-anti-money-laundering-reporting-and-fincen-developments">II. Federal Anti-Money Laundering Reporting and FinCEN Developments</h3><p>Another major federal development affecting real estate professionals was the postponement of FinCEN’s Residential Real Estate Reporting Rule. Originally scheduled to take effect in 2025, the rule was delayed until March 1, 2026. Once implemented, it will require reporting of beneficial ownership information for certain non-financed residential real estate transactions involving legal entities [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/rre">FinCEN Residential Real Estate Rule</a>].</p><p>While the delay provided temporary relief, it also served as a warning. Brokers, attorneys, and settlement professionals must use the additional time to identify covered transactions, determine reporting responsibilities, update engagement agreements and implement internal compliance procedures. The continued use of Geographic Targeting Orders throughout 2025 [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-renews-residential-real-estate-geographic-targeting-orders">FinCEN Renews Residential Real Estate Geographic Targeting Orders</a>] further emphasized the federal government’s focus on transparency and anti-money laundering enforcement in real estate transactions.</p><h3 id="iii-new-york%E2%80%99s-ban-on-algorithmic-rent-setting-tools">III. New York’s Ban on Algorithmic Rent-Setting Tools</h3><p>In 2025, New York enacted one of the most consequential antitrust measures impacting the rental housing market by amending the Donnelly Act [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/340">NY Donnelly Act (GBL Article 22)</a>] to prohibit the use of certain algorithmic rent-setting tools. Effective Dec. 15, 2025, the law makes it unlawful for landlords, property managers and software providers to use programs that collect and analyze rental data from multiple owners to recommend pricing or lease terms.</p><p>The statute treats these tools as facilitating unlawful coordination among competitors, exposing users and vendors to potential antitrust liability, including treble damages. For real estate professionals, the law necessitated immediate review of property management agreements, technology vendors and pricing practices. It also highlighted a broader trend toward increased scrutiny of artificial intelligence and data-driven tools in housing markets.</p><h3 id="iv-privacy-and-consumer-protection-trends">IV. Privacy and Consumer Protection Trends</h3><p>Privacy protection also gained momentum in 2025 with the passage of the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act. The legislation reflects a growing emphasis on safeguarding personal data collected during real estate transactions. Mortgage applications, digital signatures, MLS platforms, and transaction management systems increasingly fall under heightened privacy expectations. [<em><u>See</u></em> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2808">Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act</a>]. For brokers, this trend reinforces the need to review data retention policies, cybersecurity practices and third-party service provider agreements to ensure compliance with evolving privacy standards.</p><h3 id="v-antitrust-licensing-and-practice-standards">V. Antitrust, Licensing, and Practice Standards</h3><p>Throughout 2025, courts and regulators continued to shape the legal landscape governing real estate competition and professional conduct. Antitrust litigation and regulatory actions reinforced that traditional practices can carry significant legal risk if they limit competition or transparency.</p><p>At the same time, New York regulators emphasized compliance with licensing rules, including proper use of corporate titles, accurate website disclosures and adherence to supervision obligations. Environmental and property-condition laws also remained a focus, including expanded attention to lead paint registries and disclosure obligations affecting residential properties.</p><h3 id="vi-new-york-state-lead-paint-rental-registry-law-new-compliance-requirements">VI. New York State Lead Paint Rental Registry Law: New Compliance Requirements</h3><p>In 2025, New York State implemented a statewide Lead Paint Rental Registry pursuant to New York State Public Health Law § 1377 [<em><u>See</u></em> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/1377">NY Public Health Law § 1377</a>]. The law expands lead hazard regulation beyond traditional disclosure requirements by mandating registration, inspection, and certification of certain older rental properties with the New York State Department of Health [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/lead/lead_rental_registry/property_owners.htm">NYSDOH Lead Rental Registry</a>].</p><p>The registry applies to residential rental buildings with two or more units built before 1980 that are located in designated “Communities of Concern.” Property owners must register eligible buildings and arrange for lead hazard inspections conducted by qualified professionals. Units must be certified as lead-safe, meaning that no lead hazards exist or that any identified hazards have been properly remediated.</p><p>The registry became operational on Nov. 3, 2025. Inspection and certification requirements are being phased in during 2026, with enforcement timelines varying by locality. In New York City, Local Law 31[<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/lead-based-paint.page">NYC Local Law 31 (Lead Paint)</a>] already requires EPA-certified inspections for many pre-1960 and pre-1978 buildings, creating overlapping compliance obligations.</p><p>This new registry represents a shift from reactive lead paint disclosure to proactive hazard prevention. Due diligence in sales and leasing transactions must now account for registry status, inspection documentation and coordination with federal and local lead paint laws.</p><h3 id="vii-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-and-its-impact-on-real-estate">VII. The One Big Beautiful Bill and its Impact on Real Estate</h3><p>One of the most widely discussed federal measures in 2025 was the One Big Beautiful Bill Act [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">OBBB Act</a>]. Although not exclusively a housing bill, the legislation bundled tax, infrastructure and economic development provisions with meaningful implications for the real estate industry.</p><p>The Act expanded and extended federal incentives designed to stimulate development and redevelopment, particularly in supply-constrained markets. Infrastructure funding for transportation, utilities and resiliency projects effectively enhanced development potential and property values by improving site viability and long-term investment stability.</p><p>From a capital markets perspective, the legislation signaled a federal commitment to economic growth and development, supporting investor confidence and long-term planning. While the Act did not impose direct affordability mandates, its focus on increasing housing supply reflected a market-driven approach that contrasts with local and state efforts centered on price controls and transactional restrictions.</p><p>For brokers, developers and owners, the legislation underscored the importance of understanding how federal incentives interact with state and local regulatory frameworks. The growing tension between federal pro-development policy and local regulatory intervention will continue to influence deal structure, underwriting and site selection in 2026.</p><h3 id="viii-new-york-state-corporate-and-llc-transparency-act">VIII. New York State Corporate and LLC Transparency Act</h3><p>Effective Jan. 1, 2026, New York State implemented its own Corporate and LLC Transparency Act [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S995B">NY Corporate &amp; LLC Transparency Act</a>], requiring most domestic and foreign corporations and limited liability companies authorized to do business in the state to disclose beneficial ownership information to the New York Department of State. Modeled in part on the federal Corporate Transparency Act [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://bit.ly/42GQVCy">FinCEN Residential Real Estate Reporting Rule</a>], the New York law expands transparency requirements at the state level and directly impacts many real estate holding entities.</p><p>Covered entities must disclose identifying information for beneficial owners, including individuals who exercise substantial control or own at least a 25% interest. Exemptions are limited and largely mirror federal exemptions for heavily regulated entities. Importantly, the New York statute applies even where federal filings have already been made, requiring separate state-level compliance.</p><p>Many properties are held in single-purpose LLCs, investment entities or family-owned companies that may now be subject to disclosure. Failure to comply can result in civil penalties and potential restrictions on the entity’s ability to conduct business in New York. This new transparency requirement reinforces a broader trend toward ownership disclosure and regulatory oversight in real estate transactions. Brokers and advisors should encourage clients to review entity structures, confirm filing obligations, and coordinate compliance with both federal FinCEN reporting and New York State requirements.</p><h3 id="ix-new-york-city%E2%80%99s-copa-act-and-local-legislative-developments">IX. New York City’s COPA Act and Local Legislative Developments</h3><p>At the local level, one of the most significant housing policy debates in 2025 centered on New York City’s Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA). The legislation would have required owners of certain multifamily properties to provide qualified nonprofit organizations with a right of first offer or refusal before selling their buildings [<em><u>see</u></em> <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6695280&GUID=17713221-6B17-4AE9-9892-AF107A836713&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=902&ref=realestateindepth.com">NYC Community Opportunity to Purchase Act</a>].</p><p>Mayor Adams vetoed COPA, citing concerns that it would deter investment, complicate transactions, and impose unfunded administrative burdens. Although vetoed, COPA remains politically relevant, as the City Council may revisit the issue or attempt a veto override.</p><h3 id="x-looking-ahead-to-2026">X. Looking Ahead to 2026</h3><p>As 2026 begins, real estate professionals face a complex regulatory environment. The upcoming March 1, 2026, FinCEN reporting deadline requires immediate attention. New York’s ban on algorithmic rent-setting tools is already in effect, with enforcement and litigation likely to continue shaping its application.</p><p>At the same time, federal housing supply initiatives, state tenant-protection proposals and local affordability measures will continue to evolve. Success in this environment requires proactive compliance, careful monitoring of legislative developments and strategic planning that accounts for overlapping and sometimes conflicting policy goals.</p><p>The legal developments of 2025 reshaped the real estate industry in lasting ways. From enhanced compliance obligations and antitrust scrutiny to evolving privacy standards and ambitious housing policy proposals, the year underscored the importance of legal awareness and operational readiness. As the industry moves into 2026, informed and adaptable professionals will be best positioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p><p><em>Legal Corner Column author John Dolgetta, Esq. is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Single-family homes led the market with 3,229 closed sales, reflecting a 1.4% increase over the previous year.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY—The OneKey MLS December 2025 Market Report highlights a regional housing market that closed the year with measured growth, resilient demand, and continued price stability across the region’s diverse housing segments.</p><p>Across the OneKey MLS service area, total closed sales increased 1.5% year-over-year, reaching 4,303 transactions, with gains across single-family homes, condominiums, and co-ops. Median sales prices continued their upward trajectory, rising 3.8% year-over-year to $675,000, reflecting sustained buyer confidence amid constrained inventory.</p><p>Single-family homes led the market with 3,229 closed sales, reflecting a 1.4% increase over the previous year. The median sales price for single-family homes rose to $740,000, up 4.2% from December 2024. Condominiums saw a median price increase of approximately 9.0%, while co-ops rose by 8.9%. Pending sales for all property types increased by 12.8%, indicating positive momentum entering early 2026.</p><p>Inventory remained tight, with total homes for sale down 9.0% year-over-year, helping to keep days on market relatively low. Properties sold in a median of 54 days, nearly 7% faster than one year ago, while sellers continued to receive close to the asking price, averaging 98.6% of the original list price.</p><p>“December’s data shows a market that continues to move forward with discipline and durability,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “Even with ongoing inventory challenges, buyers and sellers remained engaged through year-end, and the strength we’re seeing in pending sales and pricing points to a constructive start for 2026. These trends reflect the adaptability of our professionals and the enduring appeal of our region.”</p><blockquote>“While the chill of December swept through the Hudson Valley, our real estate market kept some spark. Across the HGAR region, we're seeing subtle signs of stabilization that give us reason to feel cautiously optimistic,” said 2026 HGAR President Rey Hollingsworth Falu. He noted that Westchester posted a 7.5% jump in median sale price while Orange, Putnam and Rockland counties “played it cool. Interest rates are creeping down and politicians are talking about housing. This market is evolving, not evaporating.”</blockquote><p>He added: “Buyers are adjusting to rates with creative financing, and inventory, though still tight, is finding movement as sellers begin to recalibrate expectations. We’re not just surviving winter; we’re warming up for what we believe could be a more active spring. At HGAR, we’re preparing our members for this next chapter with new tools, smarter advocacy, and more strategic data. Whether it’s the Bronx’s double-digit bump in median price or Rockland’s growing appeal, we’re seeing opportunity in every corner of our territory. If 2025 was the year of recalibration, 2026 is shaping up to be the year of reactivation. We’re tied to success, and that tie is getting stronger.”</p><p>Looking ahead, market activity is expected to remain steady as demand continues to outpace available inventory. With buyer engagement holding firm and pricing trends showing resilience, the region enters 2026 on a solid footing, OneKey MLS officials stated.</p><h2 id="hgar-market-area-snapshot-december-2025">HGAR Market Area Snapshot-December 2025</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong> All December 2025 data is in comparison to activity 12 months prior.</p><h3 id="nyc-metro-region">NYC Metro Region</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $735,000, up 4.9%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 3,418, up 2.1%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $549,345, up 8.8%<br>Condo Sales: 588, up 2.1%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $310,000, up 10.7%<br>Co-Op Sales: 519, up 1.0%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 8,207, down 10.5%</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The New York City Metro Region covers: Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Sullivan, and Dutchess counties in the Hudson Valley, Nassau and Suffolk counties and the boroughs of the Bronx and Queens.</p><h2 id="hgar-market-area">HGAR Market Area<br></h2><h3 id="bronx-county">Bronx County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $650,000, down 6.5%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 44, up 10%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $320,000, up 10.7%<br>Condo Sales: 13, flat as compared to December 2025<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $303,750, up 25.3%<br>Co-Op Sales: 44, up 10.0%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 212, up 9.3%</p><h3 id="orange-county">Orange County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $465,000, down 2.1%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 241, down 1.6%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $317,000, down 0.9%<br>Condo Sales: 35, up 9.4%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price; $80,500, down 42.9%<br>Co-Op Sales: 1, down 50%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 747, up 1.8%</p><h3 id="putnam-county">Putnam County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $548,750, down 1.9%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 102, up 50%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $431,000, up 12.8%<br>Condo Sales: 18, up 80%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price; $210,000<br>Co-Op Sales: 1<br>Single-Family Inventory:125, down 12%</p><h3 id="rockland-county">Rockland County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $725,000, up 1.0%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 164, up 11.6%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $470,000, up 13.3%<br>Condo Sales: 45, down 28.6%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $122,450, down 12.5%<br>Co-Op Sales:6, down 14.3%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 362, up 27.0%</p><h3 id="sullivan-county">Sullivan County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $372,000, up 9.0%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 80, up 1.3%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $325,000<br>Condo Sales: 1<br>Single-Family Inventory: 422, up 2.9%</p><h3 id="westchester-county">Westchester County</h3><p>Single-Family Median Home Sale Price: $980,000, up 7.5%<br>Single-Family Home Sales: 428, up 13.2%<br>Condo Median Sale Price: $540,000, up 11.9%<br>Condo Sales: 101, down 1.0%<br>Co-Op Median Sale Price: $242,500, up 7.8%<br>Co-Op Sales: 148, down 1.3%<br>Single-Family Inventory: 477, down 12.2%</p><p><em>SOURCE: ONEKEY MLS</em></p><p>To access all local and regional housing market reports, visit <a href="https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/">https://marketstats.onekeymls.com</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Pending home sales in December decreased by 9.3% from the prior month and 3.0% year over year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report released on Jan. 21.</p><p>Month-over-month pending home sales declined in all four regions. Year-over-year pending home sales rose in the South and declined in the Northeast, Midwest and West.</p><p>“The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “After several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.”</p><p>“Even after accounting for typical seasonal patterns, interpreting in-person home search activity in the winter—especially in December—can be tricky due to public holidays, people taking time off, and wintry weather conditions,” Yun added. “We’ll be watching the data in the coming months to determine whether the soft contract signings were a one-month aberration or the start of an underlying trend.”</p><p>“Data shows closing activity increased in December. However, new listings did not keep pace so inventory decreased. Consumers prefer seeing abundant inventory before making the major decision of purchasing a home. So, the decline in pending home sales could be a result of dampened consumer enthusiasm about buying a home when there are so few options listed for sale. In December there were only 1.18 million homes on the market—matching the lowest inventory level of 2025.”</p><h2 id="december-2025-national-pending-home-sales">December 2025 National Pending Home Sales</h2><ul>

    <description><![CDATA[Could the region see these exorbitant prices decline? The report states perhaps.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEWBURGH—Hudson Valley Pattern's Center for Housing Solutions released its 2025 Annual Housing Market Report on Jan. 26 that identified divergent trends for home prices and the total inventory of homes available on the market.</p><p>The median price of homes continued to rise in all nine counties from 2024-2025, pushing homeownership further out of reach for most residents. At the same time, more homes were available on the market as listings, sales, and the year-end inventory of available homes all increased.</p><p>The Hudson Valley hit another noteworthy milestone in 2025: the median cost of a home was $350,000 or greater in every county for the first time ever. All counties, except Greene and Sullivan, now have a median price over $450,000, and Rockland County’s median home price eclipsed $700,000 for the first time. Proportionally, the region’s most rural counties (Columbia, Greene, and Sullivan) continued to experience the greatest price inflation as their year-over-year median prices all increased by 8% or more.</p><p>Could the region see these exorbitant prices decline? The report states perhaps. The inventory of homes for sale on the regional market has increased. Approximately 1,350 more homes sold in 2025 compared to the previous year. The year ended with a 6% increase in homes available on the market. Thousands of homes, most of them apartments, are being constructed across the region. Still, these numbers will require steady analysis as the housing market does not always follow traditional supply-and-demand economics, the report stated.</p><p>Many forces are pulling on the regional housing market. Remote work is likely exerting upward pressure on rural home prices. A greater number of retirees are likely putting their homes on the market. Some households have likely moved back to the New York City metro area after seeking refuge in our region during the pandemic.</p><p>Some highlights from the 2025 Annual Housing Market Report include:</p><ul>
<li>The number of closed sales in the region rebounded modestly in 2025 after three consecutive years of decline.</li>
<li>New listings increased for the second year in a row after several years of decline. This might offer a glimmer of hope for first-time buyers who have struggled in a market where inventory was relatively low and demand was high.</li>
<li>The inventory of homes for sale in the Hudson Valley is still extremely depressed from its pre-pandemic baseline. The inventory of homes available to buy has shrunk by more than half. However, the modest increases of the past two years might signal a shift in the market that will eventually help buyers in the years ahead.</li>
<li>The total inventory of homes for sale across the Hudson Valley in the fourth quarter of 2025 remained relatively flat. The most significant swings were seen in Rockland (24% increase) and Westchester (10% decrease).</li>
</ul>
<p>Later this year, Pattern will publish a study to show the effects of corporate buyers and short-term rentals in our housing market. These research efforts are connective tissue that will help explain why the modern housing market in the Hudson Valley has created both more equity for homeowners and less opportunity for prospective homebuyers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[“Our data shows the market is adjusting rather than declining,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE, NY—OneKey MLS released its annual housing market report on Jan. 28, which detailed a number of residential real estate trends across the New York Metropolitan Area. The analysis noted that inventory shortages are driving up prices in some areas, while other locales are enjoying steadier growth, and buyer activity is returning to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>In 2025, pending sales rose 0.7% to 50,541, and closed sales dipped 0.6% to 48,833. Median home prices increased 5.9% year over year to $675,000, though at a slower pace than in past years. Inventory dropped 8.2% to 12,794 active listings, highlighting ongoing supply constraints.</p><h3 id="local-performance-varied-notably-by-region">Local Performance Varied Notably by Region</h3><p>New York City showed pronounced contrasts. Manhattan faced challenging conditions, with closed sales falling sharply—down 77.7% year-over-year—and inventory swelling to a 22.3-month supply, signaling sluggish demand and prolonged negotiations.</p><p>Conversely, the Bronx outperformed with a 12.3% increase in median sales price to $410,000, while Brooklyn and Queens maintained steady buyer interest despite listings spending longer on the market.</p><p>Long Island stood out for its stability amid broader volatility. Nassau County’s 9,799 closed sales were virtually unchanged compared to last year, as median prices climbed 5.9% to $805,000. Suffolk County’s sales edged down just 0.4%, but sellers there still averaged more than 100% of the original list price, contrasting with softer conditions in nearby Manhattan and indicating Long Island’s persistent demand for appropriately priced homes.</p><p>The Hudson Valley presented yet another picture. Putnam County’s closed sales jumped 15.6%, and Ulster County rose 8.3%. Median prices grew 7.6% in Putnam and 7.3% in Rockland County, highlighting continued strong buyer demand for comparatively affordable communities, in contrast to weak sales growth in parts of Manhattan.</p><blockquote>“Our data shows the market is adjusting rather than declining,” said Richard Haggerty, CEO of OneKey MLS. “While Manhattan recalibrates, parts of Long Island and the Hudson Valley display strength, revealing that local markets are progressing at different rates but gradually moving toward balance.”</blockquote><p>Sellers across the region performed well in 2025, averaging 99.2% of the original list price. Single-family homes received 99.6%, condominiums 98.3%, and co-ops 97.4% of their original list price. Transactions for homes priced at $849,000 or more increased 11.4%.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, OneKey MLS anticipates a gradual improvement in the New York metropolitan area. Mortgage rates fell in the second half of 2025 and are expected to remain near 6%, supporting some gains in affordability. Inventory growth will likely continue unevenly by county, with moderate price appreciation expected.</p><p>Explore the full report and get more detailed market insights at <a href="https://marketstats.onekeymls.com/">https://marketstats.onekeymls.com</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[The City Council passed legislation requiring most residential apartment buildings to provide air conditioning by June 1, 2030. ]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two recent developments at City Hall highlight the ongoing tension between housing affordability goals and policies that risk disrupting the real estate marketplace. As these debates continue, HGAR remains firmly committed to protecting property rights, promoting housing production and ensuring workable solutions for both consumers and Realtors.</p><h3 id="affordable-housing-bill-fails-to-advance-in-city-council">Affordable Housing Bill Fails to Advance in City Council</h3><p>This week, efforts to revive the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA) stalled after New York City Council leadership declined to advance an override vote of former Mayor Eric Adams’ veto. The bill, strongly supported by Mayor Zohran Mamdani and a group of Council members, failed to secure the 34 votes needed to override the veto and is not moving forward at this time.</p><p>COPA would have granted certain nonprofit organizations and designated entities a right of first refusal when multifamily properties are put up for sale, significantly interfering with private real estate transactions. While supporters frame the proposal as a preservation tool, HGAR strongly opposes COPA due to its far-reaching negative consequences for housing supply, property owners and the real estate marketplace.</p><p>COPA would:</p><ul>
<li>Insert government-backed entities into private sales, delaying transactions and increasing uncertainty.</li>
<li>Discourage investment in multifamily housing, particularly in communities that need new capital and rehabilitation.</li>
<li>Reduce property values by limiting seller options and market competition.</li>
<li>Ultimately slow housing production, worsening the very affordability crisis it seeks to address.</li>
</ul>
<p>HGAR has consistently maintained that policies that restrict the free transfer of property and create additional bureaucratic barriers will reduce housing availability, not expand it. The failure of the override is a positive outcome for Realtors, property owners and consumers who rely on a transparent, efficient housing market.</p><p>Supporters have signaled interest in reintroducing a revised version of COPA later this year. HGAR will remain actively engaged and opposed to any version of the bill that undermines property rights or disrupts market-driven housing solutions.</p><h3 id="city-council-passes-mandatory-air-conditioning-requirement">City Council Passes Mandatory Air Conditioning Requirement</h3><p>In a separate action, the City Council passed legislation requiring most residential apartment buildings to provide air conditioning by June 1, 2030. The bill became law after former Mayor Adams neither signed nor vetoed it within the statutory period.</p><p>Under the new law, landlords will be required to install and maintain cooling systems capable of keeping indoor temperatures at or below 78 degrees during the cooling season, defined as June 15 through Sept. 15. The extended implementation timeline is intended to give building owners time to address electrical capacity, infrastructure upgrades and financial planning.</p><p>Proponents argue the mandate responds to increasing heat-related health risks, particularly as extreme heat events become more frequent. However, many property owners and housing providers have raised concerns about:</p><ul>
<li>Significant upfront capital costs;</li>
<li>Electrical and building system limitations, especially in older housing stock and</li>
<li>Long-term operational and maintenance expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) will oversee enforcement once the law takes effect, with complaints handled through 311. The legislation includes provisions for hardship exemptions, though details on implementation and enforcement are still forthcoming.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-realtors">What This Means for Realtors</h3><p>These actions underscore the direction of housing policy in New York City that is increasingly focused on regulation rather than production.</p><p>Realtors should be prepared to:</p><ul>
<li>Advise clients on evolving compliance requirements.</li>
<li>Monitor future legislative proposals impacting property transactions.</li>
<li>Engage in advocacy efforts to promote policies that expand housing supply and protect property rights</li>
</ul>
<p>HGAR will continue to strongly oppose harmful legislation like COPA, while advocating for practical, market-based solutions that increase housing opportunities across New York City.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW ROCHELLE—Approximately 280 colleagues, guests, friends and family gathered at the Glen Island Harbour Club here to celebrate the installation of veteran Realtor Rey Hollingsworth Falu of Hollingsworth Real Estate Group of White Plains as the 2026 President of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</p><p>Hollingsworth’s installation was officiated by 2026 NYSAR President Ron Garafalo, who served as the 2019 HGAR President and is affiliated with John J. Lease Realtors in Middletown.</p><p>The gala program held on Jan. 29 also included the installation of HGAR’s 2026 Executive Officers and Directors by Previous Past President Carmen Bauman.</p><p>One of the highlights of the evening was the announcements by Immediate Past President Vlora Sejdi, Recognition Committee Chairperson Maryann Tercasio and Sponsor JoAnne Murray of Allan Block Insurance Agency of the top 2025 Award winners, which included Carole McCann being named Realtor of the Year and Alex Montalenti of Real Grader securing the Affiliate of the Year honor.</p><p>A somber point of the festivities was when HGAR officials and 2026 President Hollingsworth Falu paid tribute to HGAR Interim CEO Marty Nash, who passed away suddenly earlier this month. Hollingsworth noted that Nash, who only served in his position at HGAR for a short time, certainly “made his mark on New York.”</p><p>Hollingsworth Falu shared that his platform for 2026 is simply “Tied to Success.” He noted that HGAR was founded 110 years ago and has since grown to an association of 13,000 members representing Realtors from The Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, and Orange counties and Manhattan.</p><blockquote>“Tied to Success simply means we intend to tie every decision, every effort and every initiative to the success of every member of this association,” he told the crowd assembled at Glen Island Harbour Club. “Because everything we do—from advocacy to education to networking—must connect directly to helping you grow your business, serve your community and build a better future for the Hudson Valley and beyond.”<br><br>He added that the 2026 platform is “simple and powerful” and has three overarching goals: Member Value, Advocacy and Growth.<br><br>“We’re going to re-imagine the new member experience, strengthen our partnerships with brokers and managers, and diversify how we communicate to you,” Hollingsworth Falu said. “This year’s events will blend education and connection to close more deals.’</blockquote><p>Other components of the installation program included HGAR Chief Marketing Officer Liz Pollack opening the program, followed by remarks by Premier Sponsor Richard Haggerty of OneKey MLS; proclamations bestowed on the incoming HGAR President from Westchester County and the City of Mount Vernon and an invocation by Dr. Darren M. Morton.</p><p>Hollingsworth’s son Hunter Hollingsworth offered stirring renditions of the National and Black Anthems and also sang Michael Bolton’s “Go the Distance” just prior to his father’s installation.</p><p>For the full list of 2026 HGAR Officers and Directors and Award Winners, see below.</p><h3 id="2026-hgar-executive-officers">2026 HGAR Executive Officers</h3><p><br><strong>President</strong><br>Rey Hollingsworth Falu<br>Hollingworth Real Estate Group</p><p><strong>President Elect</strong><br>Anthony Ruperto<br>Ally Realty</p><p><strong>Treasurer</strong><br>Joseph Lippolis<br>BHHS River Towns owns Real Estate</p><p><strong>Secretary</strong><br>Shanese Williams<br>Real Broker NY LLC</p><p><strong>Immediate Past President</strong><br>Vlora Sejdi<br>HomeSmart Homes &amp; Estates</p><p><strong>2026 Regional Directors</strong></p><p><strong>Regional Director and Chapter Representative Bronx</strong><br>Mackenzie Forsberg<br>Genesis Realty Group Inc.<br><br><strong>Regional Director New York County (Manhattan) &amp; Chapter Representative Manhattan</strong><br>Tony D'Anzica<br>Dynamax Realty NYC Inc.<br><br><strong>Regional Director Orange</strong><br>Carole McCann<br>Hudson Heritage Realty<br><br><strong>Regional Director Putnam</strong><br>Myriam Ramos<br>Keller Williams Realty Partners<br><br><strong>Regional Director Rockland</strong><br>Soleil Jackman<br>Howard Hanna | Rand Realty<br><br><strong>Regional Director Westchester</strong><br>Crystal Hawkins Syska<br>Keller Williams NY Realty</p><p><strong>Directors</strong></p><p><strong>Previous Past President</strong><br>Carmen Bauman<br>Keller Williams NY Realty<br><br><strong>Director</strong><br>Layla Rose Boyles<br>Century 21 Realty Center<br><br><strong>Director</strong><br>Ernest Chi<br>Ernest Chi Real Estate LLC<br><br><strong>Director</strong><br>J.

    <description><![CDATA[As an industry, we must remain engaged in these discussions to ensure policies balance fiscal responsibility with a healthy and competitive real estate market.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city is facing a projected $12-billion budget gap over the next two fiscal years. This shortfall, described by New York City Comptroller Mark Levine as “beyond anything we’ve seen in recent memory,” reflects structural fiscal pressures, rising expenditures and limits in revenue growth. For our industry, which contributes a significant portion of the city’s tax base, these developments have direct implications for operations, investment decisions and long-term planning.</p><p>The projected deficit is not just a number, it signals potential pressure on municipal services that underpin the real estate market. Staffing for permitting, inspections, and code enforcement could face constraints. Investments in infrastructure and community development may be delayed. Programs that support affordable housing and tenant protections could see funding reductions. These changes could affect both residential and commercial real estate activity across the city, influencing project timelines, costs and market stability.</p><p>New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has acknowledged the size of the gap and proposed a combination of revenue adjustments and spending priorities to address it. While some proposals focus on higher-income taxes or development fees, these measures could influence market behavior and development incentives. As an industry, we must remain engaged in these discussions to ensure policies balance fiscal responsibility with a healthy and competitive real estate market.</p><p>The Comptroller’s office warns that this budget gap is unlikely to be fully addressed through one-time measures alone. This makes real estate’s role as a stable revenue source even more critical. Property and transaction taxes account for nearly half of NYC’s revenues, meaning any slowdown in market activity could further stress the city’s finances. It is essential for our members to monitor policy decisions that impact taxation, zoning, development approvals and city programs that affect property values and transactions.</p><p>Beyond immediate fiscal concerns, this is also a moment to consider equity and long-term market health. Policies around affordable housing, community development, and housing access are at risk when budgets tighten. Our industry must advocate for solutions that preserve economic opportunity, support sustainable growth and maintain New York City as a competitive real estate market.</p><p>Over the coming months, our association will be actively monitoring budget negotiations and engaging with city leaders to ensure that the voice of our members is heard. We will provide updates, analysis and guidance on how proposals may affect your business, investments and the broader market. Your engagement and awareness are critical. Together we can help shape policies that support a strong, stable and equitable real estate industry in New York City.</p><p>Our commitment remains clear: we will work with city officials to address these fiscal challenges while protecting the interests of our members, ensuring that New York City’s real estate market continues to thrive, and advocating for policies that balance financial sustainability with growth and opportunity.</p><p><em>About the author: Dr. Jermaine Meadows is the Director of Government Affairs for the Bronx and Manhattan for the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Home sales squeaked out a gain in the final quarter of 2025, helped by improving affordability conditions.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Home prices rose in 73% of metro markets (168 out of 230) during the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors latest quarterly report released today. That was down from 77% in the third quarter.</p><p>Five percent of metro areas (12 out of 230) recorded double-digit price gains, up slightly from 4% last quarter. The national median single-family existing-home price grew 1.2% year over year to $414,900, down from 1.7% annual growth in the third quarter.</p><p>“Home sales squeaked out a gain in the final quarter of 2025, helped by improving affordability conditions,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Mortgage rates fell, income growth outpaced home price growth, and the income required to buy a typical home declined.”</p><p>Yun added, “While most metro markets continue to see record-high housing wealth, some areas are experiencing home price declines. These declining markets are concentrated primarily in Florida and Texas, where robust supply and recent home construction are increasing competition among sellers to attract buyers.”</p><h3 id="median-existing-single-family-home-price-by-region-year-over-year-change">Median Existing Single-Family Home Price<br>By Region (Year-Over-Year Change)</h3><p><br><strong>Northeast: $514,600</strong> (+5.5%)<br>Midwest: $317,100 (+4.3%)<br>South: $367,300 (+0.2%)<br>West: $625,800 (-1.2%)</p><h3 id="10-large-markets-with-the-biggest-year-over-year-median-price-increases">10 Large Markets with the Biggest<br>Year-Over-Year Median Price Increases</h3><p><br>Mobile, AL (+13.7%)<br>Canton-Massillon, OH (+9.8%)<br><strong>Nassau County-Suffolk County, NY (+9.6%)</strong><br>Montgomery, AL (+9.4%)<br>St. Louis, MO-IL.

This report ranks the area’s 13 counties that experienced the greatest year-over-year percentage increase in home sales.</p><p>Putnam County, home to Carmel and Southeast, came out on top with a 15.6% increase in home sales from 2024. The area continues to experience an extremely tight home market with only 1.7 months of inventory.</p><p>Ulster and Rockland counties complete the top three with an 8.3% and 7.5% increase, respectively.

Overall, the market remains desirable, with many properties receiving multiple offers and selling above asking price.”</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[Due to low supply, the median home price reached a new high for the month of January.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales decreased by 8.4% in January, according to the National Association of Realtors Existing-Home Sales report released earlier today. Month-over-month and year-over-year sales fell in all regions.</p><blockquote>“The decrease in sales is disappointing. The below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation this January make it harder than usual to assess the underlying driver of the decrease and determine if this month’s numbers are an aberration,” said NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun. “Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR’s Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it’s been since March 2022. This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Due to low supply, the median home price reached a new high for the month of January,” Yun added. “Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth.”</blockquote><p>Affordability improved for the seventh consecutive month, according to NAR’s Housing Affordability Index—increasing to 116.5 in January from 111.6 in December and 102 a year ago.</p><h2 id="national-snapshot">National Snapshot</h2><h3 id="total-existing-home-sales-for-january"><br>Total Existing-Home Sales for January</h3><ul>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHITE PLAINS—The Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors released the area’s January 2026 year-over-year housing statistics on Thursday, Feb. 12, with sales prices rising in the region, fueled in part by continued tight inventory levels.</p><p>Westchester County closed January in a tight housing market. The month showed the median price for a single-family home is up 3.4% year-over-year to $915,000. There are only 1.8 months of inventory, down from 2.1 months in January 2025, while active listings are down 10% and closed sales are down 15%. The days on market remain low at 29, and 100% of the properties selling for the asking price or higher.</p><p>The Bronx is experiencing a more balanced housing market with 6.7 months of inventory. Single-family median home prices increased 4.5% year-over-year to $671,500. Active listings went up 7.3%, while closed sales rose slightly by 1%. Homes spent 54 days on the market in this area, and 98.4% sold for their original price.</p><p>The median sale price for Bronx condos rose 8% to $375K and by 9% to $262K for co-ops. Months of supply for condos and co-ops also increased 16% and 10%, respectively. New condo listings increased to 36, a 63% jump, while there were 100 new co-op listings, an increase of 6.4% in January 2026 compared to last year.</p><blockquote>“Overall, the region remains in high demand, with all areas continuing to experience exceptional competition for homes,” 2026 HGAR President Rey Hollingsworth Falu said. “While markets across the country are experiencing a softening housing market, we continue to have a need for more homes to meet growing demands.”</blockquote><p>Putnam County housing statistics indicate that homeowners are listing their homes more slowly than last year, with active listings down 8.6%. The data underscores the county's popularity, with only 1.7 months of inventory compared to 2.2 months in 2025 and closed sales up 32%. The median single-family home price went up 0.4% to $575,000.</p><p>Rockland County’s tight housing market has remained flat year-over-year with 2.5 months of inventory, and active listings up 8.4%. Homes were on the market 34 days, with 99% of the properties selling for the original price. Closed sales went down 0.6%, and the median price for a single-family home rose 0.9% to $750,000.</p><p>Orange County is a tight, yet more balanced housing market than the surrounding counties, with 3.1 months of inventory. Active listings declined by 5.7%, and closed sales declined by 2.2%. Homes stayed on the market for 47 days, and 98.8% sold for their original price, while the median single-family home increased by 3.2% to $490,000.</p><p>“Due to the tight housing market, buyers should be prepared to act quickly and be prepared to offer at or above current asking prices,” HGAR’s Falu said. “A Realtor can help buyers make strategic decisions during what can be a very emotional transaction process.”</p><h3 id="january-2026-year-over-year-median-priceall-property-types-single-family-condo-and-co-op">January 2026 Year-Over-Year Median Price - All Property Types (Single-Family, Condo and Co-op)</h3><p>• Westchester County: $692,500, down 1.1%<br>• Orange County: $450,000, up 8%<br>• The Bronx: $419,500, down 4.7%<br>• Putnam County: $575,000, up 7%<br>• Rockland County: $670,000, down 2.9%</p><p>NOTE: Link to ALL regional reports:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hgar.com/news-stats/market-stats" rel="noreferrer">Market Data | Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS®</a>&nbsp;Scroll down to 2026 Market Stats</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[It is recommended that all real estate brokerage firms, including commercial brokerages, enter into detailed agreements with their buyer/tenant or seller/landlord clients.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real estate commission disputes are among the most common and costly forms of real estate litigation in New York. They are also among the most preventable. The <em>Capin &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Herskovitz </em>(1st Dept., 2021) [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/4rhSdhD">https://bit.ly/4rhSdhD</a>] case underscores a central reality that when the engagement terms are undocumented or vague, and a transaction later closes through another path, a broker’s commission claim will be difficult to establish.</p><h3 id="capin-case-in-a-nutshell-broken-causal-chain-defeats-a-commission-claim">Capin Case in a Nutshell:<br>Broken Causal Chain Defeats a Commission Claim</h3><p>In Capin, the plaintiff broker sought compensation in connection with a multi‑building sale. There was no explicit written brokerage agreement. After the broker’s involvement ended, and after being informed that the properties were “no longer for sale,” another brokerage firm contacted the buyer, handled negotiations and due diligence and closed the deal. The court found that Capin was not the “procuring cause” of the transaction and affirmed dismissal of its implied contract claim.</p><p>Capin is a reminder that courts will not award a commission simply because a broker invested time or helped “open the door” and introduced a buyer to a seller. Absent clear exclusivity, the broker must prove a direct and causal connection to the consummated transaction.</p><h3 id="the-basic-new-york-rules-an-agreement-%E2%80%9Cready-willing-and-able%E2%80%9D-and-procuring-cause">The Basic New York Rules:<br>An Agreement, “Ready, Willing and Able,” and Procuring Cause</h3><p>Commission entitlement in New York commonly revolves around three principles. First, there must be an enforceable basis for compensation. Ideally, a written contract is the best basis for entitlement to a commission on a real estate transaction. However, in certain circumstances when the facts show a meeting of the minds, an implied arrangement may establish a sufficient basis to support a commission claim in real estate transactions. Second, unless the broker holds an exclusive right, customarily through a written agreement, making causation irrelevant, the broker must establish it was the “procuring cause” of the completed transaction. Third, many decisions reiterate the traditional rule that a broker earns a commission when it produces a buyer who is “ready, willing and able” to purchase on the seller’s terms.</p><p>“Ready, willing and able” generally means the buyer is prepared to proceed on the seller’s terms and has the ability to do so, and many times can be established easily. “Procuring cause” is usually one of the more difficult elements to establish when there is no written agreement. Courts in the First Department have held that brokers must show a “direct and proximate link” between its efforts and the closing. Any breaks in the chain of causation (for example, time, intervening brokers, pauses in negotiations or independent re‑engagement) can defeat the claim.</p><p>These standards are rooted in long-standing New York commission jurisprudence. The 1881 case of <em>Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co</em>. is frequently cited for the proposition that a broker is not entitled to compensation unless the broker is the “efficient procuring cause” of the bargain, and that a principal may, in good faith, terminate the broker’s agency before a deal is made. More recently, <em>SPRE Realty, Ltd. v. Dienst</em> (1st Dept., 2014) [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4bOMxGV">https://bit.ly/4bOMxGV</a>] reaffirmed that the inquiry focuses on whether the broker’s efforts bear a direct and proximate link to the ultimate transaction, not whether the broker was merely involved at an earlier stage.</p><h3 id="statute-of-frauds-gol-%C2%A7-5-701-and-why-a-written-agreement-still-matters">Statute of Frauds GOL § 5-701 and<br>Why a Written Agreement Still Matters</h3><p>General Obligations Law (“GOL”) § 5‑701 [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4ky3qYC">https://bit.ly/4ky3qYC</a>] (commonly referred to as the Statute of Frauds) generally requires that most agreements be in writing (with certain exceptions). One such exception is detailed in GOL, § 5‑701(a)(10) which provides that the writing requirement “…shall not apply to a contract to pay compensation to an auctioneer, an attorney at law, or a duly licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman.” The Capin case shows why this exception is not a guaranty of a successful commission claim. Even if an implied claim is legally available, the absence of a written agreement creates ambiguities about the scope, exclusivity, commission payment triggers, what happens if the client uses another broker, as well as other issues, and these ambiguities will undoubtedly create litigation risks when there is no written agreement.</p><h3 id="licensing-a-threshold-requirement-rpl-%C2%A7-442-d">Licensing: A Threshold Requirement (RPL § 442-d)</h3><p>Real Property Law § 442‑d [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4rNxKRk">https://bit.ly/4rNxKRk</a>] bars recovery of any real estate brokerage compensation if the claimant is not a duly licensed broker, associate broker or salesperson. In practice, a commission case can fail quickly if Section 442‑d is not satisfied, regardless of whether procuring cause is established or if a ready, willing and able purchaser was introduced to the seller.</p><p>According to Section 442-d, “No person, co-partnership, limited liability company or corporation shall bring or maintain an action in any court of this state for the recovery of compensation… without alleging and proving that such person was a duly licensed real estate broker or real estate salesperson on the date when the alleged cause of action arose.”</p><h3 id="recent-decisions-causation-and-contracts-are-strictly-enforced">Recent Decisions: Causation and Contracts are Strictly Enforced</h3><p>Other recent New York decisions continue to reinforce the same themes that drove the outcome in the Capin, such as clear contract mechanics and a provable causal relationship. In <em>Macklowe Inv. Props. LLC v. MIP 57th Dev. Acquisition LLC </em>(1st Dept., 2025) [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/4rfMecS">https://bit.ly/4rfMecS</a>], the court addressed a commission claim where a letter agreement required execution of a separate commission agreement as a condition precedent to receiving any commission. However, because the condition was not satisfied, the claim failed, showing that even where a writing exists, it may not establish the underlying right to a commission if the broker does not comply with conditions contained in that previously executed agreement.</p><p>In <em>Angelic Real Estate, LLC v. Aurora Props., LLC</em> (2d Dept., 2025) [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/4arSlUo">https://bit.ly/4arSlUo</a>], the court rejected a commission claim where the agreement did not clearly and unequivocally confer an exclusive right and the broker could not prove it was the “procuring cause” as required under common law. While this case involved a different context, the same principle applied: if exclusivity is not clear, causation will control.</p><h3 id="practical-business-case-for-written-brokerage-agreements">Practical Business Case for Written Brokerage Agreements</h3><p>Written brokerage agreements are risk-management tools. They prevent disputes about whether the broker was engaged at all, whether the engagement was exclusive, when and how the commission is earned, and how payment of compensation, if applicable, will be handled if the transaction is consummated through another channel or not at all.</p><p>While many real estate agents representing residential property sellers or landlords enter into exclusive agency and listing agreements providing clear parameters as to the payment of commissions, many commercial real estate brokers do not. It is recommended that all real estate brokerage firms, including commercial brokerages, enter into detailed agreements with their buyer/tenant or seller/landlord clients.</p><p>In 2026, buyer-side documentation is now especially important in light of the settlement in the <em>Sitzer/Burnett v. National Association of REALTORS®</em> case [<em>see</em> <a href="https://bit.ly/468YZxA">https://bit.ly/468YZxA</a>]. Compensation expectations and the scope of services should be discussed at the very initial stages, before any showings, before any offer strategy is discussed, and before any of the common transaction’s pressure points. As required by the Sitzer/Burnett settlement, with regard to residential transactions, the compensation structure needs to be agreed to in advance, and in writing, by all parties and must be clear and conspicuous. It must also be clearly disclosed that all commissions are negotiable and there are no set commissions under the law or otherwise.</p><h3 id="proposed-ny-legislation-written-buyer-representation-agreements">Proposed NY Legislation:<br>Written Buyer Representation Agreements</h3><p>In addition to the requirements established by existing case law, the market and policy environment also continues to develop with a move toward mandatory written buyer representation agreements. In the 2025–2026 legislative session in New York, Assembly Bill A8910 [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/3OIb1b6">https://bit.ly/3OIb1b6</a>] was introduced proposing an amendment to the Real Property Law to require buyer-broker agreements for certain services and to mandate clear and conspicuous compensation disclosures. Additionally, Assembly Bill A5499 [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/3Mvzgc2">https://bit.ly/3Mvzgc2</a>] similarly includes representation agreement requirements as part of broader brokerage and agency reforms. NYSAR has also publicly identified written buyer representation agreements as a legislative priority [<em>see </em><a href="https://bit.ly/46A3ph6">https://bit.ly/46A3ph6</a>].</p><p>This legislative movement follows the national settlement in Sitzer/Burnett and related litigation, which resulted in significant changes to broker compensation practices, placing emphasis on written buyer representation agreements and transparent compensation disclosures nationwide. Although the Sitzer/Burnett litigation arose outside New York, its practical impact has influenced brokerage practices across the country, including in New York, where policymakers and industry leaders are evaluating statutory requirements to formalize written buyer and seller agreements and to clarify compensation structures.</p><p>If enacted, these proposals would formalize what many firms already view as best practice: have buyers (and sellers) sign a written agreement early, ensure that compensation is disclosed clearly, and establish detailed ground rules between the parties so that disputes and costly litigations can be avoided.</p><h3 id="what-to-include-in-a-commission-agreement">What to Include in a Commission Agreement</h3><p>At a minimum, a strong seller or buyer agreement should address the scope of the representation (i.e., property, search area, and services). It should address whether the engagement is exclusive or non-exclusive and should be stated clearly. Of course, a clear recital of compensation and payment requirements must be included (i.e., the commission amount, who pays, when it is earned, and how shortfalls, if any, are handled).</p><p>A commission or representation agreement must also include provisions that clearly include the term (i.e., the duration) of the agreement, termination and expiration of the agreement, and any protection or holdover period, usually referred to as the “tail” period. Agreements may also contain language that protects a seller, such as “if, as, and when” language, in the event a transaction fails to close. For buyer agreements, clarity around compensation is essential. Now, particularly in light of Sitzer/Burnett, it is important that agreements detail whether a commission payment is expected from the seller/listing broker, directly from the buyer, or both.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The case law highlights the risks and issues that may arise without clear written terms and a provable causal chain. A claim for a commission can evaporate even where the broker invested real time and effort. With courts enforcing procuring cause and contract conditions strictly, and with the Sitzer/Burnett settlement and potential legislative initiatives moving toward mandatory written agreements, the safest approach is a written agreement which documents the engagement early, defines compensation clearly, and details the scope of the engagement concisely, ultimately preserving rights to commission in the event a dispute ever arises.</p><p><em>About the author: Legal Corner Column author John Dolgetta, Esq., is the principal of the law firm of Dolgetta Law, PLLC.

    <description><![CDATA[Month-over-month pending home sales rose in the Midwest and West, and declined in the Northeast and South.]]></description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON—U.S. pending home sales in January decreased by 0.8% from the prior month and 0.4% year-over-year, according to the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report released today.</p><p>Month-over-month pending home sales rose in the Midwest and West, and declined in the Northeast and South. Year-over-year pending home sales rose in the South and West and declined in the Northeast and Midwest.</p><blockquote>“Improving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,” said NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun. “With mortgage rates nearing 6%, an additional 5.5 million households that could not qualify for a mortgage one year ago would qualify at today’s lower rates. Most newly qualifying households do not act immediately, but based on past experience, about 10% could enter the market—potentially adding roughly 550,000 new homebuyers this year compared with last year.”</blockquote><p>“Unless housing supply increases, these additional potential buyers becoming active in the market could simply push up home prices. This will put increasing pressure on affordability, which is why it is critical to increase supply by building more homes. Fortunately, the House of Representatives recently passed the Housing for the 21st Century Act with strong bipartisan support, an important signal that addressing the nation’s housing shortage remains a shared priority. The legislation is a meaningful step toward expanding housing supply and removing barriers that make it harder for Americans to achieve homeownership,” Yun added.</p><p>While national pending home sales fell slightly in January, several local markets are showing notable year-over-year gains. Among the 50 largest metro areas, the following 10 markets posted the biggest annual increases in pending home sales, according to data from Realtor.com Economics:</p><p><strong>Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, AZ (+11.8%)<br>Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA-NH (+10.7%)<br>Charlotte–Concord–Gastonia, NC-SC (+10.7%)<br>San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont, CA (+8.9%)<br>Oklahoma City, OK (+8.7%)<br>St. Louis, MO-IL (+8.0%)<br>Virginia Beach–Chesapeake–Norfolk, VA-NC (+7.6%)<br>San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, CA (+7.5%)<br>San Antonio–New Braunfels, TX (+7.4)<br>Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, FL (+6.8%)</strong></p><h3 id="january-2026-national-pending-home-sales">January 2026 National Pending Home Sales</h3><p><br>0.8% decrease month over month<br>0.4% decrease year over year</p><h3 id="january-2026-regional-pending-home-sales">January 2026 Regional Pending Home Sales</h3><p><br><strong>Northeast</strong></p><p>5.7% decrease month over month<br>8.3% decrease year over year</p><p><strong>Midwest</strong></p><p>5.0% increase month over month<br>3.3% decrease year over year</p><p><strong>South</strong></p><p>4.5% decrease month over month<br>4.0% increase year over year</p><p><strong>West</strong></p><p>4.3% increase month over month<br>0.3% increase year over year</p><figure><img src="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2026/02/PHS----1000x1500-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/PHS----1000x1500-1.png 600w, https://realestateindepth.com/content/images/2026/02/PHS----1000x1500-1.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FARMINGDALE– The New York metropolitan housing market entered 2026 with rising home values, more contract activity, and persistent inventory challenges, according to new data released by OneKey MLS on Feb. 18.</p><p>Closed sales in the OneKey MLS service area declined 6.6% year-over-year to 3,503 in January 2026. However, the median sales price for all property types increased 4.3% to $677,777, reflecting ongoing price strength despite fewer transactions.</p><p>Single-family home sales, the region’s largest segment, fell 7.1% to 2,565, while median prices rose 4.7% to $748,500, underscoring steady demand for detached homes. Condominium sales increased 3.6% year-over-year, while co-op sales declined 13.6%. The median co-op sales price rose 2.3% to $301,900.</p><p>Inventory remains a key challenge. Homes for sale decreased 9.3% year-over-year to 11,977. The months' supply of inventory also fell to 2.9, maintaining competitive conditions across the region.</p><p>New listings dropped 7.0% year-over-year, reflecting continued seller caution and limiting buyer choices. Despite low supply, pending sales increased by 5.7%, signaling greater buyer engagement and potential growth in future closings.</p><p>Homes are selling faster.
